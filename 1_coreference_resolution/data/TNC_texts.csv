1,10.1177/0269881116675513,"The present study demonstrated the efficacy of a high dose of psilocybin administered under supportive conditions to decrease symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety, and to increase quality of life in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. Eleven of 17 therapeutically relevant measures fulfilled conservative criteria for demonstrating efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin (Table 4, Figure 3). The data show that psilocybin produced large and significant decreases in clinician-rated and self-rated measures of depression, anxiety or mood disturbance, and increases in measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and optimism. These effects were sustained at 6 months. For the clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety, respectively, the overall rate of clinical response at 6 months was 78% and 83% and the overall rate of symptom remission was 65% and 57%. Participants attributed to the high-dose experience positive changes in attitudes about life, self, mood, relationships and spirituality, with over 80% endorsing moderately or higher increased well-being or life satisfaction. These positive effects were reflected in significant corresponding changes in ratings by community observers (friends, family, work colleagues) of participant attitudes and behavior.The results substantially extend the findings of a recent double-blind pilot study with a lower dose of psilocybin (14 mg/70 kg) in cancer patients that showed non-significant trends for benefits of psilocybin compared with placebo (niacin) on measures of depression and anxiety, with some significant decreases relative to baseline demonstrated at 1 to 6 months (Grob et al., 2011). The time-course, magnitude, and qualitative features of the high dose of psilocybin on session days were consistent with those observed in previous studies in healthy volunteers (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2011; Johnson et al., 2012).The significant association of mystical-type experience (MEQ30) during Session 1 with most of the enduring changes in therapeutic outcome measures 5 weeks later (Figure 5) is consistent with previous findings showing that such experiences on session days predict long-term positive changes in attitudes, mood, behavior, and spirituality (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2008, 2011). For most measures, this relationship continued to be significant when the intensity of overall psilocybin effect was controlled in a partial correlation analysis. This suggests that mystical-type experience per se has an important role apart from overall intensity of drug effect. Finally, a mediation analysis further suggested that mystical-type experience has a mediating role in positive therapeutic response.The observed decreases in psychological distress and anxiety about death may relate to recent epidemiological findings that lifetime psilocybin use was associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress and suicidality (Hendricks et al., 2015).An innovative feature of the study design was that participants and staff monitors were given instructions that obscured the actual psilocybin dose conditions to facilitate blinding and minimize expectancy effects, which are believed to be a significant determinant of classic hallucinogen effects (Griffiths et al., 2006; Metzner et al., 1965). Evidence of some success of this blinding was provided in a post-study questionnaire completed by staff and by significant treatment effects observed after Session 1 in participants who received the very low dose of psilocybin. Although it was assumed that 1 mg/70 kg would be largely pharmacologically inactive, some pharmacological activity of this dose cannot be ruled out entirely. Thus, it might have been preferable to use an even lower dose of psilocybin (e.g. 0.01 mg/70 kg) to assure pharmacological inactivity while maintaining the benefit of the instruction that psilocybin would be administered on each session. Although the low-dose comparison condition and instructions to participants and staff facilitated blinding and minimized expectancy effects, it should be noted that these experimental design features may be difficult to implement in research settings that require complete disclosure of specific study conditions or arms.Several additional experimental limitations should be noted. Participants were crossed over to the alternative dose condition after 5 weeks. Although this allowed assessment of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin in all study participants, it precluded double-blind assessment of efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin based on across group comparisons after 5 weeks. As in previous research, the study documented enduring increases in positive changes in attitudes and mood on both the participant-rated Persisting Effects Questionnaire and on the Community Observer Questionnaire . However, neither of these measures has been independently validated. Likewise, although the finding of significant decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms on both participant-rated and clinician-rated measures is a strength, the inclusion of blinded clinician ratings would further strengthen the study. The relatively small sample (n = 51) that was highly educated and predominately White limits the generality of conclusions.Finally, it is important to note that the overall approach of treating cancer-related psychological distress with psilocybin is limited by a variety of exclusion criteria (see online Supplementary material) and by the significant time and cost of professional support provided before, during, and after the psilocybin session. Patients may also be reluctant to participate in such an intervention because high doses of psilocybin have sometimes been associated with transient episodes of psychological distress or anxiety in patients.The neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of psilocybin therapeutic effects remain speculative As a 5-HT2A agonist, the psilocybin metabolite psilocin directly and indirectly affects various brain cortical and subcortical areas and alters brain network dynamics Precisely how the enduring therapeutically relevant psilocybin effects are reflected in long-term alteration of cortical networks or other neuroplastic changes remains to be established.","When administered under psychologically supportive, double-blind conditions, a single dose of psilocybin produced substantial and enduring decreases in depressed mood and anxiety along with increases in quality of life and decreases in death anxiety in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. Ratings by patients themselves, clinicians, and community observers suggested these effects endured at least 6 months. The overall rate of clinical response at 6 months on clinician-rated depression and anxiety was 78% and 83%, respectively. A multisite study in a larger and more diverse patient population should be conducted to establish the generality and safety of psilocybin treatment of psychological distress associated with life-threatening cancer."
2,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.116,"The initial goals of this research project were to establish feasibility and safety for a hallucinogen treatment model in patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Following discussion with federal and state regulatory agencies as well as hospital institutional review board and research committees, a modest 0.2-mg/kg psilocybin dose was chosen. Although not comparable to higher doses of hallucinogens administered in the past to severely ill patients, the dose used here was still believed capable of inducing an alteration of consciousness with potential therapeutic benefit while optimizing patient safety. Determining safe parameters with this novel treatment paradigm is critical to establishing a strong foundation for this field of study that would allow for future investigations. Consistent with previous research, we found no untoward cardiovascular sequelae in our subject population.19 Minor HR and BP elevations after psilocybin administration were evidence only of a mild sympathomimetic effect. Holter monitoring did not identify increased cardiac arrhythmias in comparison with niacin placebo, even in subjects who presented with some baseline cardiac arrhythmia. Niacin may acutely lower BP through vasodilation35 but had minimal effects on BP and HR in our subjects, except for a reduction in diastolic BP that was noted 1 hour after administration of niacin. This transient effect may have contributed to our detection of a significant psilocybin effect at that time but cannot explain the significant effects of psilocybin over the subsequent intervals because the initial niacin-induced reduction of diastolic BP did not persist. We also observed no adverse psychological effects from the treatment. All subjects tolerated the treatment sessions well, with no indication of severe anxiety or a “bad trip.” The fact that psilocybin produced only modest effects on the anxious ego dissolution scale of the 5D-ASC confirmed this conclusion. When hallucinogens were administered to patients with terminal cancer in the 1960s and early 1970s, the occurrence of a profound psychospiritual experience was correlated with therapeutic outcome.10,12 Such transcendent states of consciousness are usually associated with higher doses of hallucinogens, so our expectation of demonstrating efficacy was limited.21 Common themes reported by subjects included examining how their illness had impacted their lives, relationships with family and close friends, and sense of ontological security. In addition, subjects reported powerful empathic cathexis to close friends and family members and examined how they wished to address their limited life expectancy. In monthly follow-up discussions, subjects reflected on insights and new perspectives gained during their psilocybin treatment. However, the frequency of these reports was not quantified. Although past researchers reported more pronounced therapeutic effects with a higher-dose model, even the lower dose of psilocybin used in the current study gave some indication of therapeutic benefit in quantitative psychological evaluations. In particular, we found that the STAI trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a sustained reduction in anxiety that reached significance at the 1- and 3-month points after treatment. This reduction might reflect a reduced level of stress and anxiety over time. Although the state anxiety on the STAI showed a modest elevation at 6 months, the change was not statistically significant and might have resulted from the deteriorating medical status of most subjects over time. Mood also improved for 2 weeks after treatment with psilocybin, with sustained improvement on the BDI reaching significance at the 6-month follow-up point. The POMS scores also reflected improved mood 2 weeks after receiving psilocybin. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward positive outcome. With a larger cohort of subjects and use of a higher dose of psilocybin, it seems possible that significant results would be obtained on these measures. Compared with placebo sessions, POMS scores were elevated in subjects immediately prior to psilocybin administration. The reasons for this difference in POMS scores 1 day before administration are not entirely clear. Subject expectations were unlikely to have played a role in the elevation of the POMS scores on the day before treatment because the elevation occurred regardless of treatment order. The most likely explanation for the elevation of POMS scores prior to treatment with psilocybin may be that subject randomization was not complete with regard to this instrument. Nonetheless, POMS scores declined after administration of psilocybin in 11 of 12 subjects, suggesting that psilocybin produces mood-elevating effects that persist after the acute effects of the drug. Another focus of the study was the effect of a 0.2-mg/kg psilocybin dose on somatic symptoms, particularly pain perception. In contrast to previous investigations, we did not find robust reductions in pain perception or lessened need for narcotic pain medication. In the 2 weeks following experimental treatment sessions, several subjects reported lessened pain, whereas others did not. There was no apparent difference between subjects treated with psilocybin and those treated with placebo (data not shown). Although this modest dose of psilocybin was not observed to impact pain, given the impressive reports of earlier researchers,6 this measure would certainly be indicated for study with higher doses. Although we used a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the drug order was almost always apparent to subjects and investigators whether the treatment was psilocybin or placebo. In fact, one consistent subject critique of the study was that the placebo sessions were perceived as far less worthwhile than those with psilocybin. Many of the subjects suggested that future protocols provide the opportunity for a second psilocybin session several weeks after the first. The general consensus among subjects was that a follow-up experience with psilocybin would reinforce and extend the perceived therapeutic effects of the initial session. Future studies also will need to address the issue of controlling for a placebo effect that might otherwise be attributed to the active treatment. Given the subjects' grave prognosis and limited life expectancy, we decided to provide all subjects with an opportunity to experience the experimental medicine and to serve as their own control. Although we believed that to be the ethical course to take, given the life circumstances subjects were encountering, the protocol design contains some inherent limitations. A better experimental design might incorporate an independent control group, receiving only either placebo treatment or a conventional psychopharmacological intervention. Although there is no question that the extensive attention paid to the subjects influenced outcomes, the unique qualities of the psilocybin experience in facilitating strong therapeutic bonds and ameliorating underlying psychological demoralization are important factors worthy of further exploration. Another limitation of this study was variability in the extent of contact with subjects after treatment. A minimum contact of 1 hour monthly was established, but variability in additional ad hoc communication depended on the needs and wishes of the subjects, some of whom were near death compared with others who were more functional. Despite the limitations, this study demonstrates that the careful and controlled use of psilocybin may provide an alternative model for the treatment of conditions that are often minimally responsive to conventional therapies, including the profound existential anxiety and despair that often accompany advanced-stage cancers. A recent review from the psilocybin research group at Johns Hopkins University describes the critical components necessary for ensuring subject safety in hallucinogen research.36 Taking into account these essential provisions for optimizing safety as well as adhering to strict ethical standards of conduct for treatment facilitators, the results provided herein indicate the safety and promise of continued investigations into the range of medical effects of hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin.",
3,10.1124/pr.115.011478,"Dr. Albert Hofmann, the natural products chemist who accidently discovered the effects of LSD in 1943 while working at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland, wrote an autobiographical account of his discovery titled LSD: My Problem Child (Hofmann, 1979b). In his book, Hofmann talks about the potential of LSD, which he had hoped would be a promising new tool for psychiatry, but also expresses dismay at the social turbulence that ensued when “LSD was swept up in the huge wave of an inebriant mania that began to spread over the Western world, above all the United States…” (Hofmann, 1979b). Hofmann died in 2008 at the age of 102 years; but in his later years, he was delighted to see that real science had begun to take a thorough approach to unraveling the psychopharmacological mysteries of LSD, which he had always believed would eventually prove to be a miracle drug for psychiatry.With that in mind, if the positive therapeutic effects of psychedelics continue to be validated by additional well designed clinical studies, it opens up a whole new dimension of medical research. If psilocybin or LSD can acutely abolish depression or anxiety after one or only a few treatments, the question must be asked, “How does that occur?” There are many who believe that such improvement must be related to neurochemical effects, or neuroadaptation, and refuse to believe that the mystical experience may be relevant. Yet both modern and older studies consistently find that those who experience the most profound mystical experiences invariably receive the greatest symptom improvement. Of course, as reductionists, it is understood that the mystical experience must have neurochemical correlates. Even so, understanding what they are, how and why they occur, and how they lead to therapeutic improvement should shed light on the underlying deficits in brain function that lead to these disorders in the first place. Before-and-after brain imaging studies of patients with depression, anxiety, or addictive disorders will show how brain connectivity has changed as a result of psychedelic treatment. To understand these disorders at the present time with standard state-of-the-art approaches involves a sort of “fishing expedition,” searching for biomarkers that might be clues to the basis of the underlying disorder. Genome-wide association studies plow through many thousands or hundreds of thousands of genes, searching for candidates that might be the underlying causes of affective disorders. One generally cannot do prospective studies, to compare the brain function of the normal patient prior to the onset of his or her disease, and then examine it again after therapeutic improvement. Rather, one begins with a patient who is already sick, and then if therapeutic improvement occurs, usually over a long period of time, one tries to understand how it happened. By contrast, some of the recent treatments of anxiety and depression with psilocybin or LSD are so dramatic, and happen so quickly, that there must be some overt measureable changes in brain function or connectivity that correlate with therapeutic improvement. Learning what these are is the next big challenge, a process that promises to completely revolutionize the way we approach discovering better treatments for a host of human psychiatric disorders.Considering the most recent scientific and clinical developments in understanding the actions of psychedelics, a statement made in 1980 by Dr. Stanislav Grof seems particularly relevant today: “It does not seem to be an exaggeration to say that psychedelics, used responsibly and with proper caution, would be for psychiatry what the microscope is for biology and medicine or the telescope is for astronomy. These tools make it possible to study important processes that under normal circumstances are not available for direct observation” (Grof, 1980).",
4,10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30065-7,"In this open-label, single-arm pilot study, we sought to examine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to patients with treatment-resistant depression as a prelude to a larger randomised controlled trial. Our results support the view that, done with appropriate safeguards (eg, careful screening and adequate therapeutic support), psilocybin can be safely administered to this patient group.Because this was a small-scale feasibility study with an open-label design, strong inferences cannot be made about the treatment's therapeutic efficacy. However, the data do suggest that further research is warranted. The response rate to psilocybin was 67% (n=8) at 1 week after treatment (HAM-D and BDI), and seven of these eight patients also met criteria for remission. Moreover, 58% (n=7) of the patients maintained their response for 3 months, and 42% (n=5) remained in remission. It is also worth noting that psilocybin has a favourable toxicity profile and is not associated with compulsive drug-seeking behaviours in animals or human beings. The side-effects that we noted were minor, and expected in light of previous studies of psilocybin.Spontaneous recovery in refractory depression is rare, and many of the patients in the present study reported having depression for much of their adult lives (mean estimated illness duration 17·8 years [SD 8]). Key questions for future research therefore should address why the therapeutic effect observed in the present study is so large, and if it can be replicated when tighter experimental controls are introduced. Because the treatment in our study consisted of not just two psilocybin administrations but also psychological support before, during, and after these sessions, as well as a positive therapeutic environment for the sessions, the relative effects of these factors need to be determined, which can only be done by conducting further trials with appropriate control conditions. A logical next step would be to carry out a placebo-controlled randomised trial in which the level of therapist contact is consistent between conditions. This would enable any between-group differences in clinical outcomes to be attributed to psilocybin rather than the psychological support provided. However, a positive interaction between these variables seems likely, and inert placebo-based blinds are known to be ineffective in studies involving conspicuous experimental interventions, because patients can easily discern whether they are in the active condition or not. Use of an active placebo for the control condition might therefore be worth considering. Additionally, randomised comparative efficacy trials (eg, with an optional crossover component) incorporating another treatment for refractory depression (eg, ketamine infusion) could also be explored. The magnitude and persistence of the antidepressant effects observed here are not incongruent with what has been observed previously with psilocybin in chronic psychiatric conditions. For example, 80% of long-term heavy tobacco smokers demonstrated abstinence from smoking 6 months after two treatment sessions with psilocybin. 18 Alcohol-dependent patients demonstrated significantly reduced drinking behaviours over 8 months after one or two psilocybin sessions. 19 Significantly decreased anxiety and depression scores were observed 3 and 6 months after a single dose of psilocybin in patients with anxiety related to end-stage cancer, 15 and improvements in wellbeing lasting for more than 1 year were observed in healthy individuals given a single dose of psilocybin. 8 Rapid and enduring decreases in depressive symptoms were also recently found in a small-scale feasibility trial involving the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca. It is important to consider the limitations of this pilot study; for example, although all patients showed some clinical improvements for at least 3 weeks after treatment, and no serious or unexpected adverse reactions were observed, enduring improvements beyond 3 weeks were not observed universally, and five of the 12 patients showed a degree of relapse at 3 months. One should be cautious of the potential for inflated effect sizes in early trials, particularly when the sample size is small. That all patients showed some improvement in their depressive symptoms for up to 3 weeks after treatment could be suggestive of an expectancy bias. It may also be relevant that most patients in this trial were self-referring and, thus, actively sought this treatment. Psychedelics are known to promote suggestibility, 28 which might have further enhanced positive outcomes. Future double-blind randomised controlled trials could address the role of expectancy and suggestibility by measuring and controlling these variables. For example, patients could be asked about their pre-treatment expectations, suggestions could be controlled between conditions, and outcomes from self-referred patients could be compared with those from patients referred via clinicians. From a more pragmatic perspective, if expectancy or suggestibility are found to be influential in the context of psychedelic therapy, they could be treated as exploitable components of the treatment model rather than confounding variables. Serotonergic antidepressants have been found to down-regulate the primary receptor target of psilocybin (the 5-HT 2A receptor) and attenuated subjective responses to psychedelics have previously been reported in individuals chronically medicated with serotonergic antidepressants. 29 Thus, patients may be required to withdraw from concurrent antidepressant medication before receiving psilocybin and this should only ever be done with care. In conclusion, we sought to assess the safety and tolerability of psilocybin plus psychological support in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. Our findings support the feasibility of this approach and the magnitude and duration of the post-treatment reductions in symptom severity motivate further controlled research. Psilocybin has a novel pharmacological action in comparison with currently available treatments for depression (ie, 5-HT 2A receptor agonism) and thus could constitute a useful addition to available therapies for the treatment of depression.",
5,10.1073/pnas.1119598109,"The fMRI studies reported here revealed significant and consistent outcomes. Psilocybin significantly decreased brain blood flow and venous oxygenation in a manner that correlated with its subjective effects, and significantly decreased the positive coupling of two key structural hubs (the mPFC and the PCC). Our use of fMRI to measure resting-state brain activity after a psychedelic is unique, and because the results are unexpected, they require some explanation. The effect of psilocybin on resting-state brain activity has been measured before with PET and glucose metabolism (8). This study found a global increase in glucose metabolism after oral psilocybin, which is inconsistent with our fMRI results. One possible explanation for this discrepancy relates to the fact that the radiotracer used to measure glucose metabolism (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) has a long half-life (110 min). Thus, the effects of psilocybin, as measured by PET, are over much greater timescales than indexed by our fMRI measures. It is therefore possible that phasic or short-term effects of psilocybin show some rebound that is detected by longer-term changes in glucose metabolism. More direct measures of neural activity will help inform this hypothesis, but in support of the inference that psilocybin does decrease neural activity, direct recordings of cortical local field potentials (LFPs) in rats found broadband decreases in resting state LFP power after psilocybin infusion—including γ-power (9)—changes in which are known to correlate with changes in the BOLD signal (10). It has been commonly assumed that psychedelics work by increasing neural activity; however, our results put this into question. Psilocin is a mixed serotonin receptor agonist, but there is a general consensus that the characteristic subjective and behavioral effects of psychedelics are initiated via stimulation of serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 2A receptors (11). It is possible that the deactivations observed in the present studies were caused by stimulation of 5-HT receptors other than 5-HT2A; however, this seems unlikely given that the affinity of psychedelics for the 5-HT2A receptor correlates with their potency (12) and 5-HT2A antagonists block the subjective effects of psychedelics (13). There is a large body of preclinical evidence that stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors increases GABAergic transmission and pyramidal cell inhibition (14–21), which may explain the deactivations observed here (Figs. 2 and 4). fMRI studies with serotonergic compounds that stimulate other 5-HT receptors, such as the 5-HT2C (22) or (mainly) the 5-HT1A receptor (23), have not found comparable results to those shown here, and 5-HT2A receptors are present in high concentrations in the cortical regions that were significantly deactivated and decoupled after psilocybin (Table S2). Stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor increases excitation in the host cell by reducing outward potassium currents (24). Thus, if the 5-HT2A receptor did mediate the observed deactivations, then it may have been via 5-HT2A-induced excitation of fast-spiking interneurons terminating on pyramidal cells (e.g., ref. 24) or 5-HT2A-induced excitation of pyramidal cells projecting onto interneurons (25). Regardless of how these effects were initiated at the receptor level, it is necessary for us to offer a functional explanation for them. It is noteworthy that the regions which showed the most consistent deactivations after psilocybin (e.g., the PCC and mPFC) are also those that show disproportionately high activity under normal conditions (26). For example, metabolism in the PCC is ∼20% higher than most other brain regions (27), yet psilocybin decreased its blood flow by up to 20% in some subjects. There is some mystery about the function of the PCC; its large size, buffered location, and rich vasculature means that it is well protected from damage. The high metabolic activity of the PCC and the default-mode network (DMN) with which is it associated (26) has led some to speculate about its functional importance, positing a role in consciousness (28) and high-level constructs, such as the self (29) or “ego” (30, 31). Indeed, the DMN is known to be activated during self-referencing (28) and other high-level functions linked to the self-construct (27). Moreover, DMN regions are also known to host the highest number of cortico-cortical connections in the brain, making them important “connector hubs” (32). These hubs may be critical for efficient information transfer in the brain by allowing communication between different regions via the fewest number of connections (33). However, such an integrative function would confer a significant responsibility on these regions, which may explain why their deactivation has such a profound effect on consciousness, as shown here. These results may have implications beyond explaining how psilocybin works in the brain by implying that the DMN is crucial for the maintenance of cognitive integration and constraint under normal conditions. This finding is consistent with Aldous Huxley's “reducing valve” metaphor (34) and Karl Friston's “free-energy principle” (35), which propose that the mind/brain works to constrain its experience of the world. The pharmaco-physiological interaction results were particularly intriguing, revealing significant decreases in the positive coupling between the PCC and mPFC after psilocybin. This result can be understood in terms of a regression of PCC activity on mPFC activity, in which the regression slope decreases. This finding can either be interpreted as a decrease in the (backward or top-down) connectivity from prefrontal to parietal regions or, equivalently, an increase in the reciprocal (forward or bottom-up) direction from parietal to prefrontal regions. This asymmetrical change in coupling, induced by psilocybin, is consistent with a reduction in the sensitivity of superficial pyramidal cells in the parietal region targeted by prefrontal afferents, which may or may not be associated with a compensatory increase in the influence of parietal regions on prefrontal activity. Whatever the underlying synaptic mechanisms, these results provide clear evidence for a perturbation in reciprocal coupling between these two association areas and speak to a rebalancing of hierarchical activity in distributed high-level modes. Finally, consistent with their history of use as adjuncts to psychotherapy, the idea has recently re-emerged that psychedelics may be useful in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders (36). It seems relevant therefore that activity in (37) and connectivity with (38) the mPFC is known to be elevated in depression and normalized after effective treatment (39). The mPFC was consistently deactivated by psilocybin (Fig. 4) and the magnitude of the deactivations correlated with the drug's subjective effects (Fig. 3). Depression has been characterized as an “overstable” state, in which cognition is rigidly pessimistic (39). Trait pessimism has been linked to deficient 5-HT2A receptor stimulation (40, 41), particularly in the mPFC (40), and mPFC hyperactivity has been linked to pathological brooding (42). Recent work has shown that psilocybin can increase subjective well-being (4) and trait openness (43) several months after an acute experience, and depression scores in terminal cancer patients were significantly decreased 6 mo after treatment with psilocybin (2). Our results suggest a biological mechanism for this: decreased mPFC activity via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. Further work is required to test this hypothesis and the putative utility of psilocybin in depression We also observed decreased CBF in the hypothalamus after psilocybin (Fig. 2), which may explain anecdotal reports that psychedelics reduce symptoms of cluster headaches (44). Increased hypothalamic CBF was observed during acute headache in cluster headache sufferers (45) and inhibition of the hypothalamus via direct electrical stimulation can provide therapeutic relief for this condition. To conclude, here we used an advanced and comprehensive fMRI protocol to image the brain effects of psilocybin. These studies offer the most detailed account to date on how the psychedelic state is produced in the brain. The results suggest decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's connector hubs, permitting an unconstrained style of cognition.",
6,10.1177/0269881116675512,"Single moderate-dose psilocybin, in conjunction with psychotherapy, produced rapid, robust, and sustained clinical benefits in terms of reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer. This pharmacological finding is novel in psychiatry in terms of a single dose of a medication leading to immediate anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects with enduring (e.g. weeks to months) clinical benefits. Even though it is not possible to attribute causality of the experimental drug (in terms of sustained clinical benefit) after the crossover, the post-crossover data analyses of the two dosing sequences suggest that the clinical benefits, in terms of reduction of cancer-related anxiety and depression, of single-dose psilocybin (in conjunction with psychotherapy) may be sustained for longer than 7 weeks post-dosing, and that they may endure for as long as 8 months post-psilocybin dosing. The acute and sustained anti-depressant effects of psilocybin in this trial are consistent with a recently published open-label study of oral psilocybin treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in which psilocybin (25 mg) was associated with 1 week and 3 months post-psilocybin anti-depressant effects (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). The within-group analyses for the primary outcome measures demonstrate that immediately after receiving psilocybin there is a marked reduction in anxiety and depression scores for both the psilocybin first and niacin first groups. Also, the magnitude of psilocybin-induced change across each participant’s active psilocybin treatment session did not differ across treatment group for any of the primary outcome measures. Together, this suggests that the pharmacological/psilocybin intervention produced rapid anti-depressant and anxiolytic clinical benefits. Both groups demonstrated significant clinical improvements in anxiety/depression from baseline relative to the final assessment. It is unclear from the data whether the sustained benefits in clinical outcomes were due to psilocybin alone or some interactive effect of psilocybin plus the targeted psychotherapy. Future research would be necessary to separate out the various therapeutic contributions of psilocybin versus psychotherapy. Psilocybin was associated with substantial anti-depressant response rates (as high as approximately 80% at 6.5 months follow-up). There have been several meta-analyses of placebo controlled trials exploring the efficacy of anti-depressants in the treatment of cancer-related depression and they have generally failed to show a clear effect of anti-depressant treatment over placebo (Iovieno et al., 2011; Laoutidis and Mathiak, 2013; Ostuzzi et al., 2015). In a meta-analyses of anti-depressants for major depressive disorder in patients with comorbid medical disorders (including cancer), anti-depressants were more effective than placebo in some medical conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS, post-stroke) but not in cancer patients, where the anti-depressants performed about as well as the approximately 40% placebo response rate (Iovieno et al., 2011) Psilocybin decreased cancer-related demoralization (e.g. loss of meaning/hope/purpose, desire for hastened death) and hopelessness, while improving spiritual wellbeing, general life satisfaction, and quality of life. While a minority of patients with advanced or terminal cancer experience clinically relevant existential/spiritual distress, when it occurs its effects are highly consequential (e.g. decreased quality of life, increased depressive and anxiety symptoms, increased desire for hastened death, increased suicidal ideation and behaviors) (Puchalski, 2012) and improving spiritual wellbeing (e.g. through a pharmacological-psychosocial intervention) could serve as a buffer against these negative clinical outcomes. Although affect/anxiety towards death did not improve in the short-term or longer-term follow-up period, psilocybin was associated with improved attitudes and adaptations to death at the 6.5-month follow-up. More research into this important therapeutic area is warranted. Psilocybin experiences were reported as highly meaningful and spiritual, and associated with positive cognitive, affective, spiritual, and behavioral effects lasting weeks to months. This finding is consistent with prior research administering psilocybin to normal volunteers (Doblin, 1991; Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008, 2011; Pahnke, 1963). There were no serious AEs, either medical or psychiatric, in the trial that were attributed to psilocybin. Since the early 1990s, approximately 2000 doses of psilocybin (ranging from low to high doses) have been safely administered to humans in the United States and Europe, in carefully controlled scientific settings, with no reports of any medical or psychiatric serious AEs, including no reported cases of prolonged psychosis or HPPD (Studerus et al., 2011). This finding is consistent with a US population (2001–2004 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health) based study that found no associations between lifetime use of any of the serotoninergic psychedelics (including psilocybin) and increased rates of mental illness (Krebs and Johansen, 2013). It is important to monitor closely for the emergence of transient difficult psychological states (e.g. anxiety, paranoia) in these trials and to manage them. Difficult experiences are not necessarily pathological and can be understood as part of the therapeutic process (e.g. working through cancer-related psychological or existential distress through challenging encounters or emotionally charged confrontations with cancer-related fearful imagery or symbolism) (Carbonaro et al., 2016).This trial was limited by a relatively small sample size, a non-nationally representative cancer patient population (e.g. 62% women, 90% Caucasian), which decreases generalizability, a crossover design that limited the interpretation of clinical benefits after the crossover, and the use of a control with limited blinding. There is evidence from animal research that serotoninergic psychedelics exert anxiolytic-like effects (Nichols, 2015). Several trials using animal models of anxiety demonstrated acute anxiolytic effects of the serotoninergic psychedelic 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), a non-selective 5-HT2a/2c agonist (Nic Dhonnchadha et al., 2003; Ripoll et al., 2005, 2006). In two rodent studies, one with 5HT2A knockout mice (Weisstaub et al., 2006) and the other in rats with anti-sense-mediated 5HT2A downregulation (Cohen, 2005), the rodents displayed decreased anxiety-like behavior and in the trial with the 5HT2A knockout mice (Weisstaub et al., 2006), restoration of 5HT2A receptors in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) re-established anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, in humans, fronto-limbic 5HT2A density has been correlated with anxiety symptoms (Frokjaer et al., 2008). Together, these data suggest that 5HT2A downregulation may explain some of the rapid and sustained anxiolytic effects of psilocybin (Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). There is growing evidence that the serotoninergic psychedelics produce rapid and sustained anti-depressant effects (Nichols, 2015). In two recently published open-label trials, one using a single dose of ayahuasca (Osorio et al., 2015) and the other using two doses of oral psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016), acute and enduring anti-depressant effects were reported. In addition to these two open-label trials, there are several lines of evidence supporting using 5HT2A agonists to treat depression. In considering changes at the 5HT2A receptor as a potential mechanism of action: cortical 5HT2A receptor expression is increased in postmortem samples of patients with depression who display suicidality (Mendelson, 2000; Pandey et al., 2002; Shelton et al., 2009); depressed patients with elevated pessimism display increased PFC 5HT2A receptor binding compared to control participants (Bhagwagar et al., 2006; Meyer, 2012; Meyer et al., 2003); and sustained treatment with various anti-depressants (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic anti-depressants) have been associated with a reduction of 5HT2A receptor density (Gomez-Gil et al., 2004; Yamauchi et al., 2006). The glutamate system may explain some of the anti-depressant effects of psilocybin. In rodents, serotoninergic psychedelics enhance cortical glutamatergic transmission, especially in the medial PFC, and increase activation of cortical α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997). In a trial in which rats received DOI, there was a significant increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in neocortical areas (Vaidya et al., 1997). Increased AMPA activation and BDNF expression as biomarkers of anti-depressant effects are supported by: cortical AMPA activation is known to stimulate the expression of cortical BDNF (associated with neuronal growth, differentiation and synaptogenesis) (Hsu et al., 2015); decreased cortical BDNF is associated with major depression in humans (Duman, 2004); and cortical BDNF normalizes with anti-depressant treatment (Sen et al., 2008; Shimizu et al., 2003). Similarly, ketamine (the only other known acute and short-term sustained anti-depressant) is theorized to exert its anti-depressant effects via cortical AMPA activation (Zanos et al., 2016) and BDNF expression (Lepack et al., 2014). However, the anti-depressant effects of single-dose ketamine in patients with TRD typically last no more than several days up to 1–2 weeks, not several weeks to months (DeWilde et al., 2015). Neuroimaging research with psilocybin is beginning to suggest potential anti-depressant mechanisms of action at the level of brain structure activity and network connectivity. Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging research in normal volunteers under the influence of psilocybin has demonstrated decreased activity in the medial PFC and decreased connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2014). The former is significant because depressive symptoms have been associated with increased activity in the medial PFC (Drevets et al., 2008; Farb et al., 2011) and normalization of medial PFC activity has been demonstrated with anti-depressant treatment (Deakin et al., 2008; Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011; Kennedy et al., 2007); and the latter because patients with major depression (compared to controls) have demonstrated increased DMN connectivity (Berman et al., 2011, Grecius et al., 2007). Moderate-dose psilocybin occasioned mystical-type experiences in the cohort of cancer patients studied, and the intensity of the subjective mystical experience significantly mediated (e.g. suggestive of causality) clinical benefit (e.g. reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms) in the medium term (e.g. 6 weeks post-dose 1). This result matches with descriptive historical data from open-label LSD-assisted psychotherapy trials for psycho-spiritual distress associated with terminal cancer, in which the mystical experience was reported as being an integral part of the therapeutic effect (Grof and Halifax, 1977). It is further corroborated by recent open-label trials using psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat tobacco addiction (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2014) and alcoholism (Bogenschutz et al., 2015) showing significant correlations between the mystical experience and improved clinical outcomes. This finding suggests a potential psycho-spiritual mechanism of action: the mystical state of consciousness. The mystical experience is likely to be one of several mediators that transmit the effect of psilocybin to changes in anxiety and/or depression. Further enquiry into how particular dimensions of the mystical experience relate to reductions in anxiety and/or depression in this population and others, and what factors best predict or promote mystical experiences, is warranted.","In conclusion, single moderate-dose psilocybin (in conjunction with psychotherapy) was safely administered to a cohort of patients with cancer-related psychological distress (e.g. anxiety, depression). It produced rapid and sustained anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (for at least 7 weeks but potentially as long as 8 months), decreased cancer-related existential distress, increased spiritual wellbeing and quality of life, and was associated with improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects of psilocybin. Psilocybin, administered in conjunction with appropriate psychotherapy, could become a novel pharmacological-psychosocial treatment modality for cancer-related psychological and existential distress. Further empirical research is needed definitively to establish its safety and efficacy."
7,10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020,"In 1953, the British research psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond was investigating the psychotomimetic (psychosis mimicking) effects of mescaline, a psychedelic drug derived from the peyote cactus. The British author Aldous Huxley learned of Osmond's work and struck up a correspondence, requesting that Osmond supervise a personal psychedelic experience. Huxley's subsequent mescaline experience would become the subject of his famous book “The Doors of Perception” (Huxley, 1954). Like many before and after him, Huxley was profoundly affected by his experiences with psychedelics and in 1956 sought with Osmond a satisfactory term for this class of drugs. At the time, “psychotomimetics” and “hallucinogens” were popular, but both men felt that these referred to mere aspects of the drug experience and not its essential character. Huxley suggested “phanerothyme,” intending to mean “bringing forth the spirit or soul” (Huxley et al., 1977), and Osmond offered “psychedelic” combining the Greek words for “mind” or “soul” (psychē) with “dclôsē,” meaning “to manifest.” While it was Osmond's “psychedelic” that would stick, it is telling that both men were searching for a word that could denote the same essential property, i.e., psychedelic's ability to make manifest latent aspects of the mind. In 1943, Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered the extraordinary psychological properties of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (Hofmann, 1980) and the first reports on its effects appeared in scientific journals in the late 1940s. These papers immediately highlighted LSD's potential to be psychologically agitative. The first English language publication was released in 1950 and here the authors reported: “the effect of LSD was a transitory toxic state, disturbing the barrier of repression and permitting a re-examination of significant experiences of the past that were sometimes relived with a frightening realism.” (Busch and Johnson, 1950) In the following years, psychedelics became one of the most researched classes of psychoactive drug in science, with several hundred relevant publications (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979). During these years, the focus shifted from psychedelics as psychotomimetics to psychedelics as psychotherapeutic adjuncts, with major international conferences on the topic (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979) and even the construction of purpose-built psychedelic treatment centers (Sandison, 2001). Political pressure in the late 1960s led to the illegalization of psychedelics and this had a significant negative impact on legitimate scientific research (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979; Lee and Shlain, 1985)—a problem that continues today (Nutt et al., 2013). Despite this however, there has been a resurgence of scientific interest in psychedelics in recent years (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Nichols, 2004; Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008; Moreno et al., 2006; Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007; Grob et al., 2011; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a). The dominant theoretical and therapeutic approach during the early era of psychedelic research was psychoanalytic. Psychedelics were used therapeutically under the rationale that they work to lower psychological defenses to allow personal conflicts to come to the fore that can then be worked through with a therapist (Cohen, 1972). A related model was that the relinquishment of “ego” enabled profound existential or “peak” experiences to occur that could have a lasting positive impact on behavior and outlook (Savage, 1962). Innumerable cases of apparent spontaneous insights about “self” or “nature” exist in the literature on psychedelics (Cattell, 1954; Sandison, 1954; Sandison and Whitelaw, 1957; Denber, 1958; Hausner and Dolezal, 1965; Torda, 1969; Cohen, 1972; Grof, 1982) and reports of “ego-dissolution” or “disintegration” are commonplace among those who have experienced the effects of these drugs (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2010; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b). Some psychiatrists even believed that psychedelics could provide the necessary scientific evidence for major psychoanalytic hypotheses (Sandison, 1954; Cohen, 1972; Grof, 1982). For example, one enthused: “The phenomenology of the psychodynamic experiences in LSD sessions is to a large extent in agreement with the basic concepts of classical psychoanalysis… Observations from LSD psychotherapy could be considered laboratory proof of the basic Freudian premises.” (Grof, 1982). Psychoanalytic theory dominated psychiatry in the 1950s but after influential critiques (Eysenck, 1973), the cognitive revolution (Neisser, 1967) and significant pharmacological developments in psychiatry (Ban, 2001a,b; Fink, 2010), its influence significantly waned. As illustrated in Figure 1, despite over a century since its inception, psychoanalysis has failed to establish itself as a science of the mind. This may be because its hypotheses are hollow (Webster, 1995) or because they do not easily lend themselves to controlled experiment. In contrast, cognitive psychology is a mechanistic framework for describing observable phenomena that has become the natural bedfellow for human neuroscience. In comparison with the spectacular success of cognitive psychology, what should we make of the relative stagnancy of psychoanalysis? Is psychoanalysis scientifically redundant? Its fiercest critics claim that it is a belief system, a tautology with untestable hypotheses (Webster, 1995) but others claim that it has considerable explanatory value but could benefit from a closer integration with cognitive neuroscience (Kandel, 1999; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010; Panksepp and Solms, 2012). The present article takes this latter view and argues that the most realistic way forward for psychoanalysis as a science is for its most tangible hypotheses to be simplified and applied within the framework of cognitive neuroscience. Here we take the view that this is a necessary concession for psychoanalysis if it is to develop its credibility as a model of the mind. In what follows, a roadmap is presented for how scientific research with psychedelics can assist the integration of psychoanalysis with cognitive neuroscience in order to further our understanding of human consciousness. This is motivated by the view that psychoanalysis can contribute something substantial to the mind sciences because it bridges an explanatory gap that has been left vacant by cognitive psychology. This gap only exists because cognitive psychology (rightly) focuses on phenomena that can be observed and manipulated by controlled experiment but crucially, without psychedelic drugs, it is virtually impossible to bring the core phenomena of psychoanalytic theory into an observable space. Freud famously said of dreams that they provide privileged access to the workings of the unconscious mind (Freud, 1937) but research on dreaming is fraught with difficulties because [despite the phenomenon of lucid dreaming (Ogilvie et al., 1982)] the dream experience cannot be easily reflected on and reported in real-time, and neither can its onset and offset be easily controlled. Thus, Freud's cherished “royal road” has not proved particularly regal and a more practical alternative is required if key psychoanalytic theories are to be incorporated into the mind sciences.This article argues that controlled studies with psychedelics are capable of providing major new insights into the nature of the mind and how it arises from brain activity. This is because the mind must be thoroughly deconstructed in order for us to become cognizant of its constituents and how they interact to give rise to global phenomena. The unique scientific value of psychedelics rests on their ability to selectively target processes that appear to be critical for the maintenance of normal waking consciousness. In addressing the action of psychedelic drugs on the brain, this article begins at the cellular level before progressing to the systems level. The intention is to offer a comprehensive account of how psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness. Somewhat uniquely, psychedelics can be studied at a range of epistemological levels; from molecular pharmacology (Gonzalez-Maeso and Sealfon, 2009) to psychoanalytic psychology (Cohen, 1964; Grof, 1982), few topics can engage scientists from as wide a range of disciplines. This reflects not only the special research value of psychedelics but also the immensity of the challenge involved in understanding them; especially, if the intention is to develop a comprehensive account of how psychedelics affect the brain to alter consciousness. The present article should therefore be read with an acknowledgement that this quest is on-going. Before we begin, it is necessary to enter some important caveats. Firstly, it needs to be stated that those looking for evidence for the authenticity of aspects of Freudian theory will be left dissatisfied by this article. Categorically, this is not its aim. This challenge requires a thorough review of the phenomenology of relevant altered states of consciousness (e.g., the psychedelic state) and this is something that has been attempted before (Carhart-Harris, 2007; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). Thus, due to space limitations, this article's treatment of the relevant phenomenology is relatively superficial. Instead it places its focus on the system-level mechanics of the psychedelic state as an exemplar of a regressive8 style of cognition that can also be observed in REM sleep and early psychosis. Some proponents of psychoanalysis may feel that this mechanistic approach has little relevance to psychoanalysis in its hermeneutic or interpretative guise. However, the inherent subjectivity of this aspect of psychoanalysis means that it is difficult to see how it can ever significantly impinge on the scientific study of the mind and brain. Indeed, Freud acknowledged that it was his “metapsychology” that had the most to offer science (Freud, 1949), and at least as a first step, this is where psychoanalytic theory (rather than psychoanalytic practice) should look to develop its scientific credibility. Briefly, for readers who are unfamiliar with Freudian metapsychology and wish to understand it better, his original material should be read (e.g., Freud, 1927, 1949; Freud et al., 1957) and the following review articles may be useful (Carhart-Harris et al., 2008; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). For those interested in the rich phenomenology of the psychedelic experience and how this relates to Freudian and/or Jungian descriptions of “the unconscious mind,” the following references may be of interest (Sandison and Whitelaw, 1957; Huxley, 1959; Cohen, 1964; Grof, 1982; Merkur, 1998; Sandison, 2001). Lastly, it is necessary to state that questions related to the safety of scientific research with psychedelics will not be addressed here. However, evidence strongly supports the position that, conducted with appropriate caution, research with psychedelics presents a low risk of harm to study participants","This article has argued that scientific research with psychedelic drugs can have a revitalizing effect on psychoanalysis and an informing influence on mainstream psychology and psychiatry. Rather than discuss the content and interpretation of psychoanalytically-relevant material, we have adopted a mechanistic approach, in keeping with the mainstream cognitive neuroscience. This article proposes that a distinction can be made between two fundamentally different modes of cognition: primary and secondary consciousness. Primary consciousness is associated with unconstrained cognition and less ordered (higher-entropy) neurodynamics, whereas secondary consciousness is associated with constrained cognition and more ordered neurodynamics (i.e., that strikes an evolutionarily advantageous balance between order and disorder - that may or more not be perfectly “critical”). It is hoped that this mechanistic model will help catalyze a synthesis between psychoanalytic theory and cognitive neuroscience that can be mutually beneficial to both disciplines. It is a fair criticism of this paper that it has given insufficient consideration to the phenomenological content of the relevant altered states of consciousness, and to the specifics of Freudian theory, and so by neglecting this, has failed to present a sufficiently compelling case that these states have anything to do with psychoanalytic theory. To some extent, this charge can be conceded; however, as outlined in the introduction, the intention of this paper was to develop a mechanistic account of altered states of consciousness based on the quantity of entropy, and this task has demanded a substantial amount of space. A more thorough discussion of the phenomenology of primary states is required to develop the case that they show characteristics that are consistent with Freudian accounts of “the unconscious” or “Id.” The reader should be made aware however, that this has been attempted before (Carhart-Harris, 2007; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). To conclude, it is perhaps not surprising that with only dreaming and psychosis at its disposal, psychoanalysis has failed to convince the scientific community that the psychoanalytic unconscious exists (Hassin et al., 2005). From a neuroscientific perspective, dreaming and psychosis are notoriously difficult to study. The occurrence of dreaming in sleep impedes experimental control and psychosis is an especially complex and variegated phenomenon. However, for those brave enough to embrace it, research with psychedelics could herald the beginning of a new scientifically informed-psychoanalysis that has the potential to influence modern psychology and psychiatry. The unique scientific value of psychedelics rests in their capacity to make consciously accessible that which is latent in the mind. This paper takes the position that mainstream psychology and psychiatry have underappreciated the depth of the human mind by neglecting schools of thought that posit the existence an unconscious mind. Indeed, psychedelics' greatest value may be as a remedy for ignorance of the unconscious mind."
8,10.1590/1516-4446-2014-1496,"The results of the present investigation demonstrate that AYA has significant and quite impressive acute antidepressive effects. Score reductions were observed in both the HAM-D and MADRS scales on D1 and D7, and these effects lasted for several days. It is noteworthy that these changes showed a profile that was very similar across volunteers, regardless of the prior level of depression, i.e., the severity of the current depressive episode. The antidepressant potential of AYA was previously demonstrated in a study that reported a decrease in hopelessness symptoms after acute AYA intake The average time necessary for the onset of therapeutic action of commercially available antidepressants is 2 weeks.3 Considering currently available medications, the fast antidepressant action of AYA is promising, as it may provide faster reductions in depressive symptoms. Moreover, the antidepressant effects of AYA alkaloids may inspire a new area of depression research. Interestingly, symptoms increased on D14 as measured by the HAM-D and MADRS scales, although a subsequent significant decrease occurred on D21 in both scales. Although increased, HAM-D scores still remained 45% below baseline values, but this difference was nonsignificant. On the other hand, MADRS scores on D14 were significantly increased The decreases and increases in depressive symptoms after AYA administration could reflect complex intracellular events that remain active after the acute effects of AYA have subsided. The acute antidepressive effects of ketamine, for instance, may be sustained for weeks to months and are associated with increased synaptogenesis and spine formation, which seem to be related with increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels.4,5 Studies conducted in rodents by our group and by others using doses of 10-15 mg/kg harmine have demonstrated antidepressive effects for this compound, which were associated with increases in BDNF levels. Furthermore, harmine, THH, and harmaline are potent natural, selective, reversible, and competitive inhibitors of the MAO enzyme, especially of the MAO-A subtype.9,36 THH acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well as an MAOI.9,37 Inhibition of both systems - MAO and serotonin reuptake - may result in elevated levels of brain serotonin and other monoamines, producing antidepressant effects. The statistically significant reductions in BPRS-AD scores from D1 to D21 suggest that AYA produced antidepressive and anxiolytic effects. A previous study reported decreased panic-related signs after acute AYA intake. AYA administration did not produce statistically significant sensory, cognitive, or affective modifications as assessed by the BPRS and YMRS scales. Although nonsignificant, in the present study these effects were observed during a period ranging from 80 to 140 min after AYA administration, which is the time point when the subjective effects of AYA are peaking, as are DMT plasma levels. The absence of statistically significant effects on BPRS-TD scores could be explained by the DMT concentration found in our AYA batch (0.08 mg/mL), which is lower than DMT doses used in previous studies that reported significant psychotropic effects of AYA (0.53 mg/mL DMT).9,12 The nonsignificant effects of AYA on the BPRS-TD subscale suggest that changes in sensory perception and thought content may not be essential for therapeutic effects. AYA was well tolerated by all patients, suggesting that it can be safely administered to depressed patients. This result corroborates previous studies reporting a good tolerability profile for AYA administration to healthy volunteers.8-12,15,25,39 In the present study, the psychoactive effects of AYA were considered by participants as mild and short-lived, corroborating the nonsignificant effect of AYA on the BPRS-TD subscale. The nonsignificant increases in blood pressure replicate previous findings in human studies suggesting that AYA produces moderate cardiovascular effects. Early academic research on classical hallucinogens was designed considering the powerful influences of set (psychological state) and setting (environment) on the effects of this class of substances.40 Considering this background, in the present study volunteers were kept as comfortable as possible, remaining seated in a recliner in a quiet, dimly lit room throughout the experimental session. Investigator interference was minimal, allowing patients to concentrate on the effects of AYA. This safe environment may have reduced the probability of dysphoric reactions Vomiting was the only adverse effect reported by volunteers (50%). Patients were informed before the experimental session that vomiting was a possible effect of AYA, as nausea and vomiting are the most frequently reported adverse effects in clinical trials of acute AYA administration.8-12,15,39 In the present study, vomiting apparently did not have a significant influence on the antidepressive effects of AYA. Patients did not consider this emetic effect to be a severe discomfort, a result that is in line with previous studies of acute AYA administration to healthy volunteers, which reported that most participants regarded their AYA experience as pleasant despite the occurrence of vomiting In future studies, it would be interesting to try to reduce the emetic effect of AYA by premedicating with an antiemetic. However, this possibility should be explored with caution, considering that AYA alkaloids could interact with antiemetic drugs. Another possibility could be to administer AYA in different formulations. Freeze-dried AYA appears to produce less vomiting than oral AYA.8,11,15,39 Interestingly, variable degrees of nausea, vomiting, and, occasionally, simultaneous diarrhea are common in AYA rituals. In these contexts, however, these purgative effects are considered positive and cleansing. Important limitations of the present open-label study include the small sample size, the absence of a systematic inquiry about side effects, and the lack of placebo and control groups. Although patients did not spontaneously report adverse effects other than vomiting, the lack of a systematic assessment of adverse effects may have reduced the likelihood of registering more subtle effects, such as impacts on cognition. Future studies should assess the possible adverse effects of AYA in clinical populations by using other subjective measures, such as visual analogue scales and other scales that measure hallucinogenic effects, and by exploring other variables that could be modified by AYA administration as reported in previous studies, such as neuropsychological, neurophysiological, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immunological parameters. Ideally, future studies involving AYA and depressed patients or other clinical populations should also be designed to include a control group. This group could receive a placebo, a comparator drug with an established therapeutic indication, or AYA preceded by pretreatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist to investigate possible mechanisms of action. Regarding the small number of patients, additional studies with larger sample sizes and using neuroimaging techniques (single photon emission tomography, SPECT) are underway in our laboratory. The aforementioned limitations should be considered taking into account the novelty of this research and its preliminary nature. To our knowledge, the use of AYA in a controlled clinical setting in patients with current depression - or in any other clinical population - has never been investigated. Moreover, the results of the present study, although preliminary, are corroborated by mounting research showing antidepressive potentials for AYA alkaloids in nonhuman animals16-24 and in humans. Finally, the reported results may prompt novel research into substances with faster therapeutic actions than currently available pharmacological resources, thus making antidepressive treatment more effective. The findings of this preliminary study demonstrate the potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of AYA, effects that, importantly, have an earlier onset of action when compared to traditional antidepressants. These findings suggest that AYA may represent a powerful new substance for the treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, these results deserve careful analysis, given the inherent limitations of an uncontrolled, open-label study with a small sample size. Other studies are needed to replicate these preliminary observations and to test, for example, the most effective dose (or doses) of AYA and the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of AYA administration over a longer period of time.",
9,10.1177/0269881117725915,"It is appropriate to acknowledge some of limitations of this review. Only two serotonin receptor subtypes have been discussed in depth and it would be wrong to dismiss the contribution of the others. For example, some relatively new antidepressants have an important (antagonist) action at 5-HT2C receptors (which has secondary faciliatory effects on DA transmission) (MacIsaac et al., 2014) and others, such as vortioxetine, have appreciable affinities for several other 5-HT receptors (Riga et al., 2016; Thase et al., 2016) – perhaps most notably, the 5-HT6 receptor (Karila et al., 2015)). Similarly, we did not address literature on functional selectivity or agonist trafficking (Berg et al., 1998; Gray and Roth, 2001; Meana, 2013) and neither have we discussed the role of heterodimers in serotonergic and particularly 5-HT2AR functioning (Gonzalez-Maeso, 2011, 2014; Gonzalez-Maeso and Sealfon, 2012), nor the role of glutamatergic mechanisms that follow 5-HT2AR signalling and how these are involved in plasticity (Aghajanian and Marek, 1999). It should also be acknowledged that much importance has been ascribed to psychedelics’ 5-HT2AR agonist properties but many of the psychedelic compounds featured also possess considerable actions at other 5-HT receptors, including the 5-HT1AR (Nichols, 2004). Although we acknowledge this limitation, we also wish to emphasise that the evidence is compelling that 5-HT2AR agonism is key to psychedelics’ most characteristic effects (Halberstadt, 2015), 5-HT1AR agonism attenuates rather than augments these effects (Pokorny et al., 2016; Strassman, 1996) and more selective 5-HT2AR agonists appear to have the same quintessential psychological effects as the less selective psychedelics (Halberstadt, 2017). We acknowledge that what is presented here is a simplified and therefore incomplete picture of brain serotonin function. This was an intentional approach (and compromise) however, as our main aim was not to produce an exhaustive review of serotonin transmission at its many receptors but rather distil it down to some key principles. We chose to focus on the 5-HT1A and 2A receptors because we felt that the functions associated with their signalling give the most comprehensive perspective of the general functioning of brain serotonin transmission. These two receptors are more implicated in the pharmacology of major psychiatric disorders than any of the other 5-HT receptor subtypes (Artigas et al., 2013b; Azmitia, 2007) – although others have highlighted the 5-HT1B receptor using a similar argument (Nautiyal and Hen, 2017) and it must be conceded that wealth of data does not necessarily imply strength of relationship. However, that the 5-HT1A and 2A receptors have opposite effects on single cell activity has long been a matter of intrigue (Araneda and Andrade, 1991). Crucially, that these receptors also seem to subserve distinct functions (Table 1) implies that the 5-HT system is not just diverse, but adaptive. We propose that the 5-HT system is specifically adaptive to the severity of adversity and whether it is better to passively tolerate it (with the assistance of 5-HT1AR signalling) or more actively respond it via a major change in perspective and/or behaviour (with the assistance of 5-HT2AR signalling). Another criticism of this paper is that it has focused too much on 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics and MDMA, rather than on classical preclinical behavioural literature and less potent serotonergic manipulations. In defence of our approach, the primacy we have given to research on psychedelics has allowed us to conceive a truly novel model of brain serotonin function. The most unique component of our model is pathway 2 (Figure 3), i.e. that 5-HT2AR signalling mediates plasticity related processes in aid of active coping. That this pathway has not previously been emphasised in models of serotonin function may have been due to a historical focus on the association between 5-HT2AR agonism and pathology and an insufficient willingness to acknowledge and endeavour to study these drugs’ complex subjective effects. We share the view of others (Grof, 1979; Heifets and Malenka, 2016) that 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics and MDMA are remarkably powerful tools for studying the human brain and mind – and their scientific and medicinal value has not yet been properly appreciated (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). We also believe that human studies with these compounds can be done safely if appropriate safeguards are heeded (Johnson et al., 2008). It could be argued that too much emphasis has been placed on extreme states in this paper that are not relevant to normal physiological conditions. Basal 5-HT2AR signalling has shown to be important for the maintenance of normal levels of cognitive flexibility (Boulougouris et al., 2008; Clarke et al., 2004, 2007) and may also account for traits such as high ‘absorption’ (Ott et al., 2005). We subscribe to the principle that challenging a system with an extreme perturbation can yield especially valuable insights about its normal functioning, by pushing it to and beyond its limits. Moreover, given that evolutionary pressures are major drivers of adaptation and change, understanding how a particular function operates during extreme conditions (e.g. when one’s life is in danger), may be particularly informative about why that function exists at all. It seems reasonable to infer that states induced by MDMA and 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics may be possible to achieve without these drugs, if only at an attenuated level. These drugs may therefore justifiably be considered ‘unveilers of function’. Note: the term ‘psychedelic’ literally means ‘mind-revealing’. Relatedly, it is intriguing to speculate that 5-HT2AR signalling may have played an important role in human evolutionary as well as ontogenetic development, perhaps through enhancing plasticity and adaptability during extreme conditions. The 5-HT2AR is densest in evolutionary recent brain regions (Beliveau et al., 2016; Erritzoe et al., 2009; Ettrup et al., 2014, 2016; Varnas et al., 2004; ). Indeed, it is readily apparent in Figure 1 that 5-HT2AR expression is especially dense in regions of the so-called default-mode network, which is associated with especially high-level psychological functions, such as self-consciousness and the ‘self’ or ‘ego’ itself (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010) as well as the acute network level effects of psychedelics, as determined by human neuroimaging studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). By body weight, humans have vastly more cortex than other species (MacLean, 1990; Molnar et al., 2014) (where 5-HT2ARs are densest (Ettrup et al., 2014)) and our remarkable adaptability is one of our most defining species traits (Anton et al., 2014) – as is our sense of self. It has been hypothesised by a popular proponent of psychedelic drug-use (Terrence McKenna) that ingestion of naturally occurring psychedelics (e.g. psilocybe mushrooms) catalysed the evolution of the human neocortex (Abraham et al., 1998). A perhaps more plausible (and less psychedelic-centric) alternative however, is that non-linearities evolved in the serotonergic system (Erritzoe et al., 2010; Jansson et al., 2001) that conferred optimal adaptability, including a capacity to switch to greater 5-HT2AR signalling when conditions demand it (such as during extreme adversity). Future work may endeavour to test the hypothesis that 5-HT2AR signalling serves an exceptional function in humans. The vastness of our 5-HT2AR dense cortex suggests that this hypothesis is worth exploring, and the development of agonist radioligands that can label the 5-HT2AR in its high affinity state may help us in this regard (Ettrup et al., 2014, 2016; Jorgensen et al., 2016). Regarding neuroimaging the psychedelic state, this is a nascent and fast-moving field and it would be beyond the scope of this article to discuss the relevant published findings in detail (this area is deserving of its own review paper). Suffice to say that an emergent principle from the various studies is that the brain is uncharacteristically ‘entropic’ in the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), reflecting a greatly heightened plasticity in which old material may be unlearned (consistent with the principles of extinction learning) and new ideas and associations learned. It might be argued (unfairly in our view) that the present contribution on the function of brain serotonin has not added anything new to previous models (Andrews et al., 2015; Azmitia, 2007; Branchi, 2011; Dayan and Huys, 2009; Deakin, 1998). We acknowledge that the model presented here has been much inspired by previous attempts to resolve this enigma but feel it also significantly advances on them and is entirely novel in its own right. It integrates findings that were inspirational for previous models but also assimilates recent and (perhaps somewhat overlooked) data on the brain and behavioural effects of potent serotonergic drugs such as MDMA and the 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics. Previous models acknowledged the role of hippocampal 5-HT1AR signalling in resilience (Deakin, 2013; Deakin and Graeff, 1991) but we have significantly extended on this by our thorough coverage of 5-HT2AR functioning and its mediation of plasticity in aid of optimal adaptability. Regarding specific past contributions, we acknowledge the work of Deakin and Graeff (Deakin, 2013; Deakin and Graeff, 1991) and others (Cools et al., 2008; Crockett et al., 2009; Wise et al., 1970) concerning the role of 5-HT in aversive processing, plus the increasingly compelling work on serotonin’s role in promoting patience (Fonseca et al., 2015; Miyazaki et al., 2012, 2014) and collectively relate these to our hypothesis that postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling mediates passive coping in response to adversity. It is worth commenting on a nuance here: in Deakin and Graeff’s model, 5-HT1AR signalling is linked to chronic adversity – which we do not dispute; however, we would argue that 5-HT2AR signalling becomes increasingly relevant as the severity of adversity reaches a critical point. Indeed, we have emphasised the importance of the severity of adversity in our model – but it may be worthwhile to also consider the role of the chronicity of adversity in determining the differential engagement of 5-HT receptor subtypes (Cohen et al., 2015; Dayan and Huys, 2009). We also acknowledge the increasingly appealing perspectives of Branchi (2011), Belsky et al. (2009) and others (Homberg, 2012) concerning serotonin and plasticity, and relate this to our hypothesis that 5-HT2AR signalling mediates plasticity in aid of optimal adaptability. We acknowledge Andrew et al.’s hypothesis of serotonin mediating an adaptive homeostasis (Andrews et al., 2015) (see also Hale et al. (2013)) and believe this could be broadly related to our bipartite model. However, we feel our model is more psychologically focused, receptor specific, and consistent with the classical view that enhanced 5-HT transmission (within certain bounds and contexts) is conducive to positive mood. Perspectives such as Andrews and colleagues (2015) that challenge this view, cite, among other things, the relationship between punishment, 5-HT release and depression – to endorse the perspective that serotonergic functioning is elevated in depression (Barton et al., 2008)). Consistent with the classical (Wise et al., 1970) and arguably still dominant perspective (Cowen and Browning, 2015) however, our view is that increased 5-HT release in response to adversity is functional rather than pathological, serving to moderate stress via postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling, and in extreme cases, initiate a rapid plasticity in the service of major change – via 5-HT2AR signalling.","This paper has sought to address a major unresolved problem in neuropsychopharmacology, namely what is the function of brain serotonin? It proposes that the principal function of brain serotonin is to enhance adaptive responses to adverse conditions via two distinct pathways: (1) a passive coping pathway which improves stress tolerability; and (2) an active coping pathway associated with heightened plasticity, which, with support, can improve an organism’s ability to identify and overcome source(s) of stress by changing outlook and/or behaviour. Crucially, we propose that these two functions are mediated by signalling at postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors respectively, with 5-HT1AR signalling dominating under ordinary conditions but 5-HT2AR signalling becoming increasingly operative as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We suggest that the two functions of interest (5-HT1AR-mediated stress relief and 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity) are sufficiently distinct – and may even be mutually oppositional in certain contexts (see also Azmitia, 2001), evoking dilemmas over whether it is better to passively endure or actively approach, and in so doing, initiate some sort of fundamental change – with the potential for major resolution. This rule may not be absolute however, and the two functions may also be complementary, e.g. in the case of enhanced serotonin functioning with chronic SSRI use – or indeed with normal basal 5-HT functioning, facilitating improved endurance and plasticity (Clarke et al., 2004, 2007; Mithoefer et al., 2011, 2016; van Apeldoorn et al., 2008) Despite this complementarity, we do anticipate that conventional serotonergic antidepressants such as the SSRIs and classic psychedelics such as psilocybin may become competitive options for the treatments of certain disorders such as depression; most fundamentally because they work via distinct pathways (i.e. 5-HT1AR versus the 5-HT2AR signalling) – but also because they cannot easily be taken in combination, i.e. conventional antidepressants attenuate the characteristic psychological effects of psychedelics (Bonson et al., 1996; Bonson and Murphy, 1996). SSRIs are established evidence-based treatments for anxiety and major depression (Baldwin et al., 2016; Hieronymus et al., 2016), whereas psychedelics are experimental medicines in an early phase of development (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). However, if evidence supporting the therapeutic value of psychedelics accrues – as we anticipate, and it is increasingly shown that their therapeutic mechanisms are significantly distinct from those of conventional medications, then this will open-up new and potentially empowering options for patients and clinicians (as well as a real potential for resistance – however it may arise). For the brave new psychiatry of the future – that many would like to see (Miller, 2010) – decisions about whether to passively endure or actively address, may become increasingly pertinent."
10,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.022,"Classical serotonergic psychedelics are known to cause changes in mood (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011) and brain function (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017) that persist long after the acute effects of the drugs have subsided. Moreover, several psychedelics elevate glutamate levels in the cortex (Nichols, 2004, Nichols, 2016) and increase gene expression in vivo of the neurotrophin BDNF as well as immediate-early genes associated with plasticity (Martin et al., 2014, Nichols and Sanders-Bush, 2002, Vaidya et al., 1997). This indirect evidence has led to the reasonable hypothesis that psychedelics promote structural and functional neural plasticity, although this assumption had never been rigorously tested (Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). The data presented here provide direct evidence for this hypothesis, demonstrating that psychedelics cause both structural and functional changes in cortical neurons Prior to this study, two reports suggested that psychedelics might be able to produce changes in neuronal structure. Jones et al. (2009) demonstrated that DOI was capable of transiently increasing the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, but no change in spine density was observed. The second study showed that DOI promoted neurite extension in a cell line of neuronal lineage (Marinova et al., 2017). Both of these reports utilized DOI, a psychedelic of the amphetamine class. Here we demonstrate that the ability to change neuronal structure is not a unique property of amphetamines like DOI because psychedelics from the ergoline, tryptamine, and iboga classes of compounds also promote structural plasticity. Additionally, D-amphetamine does not increase the complexity of cortical dendritic arbors in culture, and therefore, these morphological changes cannot be simply attributed to an increase in monoamine neurotransmission The identification of psychoplastogens belonging to distinct chemical families is an important aspect of this work because it suggests that ketamine is not unique in its ability to promote structural and functional plasticity. In addition to ketamine, the prototypical psychoplastogen, only a relatively small number of plasticity-promoting small molecules have been identified previously. Such compounds include the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ligand GLYX-13 (i.e., rapastinel), the mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495, the TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF, and the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (Lepack et al., 2016, Castello et al., 2014, Zeng et al., 2012, Voleti et al., 2013). We observe that hallucinogens from four distinct structural classes (i.e., tryptamine, amphetamine, ergoline, and iboga) are also potent psychoplastogens, providing additional lead scaffolds for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at identifying neurotherapeutics. Furthermore, our cellular assays revealed that several of these compounds were more efficacious (e.g., MDMA) or more potent (e.g., LSD) than ketamine. In fact, the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics and entactogens rivaled that of BDNF (Figures 3A–3C and S3). The extreme potency of LSD in particular might be due to slow off kinetics, as recently proposed following the disclosure of the LSD-bound 5-HT2B crystal structure (Wacker et al., 2017) Importantly, the psychoplastogenic effects of psychedelics in cortical cultures were also observed in vivo using both vertebrate and invertebrate models, demonstrating that they act through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Furthermore, the concentrations of psychedelics utilized in our in vitro cell culture assays were consistent with those reached in the brain following systemic administration of therapeutic doses in rodents (Yang et al., 2018, Cohen and Vogel, 1972). This suggests that neuritogenesis, spinogenesis, and/or synaptogenesis assays performed using cortical cultures might have value for identifying psychoplastogens and fast-acting antidepressants. It should be noted that our structural plasticity studies performed in vitro utilized neurons exposed to psychedelics for extended periods of time. Because brain exposure to these compounds is often of short duration due to rapid metabolism, it will be interesting to assess the kinetics of psychedelic-induced plasticity A key question in the field of psychedelic medicine has been whether or not psychedelics promote changes in the density of dendritic spines (Kyzar et al., 2017). Using super-resolution SIM, we clearly demonstrate that psychedelics do, in fact, increase the density of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, an effect that is not restricted to a particular structural class of compounds. Using DMT, we verified that cortical neuron spine density increases in vivo and that these changes in structural plasticity are accompanied by functional effects such as increased amplitude and frequency of spontaneous EPSCs. We specifically designed these experiments to mimic previous studies of ketamine (Li et al., 2010) so that we might directly compare these two compounds, and, to a first approximation, they appear to be remarkably similar. Not only do they both increase spine density and neuronal excitability in the cortex, they seem to have similar behavioral effects. We have shown previously that, like ketamine, DMT promotes fear extinction learning and has antidepressant effects in the forced swim test (Cameron et al., 2018). These results, coupled with the fact that ayahuasca, a DMT-containing concoction, has potent antidepressant effects in humans (Osório et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016, Santos et al., 2007), suggests that classical psychedelics and ketamine might share a related therapeutic mechanism. Although the molecular targets of ketamine and psychedelics are different (NMDA and 5-HT2A receptors, respectively), they appear to cause similar downstream effects on structural plasticity by activating mTOR. This finding is significant because ketamine is known to be addictive whereas many classical psychedelics are not (Nutt et al., 2007, Nutt et al., 2010). The exact mechanisms by which these compounds stimulate mTOR is still not entirely understood, but our data suggest that, at least for classical psychedelics, TrkB and 5-HT2A receptors are involved. Although most classical psychedelics are not considered to be addictive, there are still significant safety concerns with their use in medicine because they cause profound perceptual disturbances and still have the potential to be abused. Therefore, the identification of non-hallucinogenic analogs capable of promoting plasticity in the PFC could facilitate a paradigm shift in our approach to treating neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, such compounds could be critical to resolving the long-standing debate in the field concerning whether the subjective effects of psychedelics are necessary for their therapeutic effects (Majić et al., 2015). Although our group is actively investigating the psychoplastogenic properties of non-hallucinogenic analogs of psychedelics, others have reported the therapeutic potential of safer structural and functional analogs of ketamine (Moskal et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2015, Zanos et al., 2016). Our data demonstrate that classical psychedelics from several distinct chemical classes are capable of robustly promoting the growth of both neurites and dendritic spines in vitro, in vivo, and across species. Importantly, our studies highlight the similarities between the effects of ketamine and those of classical serotonergic psychedelics, supporting the hypothesis that the clinical antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of these molecules might result from their ability to promote structural and functional plasticity in prefrontal cortical neurons. We have demonstrated that the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics require TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A signaling, suggesting that these key signaling hubs may serve as potential targets for the development of psychoplastogens, fast-acting antidepressants, and anxiolytics. Taken together, our results suggest that psychedelics may be used as lead structures to identify next-generation neurotherapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles.",
11,10.1007/s00213-017-4771-x,"This paper presents updated and extended data from an open-label clinical trial assessing psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression. Findings corroborate our (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016) and others’ previous results (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016; Grob et al. 2011) supporting the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for depressive and anxiety symptoms. A fast and sustained response exceeding what might be expected from a placebo response was observed in many of the patients (see Carhart-Harris and Nutt (2016) for a relevant discussion). Notably, all 19 completers showed some reductions in the QIDS-SR16 scores at 1-week post-treatment and (nominally) maximal effects were seen at 5 weeks. Other interventions, not formally part of the present trial, confounded outcomes at 3 and 6 months, although safety was maintained and a sizeable proportion of the sample continued to demonstrate benefit (see Watts et al. (2017) for more details). Conclusions on efficacy are limited by the absence of a control condition in this trial, however. Recent studies (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016; Carhart-Harris et al. 2016), including the present one, help demonstrate the feasibility of treating patients with major depressive disorder with psilocybin plus psychological support. Two recent double-blind randomised control trials (RCTs) of psilocybin for depression and anxiety symptoms in a combined sample of 80 patients with life-threatening cancer found consistent safety and efficacy outcomes with those reported here (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016). Only a subset of patients recruited into these studies met the criteria for major depressive disorder however, and symptoms were not of the same severity as those seen here (i.e. mean baseline BDI scores were 18.1 and 16 in the Griffiths et al. and Ross et al. studies, respectively, whereas they were 35 in the present study). A comprehensive RCT designed to properly assess psilocybin’s efficacy for major depressive disorder, with some form of placebo control, is therefore warranted (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Regarding mechanisms, we recently proposed a model by which psychedelic-induced 5-HT2AR signalling rapidly induces an acute state of plasticity in which an enriched context (Carhart-Harris et al., in review) may lead to cognitive biases being revised (Carhart-Harris and Nutt 2017; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017)—see also Branchi (2011). The above-reported correlation between acute ‘insightfulness’ and enduring reductions in depressive symptoms may be viewed as broadly supportive of this model. Moreover, recently published fMRI data collected as part of the present trial may help to develop and refine this model (Roseman et al., in review; Carhart-Harris et al., in review). Future research should endeavour to better characterise, control and measure the various psychological components contained within the current psychedelic treatment model. There is an assumption that individuals under the influence of a psychedelic are especially sensitive to the context in which the experience occurs, both in terms of (1) prior expectations and other relevant state and trait factors and (2) environmental factors, e.g. the quality of the relationships with persons attending to them before, during and after the experience and patients’ relationship to the music listened to during the sessions (Kaelen et al. 2015)—and this matter has recently been discussed in length (Carhart-Harris et al., in review). In order to properly assess the relative contribution of these variables and their assumed interactions with psilocybin, it will be necessary to properly control and measure them, and this has presently not yet been done to a satisfactory level (see Carhart-Harris et al. (in review) for suggestions on how this might be done). Relatedly, psychotherapeutic models used to support and mediate the psilocybin experience need to be better defined, tested and potentially manualised. Basic principles for safe therapeutic work with psychedelics can be found in guidelines (Johnson et al. 2008) and books (Richards 2015) but more systematic verification, refinement and (eventual) manualisation of treatment approaches are needed for subsequent roll-out (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Moreover, cost-effectiveness will become increasingly salient as the development of psilocybin as a treatment model progresses. The major qualifier here is that experiments intended to evaluate the contribution of psychological variables to the psychedelic experience need to be conceived and conducted with an appreciation of the special vulnerability of individuals under the influence of psychedelics (again, see Carhart-Harris et al. (in review). Thus, certain standards of care, including a certain level of psychological support, may be non-negotiable if safety is to be maintained. An obvious limitation of the present study is its open-label design and absence of a control condition. The initial plan was to conduct a placebo-controlled RCT but regulatory and drug procurement challenges meant that available resources could only support a smaller trial. The present results may be viewed as a successful demonstration of proof-of-principle, however, supporting the view that psilocybin can be given safely, even in severe cases of depression, with the caveat that appropriate control of context (e.g. the provision of psychological support and a comfortable environment) is essential for positive outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., in review). Impressions of efficacy gleaned from the present study’s findings may be cautiously described as ‘promising’—and if supported by larger and better controlled trials, psilocybin’s low toxicity, favourable side effect profile and putative rapid and enduring antidepressant action could render it at least competitive with currently available treatments for major depression, whose therapeutic actions may be either delayed, e.g. in the cases of SSRIs and psychotherapy, or short-lived, e.g. in the case of ketamine. Comparative efficacy trials may therefore be an interesting next step. Such designs may also have merit in terms of addressing the challenge of maintaining the study blind in trials with psychedelics (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Another limitation of the present trial is that the final eight patients were all male. This is regretful as it limits extrapolation to the general population, where rates of treatment-resistant depression may be marginally higher in women than in men (Kubitz et al. 2013). Greater effort will be made in future trials to recruit more representative samples of the target population. Another limitation deserving of mention is the issue of assessing duration of current depressive episode. Patients gave estimates based on the question “For how long has your current depression lasted?” but some chose to estimate based on the duration of their chronic illness, believing they had not experienced a discernable remission for years–decades, even during periods when their symptoms were relatively less severe. In summary, we have presented updated and extended data from a feasibility trial assessing psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression. With the caveat that this was an open-label trial with no control condition, safety and efficacy outcomes continue to support the case for further research (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Identifying key psychological and pharmacological variables comprising the treatment model, and testing their assumed interactions, is one of a number of important next steps (Carhart-Harris et al., in review).",
12,10.1097/JCP.0000000000000436,"Administration of ayahuasca was associated with rapid and sustained antidepressive effects. Results were similar across volunteers, regardless of the severity of the current depressive episode. Ayahuasca administration was also associated with increased blood perfusion in the nucleus accumbens, insula, and subgenual area, brain regions involved in the regulation of mood and emotional states. Significant score decreases in HAM-D, MADRS, and Anxious-Depression BPRS subscale scores were observed during acute drug effects and from D1 to D21 and were related to depressed mood, sadness, anxiety, feelings of guilt, suicidal ideation, difficulties at work/activities, pessimistic thinking, and difficulty concentrating. Improvements in emotional withdrawal and blunted affect were (Thinking Disorder and Withdrawal-Retardation BPRS subscales) were also observed. Ayahuasca induced significant score increases in the CADSS scale at 40 to 80 minutes, suggesting increased psychoactivity in the same time point previously associated with peak ayahuasca psychoactive effects and DMT plasma levels.1–3 No significant changes in YMRS and Activation BPRS subscale scores were observed after ayahuasca intake, suggesting an absence of maniac-like effects. However, it is important to note that in our study a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and a previous history of mania or hypomania induced by antidepressant or substance use were considered exclusion criteria. Ayahuasca may be contraindicated for bipolar disorders patients, since a recent case report described a man with bipolar disorder that developed a manic episode after ayahuasca consumption.12 Increased blood perfusion in the subgenual area, nucleus accumbens, and insula were observed after ayahuasca intake. Hypoactivation of these brain regions is usually associated with depression, while increased activation is usually associated with antidepressive effects.13–17 Interestingly, ayahuasca increased blood perfusion in the anterior insula of healthy volunteers, but no significant changes were observed in the subgenual area or nucleus accumbens.3 These data suggest that our results may be specific to depressive patients. The potential antidepressant effects of ayahuasca appear to be mediated by the agonist action of DMT on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors, since agonists of these receptors produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects.18,19 Indeed, administration of DMT and other 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists such as psilocybin and LSD is associated with increases in positive mood in healthy volunteers20–22 and in patients suffering life-threatening diseases.23,24 Functional alterations in the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain regions associated with self-perception, could also mediate the observed effects. Rumination, a core depressive symptom, is associated with increased DMN activity, and ayahuasca25 and psilocybin26 may reduce this activity.25 Theoretically, by changing one’s self-perception, hallucinogens may reduce excessive attention to repetitive and pathological thoughts.1,25,26 Interestingly, decreases in brain blood flow observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies25,26 are inconsistent with our results and previous SPECT/positron emission tomography (PET) studies.1,3,27 These discrepancies may be related to different timescales involved in fMRI and SPECT/PET studies, which use radiotracers with long half-lives. Thus, phasic or short-term decreases in blood flow measured with fMRI may show some rebound effects and longer-term changes that are detected by SPECT/PET.26 Ayahuasca was well tolerated. No significant cardiovascular effects were observed after ayahuasca intake, and vomiting was the only adverse effect recorded. However, patients did not consider vomiting as causing severe discomfort. Moreover, ayahuasca psychoactive effects were considered mild and short-lived, and no dysphoric effects were reported. Indeed, volunteers were calm and relaxed under the effects of ayahuasca, considering it as a pleasant experience. Although described results are promising, because treatment was not randomized or double-blind, and there was no placebo or other comparator group, we cannot conclude that the observed changes were in fact caused by ayahuasca. Moreover, it is important to note that the controlled clinical setting in which the experiments took place is different from the typical ritual context of ayahuasca consumption, which may impact the generalizability of our findings.6,28 Our results should be replicated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, and future research should investigate whether or how a ceremonial/ritual context may impact therapeutic outcomes.",
13,10.3389/fphar.2013.00161,"The development of ketamine as a rapidly acting antidepressant drug has the potential to revolutionize clinical treatment. Nevertheless, the clinical use of ketamine for depression poses a number of challenges. Ketamine is an hallucinogenic drug subject to abuse and must be given in a controlled setting. The effects of ketamine are short-lasting and can only be sustained by its repeated treatment. A desirable research direction would be to develop other drugs with similar antidepressant effects that are devoid of ketamine's liabilities. However, progress in this area is constrained by uncertainty concerning the critical pharmacological mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Animal models have the potential to translate the pharmacological effects of ketamine that are most critical for its clinical antidepressant effects. A substantial body of literature now indicates that ketamine produces antidepressant-like effects in preclinical tests for antidepressant activity and in animal models of depression. Acute ketamine produces immediate effects on many behavioral tests that are similar to antidepressants. However, the protracted effects of ketamine measured for days after a single administration are not produced by conventional antidepressants. They define a new paradigm for antidepressant drug discovery that is the best temporal correlate with ketamine's clinical activity. Inconsistent findings across laboratories may arise from a disparity in methodology used across studies. The most pertinent variables are that the efficacious dose is dependent on the behavioral task employed, conditions surrounding administration and the time of testing post-administration of ketamine. For example, evidence suggests that the effects of low and seemingly sub-efficacious doses of ketamine are more effective following stress exposure. Behavioral tests with high predictive validity for antidepressant-like effects, such as the FST, are sensitive to acute and chronic ketamine. They can be utilized in conjunction with other tests sensitive only to chronic antidepressant treatment, such as the NSF/SPT, to measure the protracted benefits that are unique to ketamine. Overall, combination of a stress or genetic model of depression/anxiety with behavioral assessment over a 1–2 week period post-treatment with low doses of ketamine will yield the most valid and useful information. Among the many barriers to translation of ketamine's clinical antidepressant effects across species stand a number of key pharmacological factors. The route of administration of ketamine in preclinical models is by i.p. injection, whereas intravenous infusion is usually employed in clinical trials. Therefore, it may be beneficial for animal studies to employ intravenous infusion where practical. In addition, plasma levels of ketamine monitored in the first 2 h following administration can determine whether the dose/route of administration of ketamine produces comparable bioavailability across species. Given that the half-life of ketamine is short, differing levels of ketamine may account for some variation in the behavioral tests. However, ketamine is no longer present when protracted behavioral effects are measured days after administration. These protracted changes result from rapid and sustained molecular alterations induced following a single treatment with ketamine. In addition, the preservative benzethonium chloride (BCl) is universally used in ketamine preparations both for clinical and preclinical use. Although present in low concentrations, BCl can act synergistically with ketamine to inhibit muscarinic and α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Durieux and Nietgen, 1997; Coates and Flood, 2001). The extent to which the additive properties of BCl on ketamine-induced modulation of the cholinergic system may affect the antidepressant-like response to ketamine is unknown. In the present review, there was no systematic evidence that positive or negative findings were associated with the source of ketamine in the behavioral studies examined here The mechanisms underlying ketamine's effects, the simultaneous blockade of NMDA receptors and activation of AMPA receptors, are integral for the induction of the antidepressant response. The long-term consequences of these molecular alterations are likely to mediate ketamine's protracted antidepressant-like effects mediated via increased synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival and maturation. These changes occur within hours of ketamine administration and occur in parallel with both the rapid and protracted behavioral effects in animal models of depression. The rapid modulation of mTOR, its downstream mediators, such as Akt and ERK, and BDNF represent markers of the molecular correlates of the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its ability to modify synaptic plasticity. Novel therapeutics for TRD are likely to modulate these markers in a similar temporal pattern to that of ketamine and can be used to identify better pharmaceutical agents to treat TRD.",
14,10.3389/fphar.2017.00974,"Consistent with our prior hypothesis, psilocybin-induced high OBN (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and low DED (similar to anxiety) predicted positive long-term clinical outcomes in a clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD. This result replicates those of previous studies showing that psychedelic-induced peak or mystical-type experiences are predictive of positive long-term outcomes (O'Reilly and Funk, 1964; Klavetter and Mogar, 1967; Pahnke et al., 1970; Kurland et al., 1972; Richards et al., 1977; Maclean et al., 2011; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). This relationship appears to be somewhat specific, in that OBN was significantly more predictive of positive clinical outcomes than altered visual and auditory perception—endorsing the moniker “psychedelic” (“mind-revealing”) over “hallucinogen” when referring to this class of drug—at least in the context of psychedelic therapy. It also suggests that the therapeutic effects of psilocybin are not a simple product of isolated pharmacological action but rather are experience dependent. We also found that greater DED (anxiety and impaired cognition) experienced during the drug session was predictive of less positive clinical outcomes. One may naturally infer from these findings that the occurrence of OBN or mystical-type experience mediates long-term positive clinical outcomes (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016) and while this assumption may be valid, we must exercise caution about ascribing too much to this relationship. It remains possible that as yet unmeasured and therefore unaccounted for components of psychedelic therapy play important roles in mediating long-term outcomes. There are several candidate factors in this regard, and the following should not be considered an exhaustive list: emotional insight/breakthrough or catharsis; priming and suggestibility; reliving of trauma/defining life events; insights about the self and relationships; the patients relationship to music heard; his/her success at “letting go”; the quality of therapeutic relationship; and the degree of “closure” attained during post-drug integration work These factors may exert influence before, during and after the acute experience itself and may also be more or less dependent on particular psychological frameworks and their relevant vocabularies. For example, the psychoanalytic models of Freud and Jung were dominant in psychiatry in the mid-twentieth century and thus references to ego, repression and the unconscious are commonplace among the psychedelic research literature of this period. While the processes that underlie these constructs may indeed be operative in the context of psychedelics, little effort has been made to define, measure and quantify their contributions (Shagass and Bittle, 1967; Barr et al., 1972). The development of subjective (Nour et al., 2016), behavioral and biological measures (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2016b; Lebedev et al., 2015; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016) relevant to these constructs, and more importantly, the processes that underlie them, would represent an important advance not just for psychedelic science but for the psychological frameworks themselves (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). We should be conscious of not being too attached (or averse) to any specific theoretical frameworks however, and approaches that endeavor to access “framework-free” descriptions of phenomena may prove particularly useful in this regard (Varela, 1996; Petitmengin, 2006). Critically, it is our view that it is possible to work toward a secular, biologically-informed account of the mystical-type experience that does not resort to “explaining away” or “reducing down” the core phenomenology and depth psychology may be a useful bedfellow in this regard. Returning to the present study's main findings, DED was found to negatively correlate with clinical outcome, yet, none of the patients showed a worsening of clinical symptoms at 5 weeks. Less DED combined with high OBN predicted 54% of the variance of clinical change at 5 weeks—a substantial contribution and one that helps justify the emphasis placed on minimizing anxiety and relinquishing psychological resistance in psychedelic therapy (Eisner and Cohen, 1958; Sherwood et al., 1962; Grof et al., 2008; Richards, 2015), as well as paying careful attention to preparation and “set and setting” (Hartogsohn, 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., in press). That anxiety arises in parallel with psychological struggle is resonant with principles of psychoanalytic theory (Sandison, 1961), as can be seen in the choice of terms for the “DED” and “OBN” factors of the ASC—both of which invoke constructs that can be traced to Freud (1929, 1962). According to psychoanalytic theory, the overcoming of psychological resistance is required for emotional breakthrough and insight (Freud, 1920) and the occurrence of mystical-type/peak experiences (Jung, 2014). Consistently, writers on the mystical-type/peak experience have reliably identified loss of self or “ego-dissolution” as one of its basic pre-requisites and features (James, 1902; Stace, 1960; Maslow, 1964). Recent work has sought to develop and validate a measure that is sensitive to difficult or challenging psychedelic experiences (Barrett et al., 2016; Carbonaro et al., 2016) and there is some evidence that the intensity of such experiences is predictive of positive long-term outcomes, whereas the duration of struggle is predictive of negative outcomes (Carbonaro et al., 2016). This is presumably because the successful resolution of conflict brings with it, insight and relief, whereas the failure to breakthrough perpetuates suffering. ASC and other questionnaires such as the challenging experience questionnaire (CEQ) (Barrett et al., 2016) may be insensitive to whether or not successful resolution of psychological conflict has occurred. Therefore, the development of new scales specifically designed to focus on emotional breakthrough after struggle may add considerable value. Improving our subjective measures of high-level human experiences such as the mystical-type/peak experience will enhance our ability to understand their psychology and underlying neural substrates. As touched on in the introduction, psychopharmacology is increasingly acknowledging the importance of “context” and particularly “environment” as a factor mediating the effects of both intrinsic neurobiological features (e.g., genotypes) and exogenous pharmacological inputs—such as drugs (Alexander et al., 1981; Caspi et al., 2010). For example, a recent popular model of the action of SSRIs incorporates “environment” and cognitive (re)appraisal (Harmer et al., 2017) as key determinants of therapeutic efficacy (see also Branchi, 2011; Belsky, 2016). Like SSRIs, classic psychedelic drugs also work on the serotonin system; however, unlike the SSRIs, they are direct agonists at the 5-HT2A receptor (Nichols, 2016). There is compelling evidence that the 5-HT2A receptor is psychedelics' key site of action (Nichols, 2016). Intriguingly, recent work has found that the phenotypic expression of 5-HT2AR genotypes is significantly dependent on the influence of “environment” (Jokela et al., 2007). These findings may imply that enhanced sensitivity to context is an important function of 5-HT2A receptor signaling (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017). Ascending from the pharmacological to the whole-brain systems level, increased cortical entropy has been found to be a reliable feature of the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), to relate to high-level subjective experiences such as “ego-dissolution” (Nour et al., 2016; Atasoy et al., 2017; Schartner et al., 2017) that are relevant to the mystical-type experience, and to be predictive of longer-term trait changes—such as increased “openness” (Lebedev et al., 2016). Recent work suggests that increased brain entropy under psychedelics is consistent with the brain being more closely tuned to “criticality” (Atasoy et al., 2017). Criticality refers to systems that reside in a functional “sweet spot”, critically poised between order and disorder—in which they can effectively retain information (by being sufficiently ordered) while being appropriately adaptive and sensitive to change (by being sufficiently disordered). Intriguingly, one of the signatures of a critical system is a sensitivity to perturbation (Bak, 1996). It follows that enhanced sensitivity to perturbation in a psychedelically-induced “entropic” and “critical” brain may account for the special sensitivity to “environment” that is characteristic of the psychedelic state (Hartogsohn, 2016; Carhart-Harris et al., in press). Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of OBN, mystical-type or peak experiences (Vollenweider, 2001) should enable us to better comprehend, define and study them. This is important, not least because they are proving to be important determinants of treatment success in psychedelic therapy (Richards et al., 1977; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). Crucially, better understanding the biological basis of mystical-type/peak experiences and their longer-term impact on the mind and brain should help to demystify them, facilitating an easier conversation about them with mainstream psychology. Researchers in the mainstream have as much a responsibility as those in “the periphery” to facilitate this. Denying the relevance of these phenomena is as damaging to scientific progress as denying their physical basis. The prize for successfully integrating mystical-type experience into mainstream science may be their potential to have a substantial positive impact on medicine, education and society—which ironically, may, at least in part, explain why their integration into western society has proved so difficult to achieve (Stevens, 1987). To summarize, the occurrence of high OBN (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and low DED (relating to anxiety and impaired cognition) under psilocybin predicted positive clinical outcomes in a trial of psilocybin for TRD. This relationship exhibited a degree of specificity, in that psilocybin-induced OBN was significantly more predictive of reduced depressive symptoms than the drug's more generic visual and auditory perceptual effects. Future work, with a larger sample size, is required to more comprehensively and systematically measure the influence of different potential predictive factors on the quality of acute psychedelic experiences (Gasser et al., 2014; Belser et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2017) and subsequent long-term outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., in press). As psychedelic therapy gains influence and credibility (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017), it seems vital that appropriate consideration is paid to the importance of promoting a certain kind of experience, as the quality of that experience may be the critical determinant of therapeutic success.",
15,10.1038/s41598-017-13282-7,"The present study goes some way to addressing an important knowledge gap concerning the post-acute brain effects of serotonergic psychedelics. Its findings suggest that changes in brain activity observed just one-day after a high dose psychedelic experience are very different to those found during the acute psychedelic state. Specifically, whereas the acute psychedelic state in healthy volunteers is characterised by modular disintegration14,15,28 and global integration14,19,29, there are trends towards modular (re)integration and minimal effects on global integration/segregation post psilocybin for depression. Relating the blood flow findings to what has been seen previously in the acute psychedelic state is somewhat more complicated due to inconsistencies in this literature – likely due to analysis approaches and interpretation14,15,30: Here we saw decreased CBF bilaterally in the temporal lobes, including the left amygdala one-day post treatment. Decreased absolute CBF in subcortical and high-level association cortices have been previously reported with intravenous (I.V.)15 and now oral psilocybin30 but increased CBF and metabolism have also been reported with I.V. LSD14, oral psilocybin31, and oral ayahuasca Much recent research has focused on the involvement of the default-mode network in psychiatric disorders33, and particularly depression34,35. We previously observed decreased DMN functional integrity under psilocybin15 and LSD14, and others have with ayahuasca28. Here however, increased DMN integrity was observed one-day post treatment with psilocybin, both via seed (i.e. vmPFC and sgACC) and network-based approaches. Previous work has suggested that increased DMN integrity may be a marker of depressed mood and specifically, depressive rumination34,36. On this basis, increased DMN integrity post psilocybin may be surprising. The post-treatment increases in within-DMN RSFC and sgACC-PCC RSFC did not relate to symptom improvements but vmPFC-ilPC RSFC did (see Fig. 3). This apparent divergence from previous findings36,37 is intriguing, and deserves further discussion (below) It should be noted that findings of elevated within-DMN RSFC in depression are not entirely consistent in the literature38,39,40,41. For example, using a DMN-focused analysis, precuneus-DMN RSFC39 was found to be lower in patients than in healthy controls, and normalised after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - and only in responders39 – consistent with the present findings. Lower precuneus-DMN RSFC in depression was also seen in a separate study and the degree of this abnormality correlated with autobiographical memory deficits40. In another study, lower PCC-dmPFC and PCC-ilPC RSFC were seen in first-episode depressed patients relative to healthy controls41. In the present study, we saw increased within-DMN RSFC post treatment with psilocybin, and increased vmPFC-bilateral ilPC RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5 weeks (Fig. 3). These findings suggest a commonality in the antidepressant action of ECT and psilocybin39 in which DMN integrity is decreased acutely (at least by the latter14,15,28) and increased (or normalised) post-acutely, accompanied by improvements in mood. This process might be likened to a ‘reset’ mechanism in which acute modular disintegration (e.g. in the DMN) enables a subsequent re-integration and resumption of normal functioning Recent meta-analyses of studies of resting-state CBF in depression have yielded relatively mixed results34,42, although findings of increased thalamic34,42 and sgACC metabolism are relatively consistent34. Here, we did not find any post-treatment changes in thalamic or sgACC CBF with psilocybin, either in whole-brain or ROI-based analyses. We did observe decreased CBF bilaterally in the temporal cortex however, including the left medial temporal lobe and specifically, the left amygdala. Given previous findings of elevated resting-state amygdala CBF and metabolism in mood disorders25,43,44, the reduction in amygdala CBF observed here, and its relation to symptom severity, could be viewed as a possible remediation effect. Moreover, generalised decreases in CBF are (again) consistent with what has been previously reported with ECT45, i.e. most studies have documented an increase in CBF in the acute ‘ictal’ state, including in the amygdala45; however, the post-ictal period is characterised by decreased CBF, and often in those regions that were most perfused during seizure45. Acutely increased CBF has previously been reported with ayahuasca32 and LSD15 and increased glucose metabolism has been observed in the acute state with oral31 but not I.V. psilocybin15. Thus, a post-acute reversal of acute increases in CBF could be seen as consistent with the post-treatment ‘reset’ mechanism proposed above – although recent work has laid into question whether oral psilocybin does indeed cause increases in brain absolute CBF30. It would be challenging (but not impossible) to carry out acute and post-acute imaging in future trials of psilocybin for depression, and this may be necessary if the ‘reset’ model is to be properly tested. In such a study, we would advise focusing on BOLD RSFC (and perhaps simultaneous EEG-related measures) rather than CBF, due to RSFC and EEG offering more direct and reliable indices of brain activity and function than more difficult to interpret measures such as CBF. The inclusion of a healthy control group, exposed to a consistent treatment procedure, would further strengthen the design of such a study, as would the inclusion of a placebo and/or active comparator arm The present study’s other major positive finding was a decrease in RSFC between the bilateral parahippocampus and the PFC, an effect that (like increased vmPFC-ilPC RSFC) was predictive of treatment response at 5 weeks. Curiously, a post-hoc exploratory analysis suggested that acute ‘peak’ or ‘mystical-type’ experiences under psilocybin may mediate the post-acute changes in parahippocampal RSFC (including decreased PH-PCC RSFC). Focusing on parahippocampal-PFC RSFC, this has generally been found to be elevated in depression46, and consistently so across the duration of a resting-state scan47. Prefrontal-limbic circuitry has been linked with top-down suppression of affective responsiveness48 and lower resting-state amygdala-vmPFC RSFC in combination with amygdala hyperfusion was found to relate to state-anxiety in healthy individuals43, corroborating separate findings49. Seven days of citalopram has been found to reduce amygdala-vmPFC50 and dorso-medial PFC-left hippocampal RSFC51 in healthy volunteers, somewhat consistent with the present findings In conclusion, here we document for the first time, changes in resting-state brain blood flow and functional connectivity post-treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Decreased blood flow was found to correlate (in the amygdala) with reductions in depressive mood. Increased within-DMN RSFC was observed post-treatment, using both seed and network-based analyses, and specific increases in RSFC between the vmPFC and bilateral ilPC nodes of the DMN were greatest in individuals who maintained treatment-response at 5 weeks. Finally, decreased PH-PFC RSFC was observed post-treatment and this was also predictive of treatment-response at 5 weeks. An exploratory post-hoc analysis revealed that acute ‘peak’ or ‘mystical’ experience during the high-dose psilocybin session was predictive of these changes in PH RSFC This study is limited by its small sample size and absence of a control condition. Moreover, correction for multiple testing was applied to the full RSN but not the specific (hypothesis-based) ROI analyses. Future research with more rigorous controls should serve to challenge and develop the present study’s findings and inferences. Assessing the relative contributions of, and potential interactions between, the different treatment factors (e.g. the drug and the accompanying psychological support) may be a particularly informative next step.",
16,10.1038/npp.2017.84,"The unspoken assumption, which I think we both share, is that the use of psilocybin at this stage requires a medical justification. Certainly, it started in western society as a putative aid to psychotherapy, but of course, it has an older cultural history as a constituent of magic mushrooms. Many believed and believe that the justification for the use of such drugs lies in their capacity to open the doors of perception, as Aldous Huxley put it. On this view, access to such drugs should be a recreational right, like access to alcohol, cigarettes, and increasingly cannabis. As with cannabis, medical use may be expected to promote wider discretionary use for any reason. Some may still regard this as a red light for the development of medical indications However, there is an important corollary to the continuing illegal status of psychedelics. It seems to me paradoxical, even incredible, that such drugs should not be available for medical use in conditions for which euthanasia is already available. In Belgium, neuropsychiatric disorders were first reported under euthanasia legislation in 2004/5. Of the first such 100 patients considered for euthanasia between 2007 and 2011, 58 had depression. Forty-eight of the total were accepted for euthanasia (35 completed) and six others had died by suicide within 12 months from the end of the study. Most patients were female, aged 40–60 years. Euthanasia for psychological suffering is similarly available in the Netherlands and Luxemburg (Thienpont et al, 2015) So, I think we need psilocybin in medicine but we should not forget the failures of human logic, which mean we need high-quality clinical trials","Our shared interest in the development of psychedelics, and particularly psilocybin, for medical use is a major point of convergence. There may be a subtle difference in our views of the so-called ‘mystical’ elements of the psychedelic experience, ie, both of us see the term ‘mystical’ as problematic—but whereas GMG views the acute ‘psychedelic experience’ as irrelevant to the clinical development of psychedelics, RLC-H sees it as a potentially exploitable component—especially as it has been shown to be predictive of long-term clinical outcomes (eg, in Johnson et al, 2014; Bogenschutz et al, 2015; Griffiths et al, 2016; Ross et al, 2016; Carhart-Harris et al, 2016a, b). Perhaps the most notable point of divergence, however, relates to the choice of patient population for the clinical development of psilocybin for depression. For GMG, the most obvious and relevant unmet need is treatment-resistant depression (see below), and while RLC-H accepts that treatment resistance is often the first port-of-call for the development of a novel intervention, he feels that unipolar depression more generally, will prove a better indication for this treatment. In his view, psilocybin will be safest, most effective, and easiest to implement, prior to the treatment-resistant stage of illness Focusing on treatment-resistant depression for the moment, however, we both recognize that a significant number of patients treated first line with either a SSRI or CBT fail to respond adequately (Gaynes, 2009). Persisting symptoms lead to enduring chronicity of depression, and there is no consensus in existing guidelines on what to do next. Moreover, the efficacy of secondary intervention is often modest and new medications can introduce new side effects. The duration of distress with TRD and its economic impact are considerable. We agree that TRD represents a valid point in the treatment pathway, where a single psychedelic intervention might find a place; however, RLC-H questions whether patients must wait until their depression is significantly stamped-in before psilocybin can be considered, and based on the speed and duration of treatment responses seen in the trials listed above, it seems reasonable to ask whether early intervention with psilocybin could be prophylactic—and there is also the issue of SSRIs obstructing the potential therapeutic action of psilocybin If it is to be TRD, however, then patient recruitment can be based on pre-existing criteria (Sackeim, 2001) and patients meeting them will not be rare and should not be excessively treatment resistant. As noted earlier, there is a significant challenge to the issue of continuing medication, most commonly with SSRIs. There is anecdotal evidence that psychedelic effects are largely attenuated by ongoing treatment with SSRIs (Bonson et al, 1996) and perhaps with other antidepressants (Bonson and Murphy, 1996). Downregulation of 5-HT2A receptors is a feature of many different first-line antidepressant drugs (Muguruza et al, 2014), as well as second-line antidepressant medications (eg, atypical antipsychotics) with significant 5-HT2AR antagonist properties (Gray and Roth, 2001). Any trial would ideally be conducted in patients withdrawn from such drugs for at least 2 weeks or so, but we accept that this is not always straightforward Moving on from questions of the optimal patient population, both of us can see merit in a multiple dose trial comparing, for example, 1, 10 and 25 mg of psilocybin. Such a design seems to overcome some of the problems any trial of a psychedelic will face. The ethical problem of equipoise seems satisfactory because we really do not know which dose, if any, will be effective, and patients can enter the study knowing that whatever group they are allocated to, they will receive active drug. The omission of a strict placebo control would be pragmatic in this sense, as expectation and preparation would be standardized. We know the highest dose of psilocybin will likely unblind participants and the expectation of a possible placebo would complicate recruitment. An approximation to an inert placebo condition may be met with the 1 mg psilocybin arm, as such a dose is likely too low to produce appreciable subjective or physiological effects (Griffiths et al, 2016). The differences between a dose mainly producing perceptual distortion (10 mg) and one more capable of producing the more profound, putatively ‘transformative’ aspects of the psychedelic experience (25 mg) is also of scientific and clinical interest Comparing mechanisms and/or efficacy with an established treatment would be a next step to advance the evidence base for psilocybin for TRD. For example, psilocybin could be compared with ketamine since it has some similarities: rapid, single-dose efficacy, and obvious subjective effects during its infusion. Psilocybin’s distinctive subjective effects and the implications of this for blinding would still remain a major challenge; moreover, as with ketamine, there will also remain the question of how much an acute response is sustained and whether a maintenance dose may be required The traditional view of the mechanism, whereby psilocybin works, emphasizes the importance of accompanying psychotherapy (Johnson et al, 2008; Richards, 2015). Accordingly, psychedelics administered without psychological support and/or a supportive environment may have limited antidepressant efficacy, and in very rare cases, could even worsen a patient’s condition (Oram, 2014). We share the view that the presence of psychological support is an essential component of the psychedelic treatment model (Johnson et al, 2008) but we also recognize that the magnitude and nature of its contribution needs to be better defined and tested Pragmatically, we accept that minimizing the active psychological work of the therapy would be desirable (eg, therapy time is expensive) and scientifically, doing so would allow drug effects and dose to be better identified. Critically however, any such therapy minimization should not be allowed to jeopardize patient safety (Johnson et al, 2008). A future challenge will be to learn how psychological interventions can maximize the advantages of the psychedelic state. For example, we can imagine how cognitive therapy, attentional-bias training and/or de-sensitization could be investigated with or without psilocybin assistance In other respects, a psilocybin trial is easier to conduct than studies requiring continuing adherence to a daily oral dose of an antidepressant. Exposure to the treatment can be completely controlled and follow-up can be relatively pragmatic. It seems logical to determine an early proximal end point to prove initial impact of treatment and then to follow subsequent illness course as comprehensively as possible. In this way, we will be able to determine time to supplementary treatment, document recovery of symptoms and function, and perhaps objectify improvement using a simple frictionless measure of activity-like geolocation (Palmius et al, 2016) In the short term, there will also be a need to demonstrate cost effectiveness. The requirement for psychological support and/or a supportive environment could be a major limitation of the psychedelic treatment model. However, direct medical costs need to be netted off against the social and economic costs of illness In summary, a door has been opened for the medical repurposing of psychedelics. The possibility exists that drugs like psilocybin can meet a major unmet need in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. For GMG, treatment-resistant depression is the most logical place to start because of the uncertainty around the choice of next-step treatment after an SSRI fails, and while RLC-H accepts this (Carhart-Harris et al, 2016a, b), he looks forward to a time when an individual may receive psilocybin before the ruts of depression are allowed to deepen (Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011). Regardless of who the ‘right’ patient population might be eventually, a key challenge now is to design the optimal trial to demonstrate efficacy, agree its validity with regulatory authorities and fund it."
17,10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.04.005,"Our data show that psilocybin biases emotional processing toward positive relative to negative information, an effect that is consistent across different psychological domains. Specifically, psilocybin first enhanced positive mood states; second, decreased recognition of negative facial expression; and third, increased behavior toward positive relative to negative cues. In contrast to these generalized effects of the serotonergic agonist psilocybin, a more specific role for 5-HT2A receptors in elevating mood and attenuating the recognition of negative facial expression is indicated by the finding that the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin blocked these psilocybin-induced effects Psilocybin predominantly enhanced positive mood states, as evidenced by the marked increase in the positive affect but not negative affect subscale scores of the PANAS questionnaire, as well as by the increase in blissful but not anxiety subscale scores of the 5D-ASC questionnaire. These strong effects of psilocybin on mood contrasts with the usually lacking acute mood effects of drugs that modulate the serotonergic tone such as acute tryptophan depletion (30, 35, 54) or SSRI administration (31, 32, 55). This apparent disparity suggests that a specific activation of certain 5-HT subreceptors is necessary to acutely enhance mood. Indeed, the finding that the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin blocked the mood-enhancing effects of psilocybin suggests that 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in regulating positive mood states. Moreover, we argue that the additional stimulation of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C receptors by psilocybin is rather unlikely to contribute to the mood effects of psilocybin, because ketanserin has nearly no affinity to 5-HT1A receptors and about fiftyfold higher affinity to 5-HT2A compared with 5-HT2C receptors (National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program: http://pdsp.med.unc.edu). Furthermore, the serotonin 2B/5-HT2C agonist meta-chlorphenylpiperazin induces anxiety rather than positive mood states (56). Finally, it is unlikely that expectation of receiving psilocybin considerably contributed to the mood effects, because various drug combinations were administrated in a double-blind procedure and subjects were instructed that the psychological effects of psilocybin vary largely between and within subjects Serotonin 2A receptors appear also to be crucially involved in the recognition of negative facial expressions, because ketanserin blocked psilocybin-induced attenuation in recognizing negative emotional states from the eye region of human faces. This finding is in line with the central role of serotonin in emotional facial recognition as previously established by pharmacologic (29, 30, 31, 32, 33) and genetic studies (57) but extends this notion by showing that specific activation of 5-HT2A receptors likely biases facial recognition away from negative emotion. This mechanism might also contribute to the attenuated recognition of negative facial expression as previously observed after a single dose of MDMA (33) and after chronic administration of SSRIs (29, 58), because MDMA has a moderate affinity at 5-HT2A receptors (59) and chronic SSRI administration changes 5-HT2A receptor density (60, 61) In the emotional go/nogo task, psilocybin enhanced the response bias toward positive relative to neutral and negative emotional stimuli, which was evidenced at the behavioral level by the psilocybin-induced increase in reaction times to negative and neutral compared with positive stimuli. In addition, this response bias was modulated by the sequential context of the stimuli across all drug conditions, an effect that was augmented by psilocybin administration. That is, across all drug conditions, sequential repetition of positive and neutral stimuli facilitated processing (62, 63), as indicated by decreased reaction times to positive and neutral stimuli. Interestingly, this sequential facilatory effect was lacking after negative stimuli, a finding that has not yet been reported in emotional go/nogo tasks but was previously observed in semantic (64, 65) and negative affective priming tasks (66, 67, 68). Given that this lacking facilitation has been interpreted as an inhibition of negative concepts within the attentional (66) or memory system (65) and that psilocybin prolonged reaction time for repeated negative stimuli but decreased it for repeated positive stimuli, psilocybin may also increase inhibition of negative relative to positive concepts in the attentional or memory system Support for such a psilocybin-induced shift in the attentional system was revealed by the effect of psilocybin on event-related potentials. The event-related potentials analysis indicated that across all drug conditions, the word valence affected early and late response selection, inhibition, and attention processes as indexed by the decreased N2 and enhanced P3 component for emotional relative to neutral stimuli (69, 70). Most importantly, while psilocybin and ketanserin did not modulate these valence-specific effects during the N2 time range, psilocybin strongly decreased the P300 component in all valence conditions and particularly for negative and neutral stimuli. Because this valence-dependent P300 decrease was equally present in both the go and nogo conditions, it is conceivable that this psilocybin-induced change in emotional processing is neither specific for response selection (go) nor specific for inhibition (nogo) but rather reflects a more general process underlying the P300. For instance, the P300 amplitude is strongly modulated by the amount of attentional resource allocation (71), and several behavioral studies previously showed that psilocybin attenuates attentional performance (41, 72, 73). This suggests, on the one hand, that the strong psilocybin-induced decrease of the P300 seen across all valence conditions might reflect an important electrophysiological index of the previously reported psilocybin-induced attentional deficits. On the other hand, the small valence-dependent decrease suggests that psilocybin may attenuate the allocation of attentional resources to neutral and negative stimuli more strongly than to positive stimuli, which results in a relative positive attentional bias Contrary to the crucial contribution of 5-HT2A receptors in modulating mood states and emotional face recognition, the psilocybin-induced relative bias toward the processing of positive emotions in the go/nogo task were not blocked by pretreatment with ketanserin. Thus, the psilocybin-induced emotional bias might rather be due to a stimulation of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C receptors than 5-HT2A receptors. However, the strong valence-independent reduction of the P300 seen after psilocybin administration was partially reversed by ketanserin, indicating an involvement of 5-HT2A receptors in the valence-independent attentional performance In the present study, psilocybin produced behavioral and electrophysiological effects that were opposite to the dysfunctional emotional processing bias seen in depressed subjects in emotional facial recognition (1, 29, 30, 31), goal-directed behavior (2, 3, 70), and mood states. For example, in the emotional go/nogo task, psilocybin increased RTs and decreased P300 amplitudes, particulary for negative and neutral stimuli, while depressed subjects were delayed in responding to positive cues (2, 3) and displayed increased P300 component for negative stimuli (70). Thus, it appears that psilocybin may have the potential to acutely shift dysfunctional emotional biases in depression. Such an acute shift might, in conjunction with the reported effect of psilocybin on neuroplastic factors (24), lead to sustained adaptations and may therefore account for the discussed antidepressive potential of psilocybin-like compounds (24, 28). Hence, further studies using different and multiple doses of psilocybin are indicated to explore whether the effect of psilocybin on emotional biases are dose-dependent and whether psilocybin may shift the negative emotional biases seen in depression Furthermore, here we identify 5-HT2A receptor activity as a potential crucial pharmacologic target in the treatment of negative mood states and negative emotional facial recognition bias. In line with this finding, negative mood is associated with pessimistic attitudes (74) and medication-free major depression patients with high pessimistic attitudes have increased 5-HT2A receptor binding in the prefrontal cortex compared with healthy control subjects (8, 9, 10). Furthermore, chronic administration of SSRIs not only shifts negative mood states and negative bias in facial recognition in depressed patients (29, 58) but also seems to normalize alterations in 5-HT2A receptor densities in depressed subjects (60, 61). In summary, the present study indicates that the assessment of the effects of psilocybin provides a valuable framework to identify neuropsychopharmacologic mechanisms underlying dysfunctional emotional biases and the putative antidepressant effects of psilocybin and related compounds.",
18,10.1017/S0033291718001356,"We found evidence of rapid antidepressant effect after a single dosing session with ayahuasca when compared with placebo. Depression severity changed significantly but differently for the ayahuasca and placebo groups. Improvements in the psychiatric scales in the ayahuasca group were significantly higher than those of the placebo group at all time points after dosing, with increasing between-group effect sizes from D1 to D7. Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2 and were significantly higher in the ayahuasca group at D7. Between-groups remission rate showed a trend toward significance at D7 The within-group effect size found for ayahuasca at D7 (Cohen's d = 2.22) is compatible with our earlier open-label study (Cohen's d at D7 = 1.83) and compatible with the one found in a recent open-label trial with psilocybin for depression Our results are comparable with randomized controlled trials that used ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Although both ketamine and ayahuasca are associated with rapid antidepressant effects, their response time-courses and mechanisms of action seem to differ. Previous studies with ketamine have found the largest between-group effect size at D1 (Cohen's d = 0.89), reducing toward D7 In contrast, the effect sizes observed herein were large, but smallest, at D1 (Cohen's d = 0.84), and largest at D7 (Cohen's d = 1.49). These differences are also reflected in the response rates. At D1, the response rate to ketamine lies between 37 and 70%, whereas in our study 50% of the patients responded to ayahuasca. At D7, the ketamine response rate ranges between 7 and 35% while in our study 64% responded to ayahuasca. The placebo effect was high in our study, and higher than most studies with. While we find a response rate to placebo of 46% at D1, and 26% at D7, ketamine trials have found a placebo effect of the order of 0–6% at D1, and 0–11% at D7 Several factors may account for the high placebo effect observed herein. First, the higher placebo effect has been found in patients with low socioeconomic status which was the case of our study. Most patients were living under significant psychosocial stressors, and during our trial, they stayed at a ‘very comfortable and very supportive environment’, as reported by the patients themselves. Therefore, part of the increased placebo effects found in our study might be due to this ‘care effect’. Second, patients with comorbid personality disorders present higher placebo responses and in our study, most patients (76%) also suffered from personality disorders, most of them in cluster B. A growing body of evidence gives support to the observed rapid antidepressant effects of ayahuasca For instance, sigma-1 receptors (σ1R) have been implicated in depression, and it was reported to be activated by N, N-DMT Moreover, it has been shown that the administration of σ1R agonists results in antidepressant-like effects, which are blocked by σ1R antagonism Furthermore, σ1R upregulates neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), proteins whose regulation and expression seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that antidepressants with σ1R agonist profile do not present clinically significant antidepressant effect. For instance, the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity for σ1R do not present response rates compatible to that was found herein The effects observed might be in part due to the presence of MAOi in the brew. In fact, studies in animal models reported that chronic administration of harmine reduces immobility time, increases climbing and swimming time, reverses anhedonia, increases adrenal gland weight, and increases BDNF levels in the hippocampus All of these are compatible with antidepressant effects. Likewise, harmine seems to stimulate neurogenesis of human neural progenitor cells, derived from pluripotent stem cells and progenitor cells from adult mice brains a mechanism also observed in rodents following antidepressant treatment. In addition, a recent study in rodents found that a single ayahuasca dose increases swimming time in a forced-swim test Brain circuits modulated by psychedelics show great overlap with those involved in mood disorders We recently found that a single ayahuasca session in patients with depression increases blood flow in brain regions consistently implicated in the regulation of mood and emotions, such as the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area Moreover, we have shown that ayahuasca reduces the activity of the Default Mode NetworkOver the last two decades, mental health evaluations of regular ayahuasca consumers have shown preserved cognitive function, increased well-being, reduction of anxiety, and depressive symptoms when compared to non-ayahuasca consumers Moreover, a recent study observed that a single dose of ayahuasca enhanced mindfulness-related capacities and meditation practices have been associated with antidepressant effects Prior studies suggest that elements of the psychedelic experience, such as experiences of mystical-type, account for the therapeutic benefit We found significant increased MEQ30 scores during the effects of ayahuasca. We also observed an inverse correlation between MADRS score changes at D7 with ‘transcendence of time and space’ MEQ30 factor Furthermore, HRS dimensions seem important to the clinical outcome, particularly perception a subscale that comprehends changes in visual, auditory, and body sensations. Visions are common during the effects of ayahuasca, and are most frequent with the eyes closed It has been suggested that visions may play an important role in the therapeutic effect of ayahuasca, as they may help bringing clarity to introspective events It is interesting to observe that changes in perception taken alone are not sufficient to predict the positive clinical outcome, as for instance, we find that some patients presented increased scores in ‘perception’ without significant clinical response No serious adverse events were observed during or after dosing. Although 100% of the patients reported feeling safe, the ayahuasca session was not necessarily a pleasant experience. In fact, some patients reported the opposite, as the experience was accompanied by much psychological distress. Most patients reported nausea, and about 57% have vomited, although vomiting is traditionally not considered a side effect of ayahuasca, but rather part of a purging process Although promising, this study has some caveats and limitations worth mentioning. The number of participants is modest, and therefore randomized trials in larger populations are necessary. The study was limited to patients with treatment-resistant depression, with a long course of illness, and high comorbid personality disorder, which altogether precludes a simple extension of these results to other classes of depression. Another challenge of the research with psychedelics is maintaining double blindness, as the effects of psychedelics are unique. We were particularly keen to ensure blindness throughout the entire experiment, and to that end, we adopted a series of additional measures to preserve blindness. All patients were naïve to ayahuasca, with no previous experience with any other psychedelic substance. Clinical evaluations involved a team of five psychiatrists. For every patient, one psychiatrist was responsible for clinical evaluation during the dosing session and a different one for the follow-up assessments. The substance used as placebo increased anxiety and induced nausea. In fact, five patients misclassified placebo as ayahuasca, and two of them showed a response at D7 (online Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, we believe blindness was adequately preserved in our study Since the prohibition of psychedelics in the late 1960s, research with these substances has almost come to a halt. Before research restrictions, psychedelics were at early stage testing for many psychiatric conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcohol dependence. By mid-1960s, over 40.000 subjects had participated in clinical research with psychedelics, most of them in uncontrolled settings (Vollenweider and Kometer, To our knowledge, this is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial to investigate the antidepressant potential of a psychedelic in a population of patients with treatment-resistant depression. Overall, this study brings new evidence supporting the safety and therapeutic value of psychedelics, dosed within an appropriate setting, to help treat depression.",
19,10.1177/2045125316638008,"The mechanisms of action responsible for the beneficial effects produced by ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD are not completely understood. Preclinical evidence show that ayahuasca [Lima et al. 2006; Pic-Taylor et al. 2015] and its β-carbolines harmine [Aricioglu-Kartal et al. 2003; Farzin and Mansouri, 2006; Fortunato et al. 2009, 2010a, 2010b; Réus et al. 2010, 2012; Brierley and Davidson, 2012; Owaisat et al. 2012] and harmaline [Glick et al. 1994; Hilber and Chapillon, 2005; Wu et al. 2009], as well as psilocybin [Matsushima et al. 2009] and LSD [Zghoul and Blier, 2003; Buchborn et al. 2014], have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Experimental studies with healthy volunteers report that acute administration of DMT [Gillin et al. 1976; Strassman et al. 1994; Riba et al. 2015], psilocybin [Griffiths et al. 2006, 2011; Studerus et al. 2011; Kometer et al. 2012; Kraehenmann et al. 2016], and LSD [Schmid et al. 2016] increase positive mood. Furthermore, observational and preliminary experimental studies of ayahuasca consumers [Grob et al. 1996; Barbosa et al. 2005, 2009, 2012; da Silveira et al. 2005; Doering-Silveira et al. 2005; dos Santos et al. 2007, 2016; Halpern et al. 2008; Labate et al. 2009, 2014; Fábregas et al. 2010; Labate and Jungaberle, 2011; Bouso et al. 2012; dos Santos, 2013; Thomas et al. 2013; Bouso and Riba, 2014; Fernández and Fábregas, 2014; Fernández et al. 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Loizaga Pazzi, 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Verres, 2014; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2014; Winkelman, 2014], as well as case reports [Leonard and Rapoport, 1987; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Hanes, 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Perrine, 1999; Wilcox, 2014] and observational studies [Krebs and Johansen, 2013; Hendricks et al. 2014, 2015; Johansen and Krebs, 2015] involving psilocybin and LSD, also suggest that these drugs have therapeutic potentials Since DMT, psilocybin and LSD are agonists of serotonin 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors [Pierce and Peroutka, 1989; McKenna et al. 1990; Glennon et al. 2000; Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Nichols, 2004; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013; Tylš et al. 2014; Halberstadt, 2015], these receptors may be involved in the therapeutic effects of these tryptamines. In fact, cortical expression of 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor is altered in post-mortem samples of depressed patients, suggesting that these receptors are involved in emotional processing [Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Baumeister et al. 2014]. Furthermore, animal models and clinical studies show that 5-HT1A receptor agonists have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties [Nutt, 2005; Katzman, 2009; Baumeister et al. 2014], and 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists reduce anxiety- and depression-related behavior in animals [Masuda and Sugiyama, 2000; Nic Dhonnchadha et al. 2003a, 2003b; Baumeister et al. 2014] Another possible mechanism of therapeutic action is the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission induced by 5-HT2A-receptor agonism [Nichols, 2004; González-Maeso et al. 2008; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Moreno et al. 2011, 2013; Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013; Santini et al. 2014; Buchborn et al. 2015; Carbonaro et al. 2015; Halberstadt, 2015]. Activation of frontocortical glutamate networks by 5-HT2A receptor agonists could lead to increases in the expression of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and in the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, thus enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis [Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Ross, 2012; Baumeister et al. 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. For instance, depression is associated with deficient neurogenesis and neurotrophic activity, and BDNF levels are decreased in depressed patients and normalized after antidepressant treatment [Baumeister et al. 2014]. Furthermore, alcohol self-administration and conditioned place preference are inversely related to BDNF or GDNF expression in animal models [Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. Interestingly, a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of psilocybin produced a trend toward increased neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus 2 weeks after its administration, while a high dose (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurogenesis [Catlow et al. 2013]. These results suggest that the effects of psilocybin on neurogenesis are dose- and time-related Agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor could also produce beneficial effects due to an anti-inflammatory action [Nau et al. 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; dos Santos, 2014; Szabo et al. 2014]. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-1β are associated with depressive illness, while normalization of these levels are related to antidepressant effects [Baumeister et al. 2014; Réus et al. 2015]. The 5-HT2A receptor is expressed in central and peripheral immune-related cells [Stefulj et al. 2000; Nau et al. 2013], and 5-HT2A agonists may modulate the immune system [Forrer and Goldner, 1951; Feld et al. 1958; Sackler et al. 1963, 1966; Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964; House et al. 1994, 1997; Stefulj et al. 2000; Passie et al. 2002; Davydova et al. 2010; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; dos Santos et al. 2011, 2012; Frecska et al. 2013; Nau et al. 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; dos Santos, 2014; Szabo et al. 2014]. Indeed, in vitro studies show that LSD inhibits the production of IL-6 [House et al. 1994, 1997], and the serotonergic hallucinogen 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl-isopropylamine (DOI, a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) produces anti-inflammatory effects in mice by blocking TNF-α-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cell adhesion (Icam-1, Vcam-1), cytokine (IL-6, IL-1β), and chemokine (Mcp-1, Cx3cl1) genes, and expression of VCAM-1 protein [Nau et al. 2013]. These effects were blocked by a 5-HT2A selective antagonist, implicating this receptor in the anti-inflammatory effects of DOI Moreover, DMT and the related tryptamine 5-methoxy-DMT (5-MeO-DMT) reduced the mRNA expression and the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α, increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and inhibited the immune responses of inflammatory T helper 1/17 (Th1/Th17) cells [Szabo et al. 2014]. Interestingly, gene knock-down experiments showed that the effects of both tryptamines on TNFα, IL-10, and Th1/Th17 responses were mediated by the sigma-1 receptor, and recent studies show that DMT is an endogenous agonist for the sigma-1 receptor [Fontanilla et al. 2009; Su et al. 2009; Frecska et al. 2013; Szabo et al. 2014] The possible modulation of the sigma-1 receptor by DMT shows that other mechanisms of action that are not dependent of the 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors may also be involved in the therapeutic action of classic hallucinogens. For instance, harmine, THH and harmaline reversibly inhibit MAO-A [Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977; McKenna et al. 1984; Ott, 1994, 1999, 2004; Riba et al. 2001, 2003; McKenna and Riba, 2016], and reversible inhibitors of MAO-A (RIMAs) are clinically used as anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs [Yamada and Yasuhara, 2004; Nutt, 2005]. Moreover, rodent studies show that the antidepressive effects of harmine are associated with increases in BDNF levels [Fortunato et al. 2009; 2010a; 2010b] Neural oxidative stress and subsequent neuroinflammation are associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression [Réus et al. 2015], and several preclinical studies show that harmine and harmaline have antioxidant and neuroprotective effects that seem to be mediated by MAO inhibition [Maher and Davis, 1996; Biradar et al. 2013], regulation of the dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase DYRK1A [Frost et al. 2011], modulation of dopaminergic [Lee et al. 2000; Schwarz et al. 2003], cholinergic [Biradar et al. 2013], and glutamatergic [Maher and Davis, 1996; Li et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2014] pathways, interaction with voltage-gated membrane channels [Splettstoesser et al. 2005], and regulation of cell-energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxygen free radical scavenging [Moura et al. 2007; Réus et al. 2010, 2012; Abelaira et al. 2013]. Furthermore, harmine also has anti-inflammatory properties that seem to be mediated at least in part by DYRK1A [Khor et al. 2015] The antiaddictive effects of ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD could also be related to the activation of the dopaminergic system. For instance, preclinical studies show that LSD [Nichols, 2004; Passie et al. 2008; Hintzen and Passie, 2010], psilocybin [Tylš et al. 2014; Sakashita et al. 2015], and ayahuasca [de Castro-Neto et al. 2013] may indirectly stimulate dopaminergic pathways, probably through 5-HT2A-receptor activation (LSD, psilocybin, and DMT) or MAO inhibition (β-carbolines). Moreover, acute psilocybin administration indirectly increased (through 5-HT1A/2A receptors) the release of dopamine in the ventral striatum in humans [Vollenweider et al. 1999]. Animal studies suggest that the antiaddictive potentials of harmine and harmaline appear to involve imidazoline, glutamate, and dopamine pathways [Glick et al. 1994; Iurlo et al. 2001; Aricioglu-Kartal et al. 2003; Schwarz et al. 2003; Brierley and Davidson, 2012, 2013; Owaisat et al. 2012] Recent neuroimaging studies in humans suggest that the mood-enhancing properties of ayahuasca and psilocybin could be related to modifications in the activity of brain regions such as the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), involved in emotional processing, and the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain regions associated with introspection and other internally focused functions [Riba et al. 2006; Araujo et al. 2012; Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2014; Tagliazucchi et al. 2014; Bouso et al. 2015; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; Alonso et al. 2015; Kraehenmann et al. 2016; McKenna and Riba, 2016]. Psilocybin reduced amygdala reactivity, which correlated with increases in positive mood [Kraehenmann et al. 2016]. Increased activity of the DMN is associated with intensification of the self-reference process of rumination, which is an important depressive symptom, and acute administration of ayahuasca [Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015] and psilocybin [Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a] reduces brain activity in key regions of the DMN, such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Moreover, regular ayahuasca use is associated with cortical thinning in the PCC [Bouso et al. 2015] Early human research with classical hallucinogens suggests that the therapeutic properties of these compounds are related at least in part to their effects on perceptions, emotions, and thoughts [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. The subjective experience produced by these drugs would create a ‘window of opportunity’ in which changes in unhealthy thoughts, emotions, and behaviors could take place in a psychotherapeutic context [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. Recent neuroimaging studies with ayahuasca and psilocybin seem to corroborate these early ideas by suggesting that the altered state of consciousness produced by these drugs would create a disruption or interruption of the repetitive, rigid, and pathological pattern of negative and compulsive thoughts present in anxiety and mood disorders and in drug dependence, contributing to mental flexibility and changes in perspective, values, and behavior [Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2014; Tagliazucchi et al. 2014; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; McKenna and Riba, 2016] Furthermore, the ability of classical hallucinogens to elicit religious, mystical, transcendent, or peak experiences has also been proposed as a possible psychological mechanism associated with the beneficial effects of these drugs [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Griffiths et al. 2006, 2008, 2011; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; MacLean et al. 2011; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. Indeed, recent studies in healthy individuals show that acute psilocybin administration induces highly meaningful and spiritually significant experiences with sustained positive changes in attitudes, mood, personality, and behavior [Griffiths et al. 2006, 2008, 2011; MacLean et al. 2011]. Moreover, a secondary analysis of the data from the study of psilocybin and tobacco dependence reported that the mystical-type effects of psilocybin and their personal meaning, spiritual significance, and impact on well-being were correlated with improvements in smoking cessation [Garcia-Romeu et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2014]. A qualitative follow-up assessment of the patients enrolled in the study of LSD-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with a life-threatening disease also suggested that the intense emotional experiences with mystic-like features produced by LSD could mediate the observed long-term beneficial changes in perspectives, attitudes, values, and quality of life [Gasser et al. 2014, 2015] Interestingly, these findings are consistent with studies that suggest that the dissociative, psychotomimetic, and mystical-type effects produced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine may mediate the anxiolytic [Kolp et al. 2007], antidepressive [Sos et al. 2013; Luckenbaugh et al. 2014], and antiaddictive [Krupitsky et al. 1992, 2002, 2007; Krupitsky and Grinenko, 1997; Jansen, 2001; Kolp et al. 2006; Krupitsky and Kolp, 2007; Dakwar et al. 2014a, 2014b] properties of this nonclassic hallucinogen. Moreover, some authors suggested that the temporary mental state produced by classic hallucinogens might induce profound long-term effects by producing an ‘inverse posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like effect’ in which a highly significant and positive experience would cause lasting beneficial changes, as opposed to chronic negative mood and other detrimental symptoms caused by a single traumatic event, which characterizes PTSD [MacLean et al. 2011; Young 2013; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2014] Human hallucinogenic research performed in the 1960s and 1970s also suggests that the context and the psychotherapeutic approach used in combination with classic hallucinogens are also important components of the beneficial effects produced by these drugs [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. The methodology of the clinical trials included in the present systematic review are very diverse regarding this topic: three studies assessed the effects of single-dose exposures without psychotherapeutic approaches [Moreno et al. 2006; Grob et al. 2011; Osório et al. 2015] and three trials included some form of psychological intervention over a few weeks [Gasser et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2014; Bogenschutz et al. 2015]. The studies without psychotherapy suggest that biochemical mechanisms may be involved in the beneficial effects observed. On the other hand, the inclusion of psychological interventions in the other studies suggests that at least some part of the therapeutic results is related to nondrug factors. Placebo effects and enhanced suggestibility may also play a role as adjuncts in hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy [Young, 2013; Carhart-Harris et al. 2015] Future research should investigate the possible influence of different psychotherapeutic approaches or other nondrug factors – such as patient preparation before drug administration and integration of the drug session afterwards – in mediating the therapeutic properties of classic hallucinogens No serious adverse reactions were reported in any of the clinical trials reviewed in the present systematic review, suggesting that classic hallucinogens can be safely administered to patients suffering anxiety, depression, or drug dependence. Previous experimental studies of acute ayahuasca administration to healthy volunteers [Riba et al. 2001, 2003, 2006; dos Santos et al. 2011, 2012; de Araujo et al. 2012; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; McKenna and Riba, 2016] also suggest that this drug can be safely administered in controlled experimental settings. Observational studies of long-term ayahuasca consumers [Grob et al. 1996; Barbosa et al. 2005, 2009, 2012; da Silveira et al. 2005; Doering-Silveira et al. 2005; Halpern et al. 2008; Fábregas et al. 2010; Bouso et al. 2012, 2015; dos Santos, 2013] also suggest that this brew has a low toxicity profile when consumed in ritual contexts. Previous clinical research [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Strassman, 1984; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Liester, 2014; Smith et al. 2014; Tylš et al. 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016] and recent observational studies [Krebs and Johansen, 2013; Hendricks et al. 2014, 2015; Johansen and Krebs, 2015], drug harm or risk assessments [Nutt et al. 2010; van Amsterdam et al. 2011, 2013, 2015; Morgan et al. 2013], and experimental studies with healthy volunteers also suggest that psilocybin and LSD can be safely administered in controlled settings.","A main limitation of the present systematic review is the inclusion of a small number of studies (six) with small sample sizes (6–15 volunteers), which limits the generalization of the reported results. Included studies also show a high degree of heterogeneity, and three of the selected citations did not include placebo or a control group (open-label, proof-of-concept studies). Another important limitation is the difficulty in disentangling placebo effects, drug effects, and the influence of the psychological intervention included in the clinical trial However, despite these important limitations, results consistently showed that ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD produced anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects in patients, and these results were also observed in animal studies and with healthy volunteers. Given the low success rates of current pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for drug dependence and anxiety and mood disorders, and considering the high morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders, it is necessary to perform more studies with these drugs, even if only a small portion of patients may reduce their suffering with these drugs. Future studies should include more patients, placebo or active placebo, randomized and double-blind designs, and multiple doses during treatment. Moreover, the influence of psychological interventions and the possible increases in therapeutic efficacy proportionated by these psychotherapeutic approaches should be better explored Currently available pharmacological treatments for drug dependence and anxiety and mood disorders have limited efficacy and often produce important adverse reactions that may limit treatment continuation. Classic tryptamine hallucinogens such as ayahuasca/DMT, psilocybin, and LSD are safely administered in controlled settings and several basic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that these drugs have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects. Such beneficial properties seem to be mediated by an agonist action of these compounds on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors, which are involved in emotional processing, regulation of neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory actions, and modulation of frontal and medial brain structures. Other mechanisms of action not related to serotonergic receptors, such as regulation of cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxidative stress, also appear to mediate these therapeutic effects The reviewed studies suggest that the therapeutic use of classic hallucinogens may offer to some patients fast-acting and prolonged beneficial effects after a single dose, producing few adverse effects. Indeed, interest in the medicinal uses of this class of drugs is increasing: new clinical trials investigating the effects of psilocybin in the treatment of alcoholism, cocaine dependence, tobacco dependence, and anxiety and depression associated with cancer are currently underway [ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02061293, NCT02037126, NCT01943994, NCT00957359, NCT00465595]. Moreover, our group recently replicated the results of the original open-label, proof-of-concept study [Osório et al. 2015] but including an increased sample size (n =17) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), showing that ayahuasca antidepressive properties may be associated with increased blood perfusion in brain areas related to depressive symptoms (Sanches et al. 2016 “This reference was not included in the review because it was not published at the time of the electronic search”). Our group is currently performing randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the antidepressive and anxiolytic potentials of ayahuasca [Frood, 2015] Further studies are urgently needed to better understand the effects of classical tryptamine hallucinogens in psychiatric disorders."
20,10.1002/cpt.557,"One indication under early investigation was treatment with LSD of psychosocial distress in dying cancer patients.2-4 About two-thirds of cancer patients given LSD had improved mood and reduced anxiety and fear of death. More recently, Grob et al.5 administered 0.2 mg/kg oral psilocybin vs. niacin placebo to 12 patients with advanced-stage cancer having a diagnosis of anxiety related to their cancer. Psilocybin is a small molecular weight compound that occurs in nature. A variety of mushrooms from multiple genera, including the genus Psilocybe, produce psilocybin. Figure 1 shows an example of Psilocybe cubensis. The study observed no clinically significant adverse events, consistent with earlier trials. With the small sample size, they reported nonsignificant trends for benefits of psilocybin compared with niacin placebo on measures of depression and anxiety. Compared with pretreatment baseline, however, the patients' Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) trait anxiety subscale scores revealed a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Similarly, the patients' Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores showed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months compared with baseline.More recently, Carhart-Harris et al.6 published the results of an open-label feasibility trial of 12 patients with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression. Subjects received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. The study assessed depressive symptoms from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. Because of the lack of a control group in this study, readers should use caution in the interpretation of the results QIDS depression scores significantly decreased from baseline at 1 week and 3 months posttreatment, with the maximum effect at 2 weeks. BDI and clinician-administered ratings confirmed these results. All patients showed some reduction in depression severity at 1 week that was sustained in the majority for 3 months. According to standard criteria for determining remission (i.e., a BDI score ≤9), 8 (67%) of the 12 patients achieved complete remission at 1 week, and seven patients (58%) continued to meet criteria for response (50% reduction in BDI score relative to baseline) at 3 months, with five of them (42%) still in complete remission. STAI-T anxiety and SHAPS anhedonia scores also significantly decreased at 1 week and 3 months posttreatment from baseline We are aware of two larger randomized placebo-controlled studies recently completed by groups at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), directed by Roland Griffiths and one of the present authors (M.W.J.),7 and at New York University (NYU), directed by Stephen Ross.8 The results of these two studies are in press. Unlike the Carhart-Harris et al. and Grob et al. studies, they are reasonably large, well-powered phase II trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients suffering from cancer-related psychosocial distress (CRPD). These two studies represent the first sufficiently powered, formal double-blind, placebo-controlled assessment of a psychedelic agent for therapeutic effect using modern clinical approaches and assessment instruments. Neither study observed significant adverse events. Both of these studies found remarkable efficacy that is unprecedented for CRPD with any currently available conventional therapies The JHU study7 employed a two-session, double-blind, crossover design to investigate the effects of a high oral psilocybin dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg; equivalent to ∼0.31 and ∼0.43 mg/kg, respectively) with a low dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg; equivalent to ∼0.014 and ∼0.043 mg/kg, respectively), on outcome measures relevant to anxiety or depressive disorders caused or exacerbated by the cancer diagnosis. Therapeutically relevant outcome measures showing sustained effects at 6 months included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the STAI, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and the BDI. Consistent with persisting positive effects previously observed in healthy volunteers,9 the immediate postsession mystical experience score showed a significant correlation with therapeutic efficacy. The definition of mystical experience is a subjective experience involving substantial participant endorsement of the following categories: internal unity, external unity, noetic quality, sacredness, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and ineffability.10 The study showed that a single psilocybin dose, given under supportive conditions to screened and prepared participants, produced substantial and enduring decreases in anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis The NYU study8 used a therapeutic approach and clinical setting that were similar to the one employed in the JHU study, the chief difference being the use of niacin as the active placebo control instead of low-dose psilocybin. Again, the study documented dramatic symptom reductions, with large effect sizes comparable to the JHU study, and efficacy sustained for 6 months after treatment. As with the JHU study, the authors safely administered a single moderate psilocybin dose (21 mg/70 kg) in conjunction with psychotherapy to a cohort of patients with life-threatening cancer, and observed acute and sustained anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Here too, the intensity of the subjective mystical experience correlated with clinical benefit, including improved attitudes toward disease progression and death, improved quality of life, and increased spiritual well-being Similarly, Gasser et al.11 employed LSD-assisted therapy in 12 patients with anxiety related to a diagnosis of life-threatening diseases. Patients received either 200 μg LSD (free base) or a 20 μg active placebo dose of LSD with an open-label crossover to 200 μg LSD after unblinding. There were no serious adverse effects associated with the treatment. Positive trends found using the STAI persisted for 12 months after treatment. Subsequently, Gasser et al.12 followed up the same participants 12 months later to examine long-term effects on anxiety and explore subjective experiences and lasting psychologic effects. Nine of the original subjects participated. Gasser et al.12 found that the STAI state and trait scores did not increase after the end of the study. In semistructured interviews, seven of nine participants reported a sustained reduction in anxiety. None of the participants reported lasting negative effects. The authors concluded that LSD-assisted psychotherapy in patients with a life-threatening illness demonstrated safety and positive stable treatment outcomes at long-term follow-up Recently, in an open-label clinical trial in patients suffering from depression, ayahuasca, a South American plant decoction that contains the hallucinogenic compound N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), produced marked improvement in depressive symptoms with no mania or hypomania for up to 21 days after a single dose.",
21,10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.04.010,"In this study, we found that psilocybin attenuated task-induced activation in the amygdala in response to negative and neutral pictures but had no effect on activation of the primary motor cortex. This psilocybin-induced effect was significantly stronger in the right amygdala than in the left amygdala. Furthermore, psilocybin increased subjective reports of positive mood but did not increase anxiety. Importantly, the effect of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity was most strongly associated with positive mood change. Reduction of amygdala reactivity by psilocybin is consistent with our a priori hypothesis and provides a mechanistic framework to understand psilocybin-induced effects on emotion processing. The current findings support the notion that psilocybin has the potential to normalize limbic hyperactivity in persons with depressed mood state We did not find a significant drug by emotion interaction, and planned comparisons showed a reduction of amygdala reactivity in response to both negative and neutral pictures. Therefore, our results do not support a valence-specific effect of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity, i.e., we cannot conclude that psilocybin specifically reduced amygdala reactivity in response to negative pictures. This is in line with previous electrophysiological studies where valence-specific effects of psilocybin on emotion processing have been found but only for positive stimuli, not for neutral stimuli, and only within the first 200 milliseconds after stimulus onset (19, 20, 21). For example, Bernasconi et al. (21) found a decrease of early (168–189 milliseconds after stimulus onset) electrophysiological responses to negative and neutral faces localized within bilateral parahippocampal/insula and right temporo-occipital regions and a decrease of late (211–242 milliseconds after stimulus onset) electrophysiological responses to positive faces within the same regions Therefore, our study might have missed valence-specific effects because we used a blocked-design fMRI method, which has good spatial resolution but relatively low temporal resolution compared with electroencephalography (41). Future studies using time-varying stimulus conditions might further clarify this discrepancy The observed effects of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity in response to negative and neutral stimuli were lateralized to the right side. This finding is in accordance with recent evidence that SSRIs preferentially attenuate right amygdala responses to negative stimuli (42, 43). The preferential effect of SSRIs on the right amygdala might be attributable to genetic variations in the expression of serotonin transporters, as recent studies have revealed that genetic variations in the availability of serotonin transporters are associated with individual differences in right amygdala activity (8, 9). The notion that the right amygdala is particularly relevant to processing negative emotions is further supported by a study in patients undergoing surgery for treatment-resistant partial epilepsies (44), which reported that direct electrical stimulation of the right amygdala induced negative emotions, whereas stimulation of the left amygdala induced either positive or negative emotions. However, findings regarding lateralization of serotonergic effects on amygdala reactivity during emotion processing are still divergent (42, 43, 44), and a recent meta-analysis (10) reported similar effect size for the right and left amygdala. Therefore, the relevance of the observed lateralization effect remains inconclusive The complementary whole-brain analysis revealed that psilocybin decreased activation in the visual cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies (45, 46, 47) have shown that in the hallucinating brain, the visual cortex is in a state of hyperexcitability, leading to increased BOLD signals in the visual cortex due to internally generated neuronal excitation. It has been shown that a tonic increase of neuronal activity may actually decrease BOLD responses to external, task-related stimuli in the visual cortex (48). Therefore, the psilocybin-induced decrease of activation in the visual cortex might be related to hyperexcitability of neurons in the visual cortex and to visual perceptual alterations. This notion is supported by the recent studies of Kometer et al. (49, 50), which demonstrated that psilocybin decreased stimulus-induced responses in the visual cortex and the decrease correlated with the intensity of visual hallucinations. However, given that we evaluated a contrast (negative minus shapes—both of which included a visual stimulus) that decreased during psilocybin treatment in areas shown in Table 1 and given that psilocybin-induced decrease of activity in these regions was driven by decreased BOLD responses to negative stimuli but not by increased BOLD responses to the baseline condition, we cannot conclude that an increase of baseline activity in the visual cortex caused the observed BOLD decreases. Given the abundance of backprojections from the amygdala to the visual cortex that may modulate processing of threat-related signals in the visual cortex (51), we speculate that psilocybin-induced attenuation of amygdala activation might have reduced the activation that normally occurs in the visual cortex in response to threat-related visual stimuli. This notion is supported by an event-related fMRI study in patients with medial temporal lobe sclerosis (52) that showed amygdala lesions may attenuate activation of visual cortex in response to fearful stimuli. However, future connectivity studies are warranted to investigate the effects of psilocybin on emotion processing and amygdala reactivity in relation to distant brain regions. This notion is supported by a recent study of Hornboll et al. (53) reporting that ketanserin administration modulated amygdala-prefrontal coupling in response to fearful faces In addition to the effects on amygdala reactivity, psilocybin increased positive mood state, as evidenced by a pronounced increase in the PANAS positive affect subscore, but had no effect on negative mood state, as indicated by the PANAS negative affect subscore, or anxiety, as indicated by the STAI state score. Psilocybin is a mixed 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonist, and it has consistently been shown that the psychotropic effects of psilocybin are predominantly mediated by activation of 5-HT2A receptors (16, 17). Therefore, the finding that psilocybin acutely increased positive mood state is consistent with psilocybin-ketanserin blocking studies (19, 54) that showed the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist ketanserin completely blocked the mood-increasing effects of psilocybin. Notably, we found that the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state was related to the psilocybin-induced decrease in right amygdala reactivity. Given the dependence of psilocybin-induced mood changes on 5-HT2A receptors, these results indicate that 5-HT2A receptor stimulation critically underlies the observed effects of psilocybin on right amygdala reactivity Nevertheless, at the synaptic level, the mechanism by which 5-HT receptor stimulation leads to inhibition of the amygdala is not completely understood. Despite strong evidence that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is necessary to mediate the hallucinogen action of psilocybin (16, 17), psilocin, the bioactive metabolite of psilocybin, also activates 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors (55, 56). Serotonergic neurons originate in the brainstem raphe nuclei and release 5-HT at terminal nerve ends within projection areas, such as the amygdala (57, 58, 59). In the amygdala, both 5-HT1A (60, 61) and 5-HT2A receptors (62, 63, 64) are present in large quantities and are located on gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons that inhibit postsynaptic cell firing (65). Therefore, 5-HT receptor stimulation in the amygdala may indirectly inhibit amygdala reactivity via activation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors (61, 66). Given the critical role of 5-HT1A/2A receptors in mood (67, 68, 69) and anxiety disorders (70, 71, 72, 73) and given the abundance of postsynaptic 5-HT1A/2A receptors in the amygdala (59), the observed attenuation of amygdala reactivity might also have resulted from activation of either 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A postsynaptic receptors. The view that amygdala inhibition is mediated by 5-HT activation is supported by the observation that central 5-HT–deficient mice showed a higher level of amygdala/hippocampus-dependent fear conditioning than wild-type mice, and this was reversed by cerebral injection of 5-HT (74). Moreover, Catlow et al. (75) reported that psilocybin facilitated extinction of conditioned fear responses in the amygdala/hippocampus in mice, thus providing strong evidence of 5-HT1A/2A-related inhibition of amygdala/hippocampus reactivity. Finally, a combined positron emission tomography–fMRI study by Fisher et al. (76) demonstrated that 5-HT1A autoreceptor density in the brainstem region of the dorsal raphe nucleus accounted for 44% of the variability in right amygdala reactivity during emotion processing. In addition, given that psilocybin is also a 5-HT2C agonist (56), 5-HT2C activation might theoretically have contributed to the acute effects observed here. However, both animal (77) and human (78) studies have reported that acute 5-HT2C blockade, rather than 5-HT2C activation, may be anxiolytic, although psilocybin did not modulate state anxiety in this study. Therefore, we consider it rather implausible that 5-HT2C activation substantially contributed to the effects of psilocybin during emotion processing. In summary, substantial evidence indicates that an increase of serotonergic tone in the amygdala is a crucial mechanism underlying the acute effects of psilocybin. Therefore, it may be worth developing combined 5-HT1A/2A agonists that rapidly increase serotonergic neurotransmission in the amygdala, as available treatment options (e.g., SSRIs and buspirone) are inefficient, delayed, or associated with side effects (79, 80) In conclusion, our study investigated the neural substrates underlying the acute effects of psilocybin on emotion processing. We showed that acute treatment with psilocybin caused a marked decrease of amygdala reactivity in healthy volunteers and that this was related to an increase in positive mood state. These findings are in line with previous models of antidepressant action (34, 81, 82), which pose a decrease of amygdala reactivity as a necessary change associated with treatment response and remission from neuroaffective disturbance. Substantial support for the notion that psilocybin may have rapid antidepressant characteristics also comes from a recent clinical trial showing that in patients with depression and anxiety, a single dose of psilocybin improved mood and decreased anxiety for several months (27). However, despite this and previous evidence (18, 22, 24, 25, 26) of putative antidepressant effects, psilocybin might not show similar actions in patients with depression. Therefore, the effects of psilocybin on mood state and amygdala reactivity in patients with depression remain to be addressed in future clinical studies",
22,10.1177/0022167817709585,"A qualitative, thematic analysis performed on 6-month follow-up interview data in a recently completed clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD generated two major themes relating to how the treatment had been effective. Specifically, patients described the treatment as having driven a change from disconnection to connection, and from emotional avoidance to acceptance. Additionally, patients described previous treatments as being reinforcing of disconnection and avoidance, and so the psilocybin treatment was seen as a welcome and valuable alternative As will be detailed in a forthcoming formal study report (Carhart-Harris, 2017) average treatment effects were exceptionally large for the first 5 weeks and then dropped to levels associated with more conventional treatments at 3 and 6 months. Most patients still reported feeling some discernable benefits after 6 months, however, and all reported preferring psilocybin to conventional treatments they had previously tried and expressed an interest in further psilocybin therapy. None reported classic craving behavior in relation to psilocybin, consistent with evidence that psilocybin carries no recognizable addiction potential (Bogenschutz et al., 2015). There were also no reports of enduring psychoses, persisting “hallucinations,” or phenomena consistent with hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder Regarding the first change process, whereas the experience of depression was described as a sense of the world getting smaller until patients felt like they lived inside their minds, the psilocybin treatment was described as providing an experience of expansion: the mind “rebooted,” they were able to connect to their senses, others, and the outside world again. Such a rebooting process was often described as a “normalization” back to how they had been before the depression, rather than a hypomanic-like response Alongside this expansion outward, an “inner” expansion also seemed to have taken place: During dosing sessions, patients were able to accept rather than avoid painful feelings and memories, and reported a range of intense emotions. For many, a sense of openness to emotion persisted for months afterward, including long-term improvements in willingness to accept difficult memories and painful feelings, and also the capacity to feel compassion, love, and appreciation. This is consistent with previous findings of sustained increases in trait Openness in healthy volunteers after high dose psilocybin sessions (MacLean, Johnson, & Griffiths, 2011). The notion of an expanded “emotional repertoire” seems consistent with the length and descriptiveness of patients’ accounts of their experiences. The 17 who reported feeling significant drug effects during the dosing sessions gave far richer accounts of both their depression and psychedelic treatment than the three patients who did not have appreciable drug experiences Mechanistically, the above described “expansion” resonates with insights gleaned from recent neuroimaging and pharmacological studies of psychedelics. Psychedelics are known to stimulate serotonin receptors in the brain (the 2A subtype) that mediate flexible thinking (Boulougouris, Glennon, & Robbins, 2008; Carhart-Harris, Kaelen, et al., 2016; Kuypers et al., 2016). Moreover, acute brain imaging has suggested that the brain enters a hyperplastic state under psychedelics that may facilitate learning and change (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Carhart-Harris, Kaelen, et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris, Muthukumaraswamy, et al., 2016). Such a process can be likened to annealing in metallurgy, where a metal is heated in order to make it malleable. In this case, the metal is analogous to the mind and brain and the heat is the excitatory action of the psychedelic. In line with this analogy, future research is required to investigate how crucial psychological priming and environmental factors are in determining the short- and long-term effects of psychedelics. From the reports provided here, one suspects that drug × environment interactions are essential determiners of the quality of responses The processes of connection and acceptance have parallels to ideas from depth psychology: for example, Jungian notions of the collective unconscious, symbolism, archetypes and the shadow, and Freudian themes of the unconscious, dreamwork, abreaction, and catharsis. Maslow’s notions of self-actualization, and the assimilation of problematic experiences model (Stiles et al., 1990) are also relevant Initiatives to systematically examine the relative merits of different therapeutic approaches and environmental components (e.g., music) are currently being considered, and this work should ideally lead to a standardization of the therapeutic approach for psychedelic therapy. This process should help address present ambiguities about what psychedelic “psychotherapy” actually entails (see Fadiman, 2011; Goldsmith, 2011; Grof, 1980; Masters & Houston, 1966; Meckel Fisher, 2015, Richards, 2015; Stolaroff, 2004, for a variety of approaches) and what components are essential (or not) for maximizing positive therapeutic outcomes Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an approach that may be particularly complementary to the specific character of the psychedelic experience. ACT aims to improve “psychological flexibility” via six key processes, all of which resonate with the themes generated by patients in this study, that is, willingness to experience painful emotions, “defragging” rigid thought patterns, exploration/observation of experience, contact with the present moment, focusing on values, and committing to actions in the service of those values. There is a growing evidence base to suggest that ACT has long-term benefits for patients with depression (Forman, Herbert, Moitra, Yeomans, & Geller, 2007; Forman, Shaw, Goetter, Herbert, & Park, 2012). What ACT and depth psychology have in common is the focus on exploration, acceptance, and integration of painful experience and difficult emotions, rather than attempting to change those emotional states. Future research may be carried out to assess the possibility of using ACT in conjunction with psychedelics. Group therapy may also be complementary to psychedelics, as it aims to facilitate reconnection (Yalom & Leszcz, 2005) Patients in this study reported feeling disenchanted with traditional treatments for depression. Antidepressants and poorly delivered short-term talking therapies were seen as repeating and reinforcing the disconnection and emotional avoidance that they knew was a fundamental feature of their depression. For some, these treatments are seen as promoting a view of psychological pain as something that should be systematically suppressed, rather than explored as a symptom of an underlying problem that needs to be accessed and processed. Granted CBT and antidepressants have solid evidence bases of safety and efficacy (Pilling, Anderson, Goldberg, Meader, & Taylor, 2009); however, the patients in the current study appeared to value the opportunity the present treatment afforded them to access their emotional pain. This was described as cathartic for many, bringing tears of relief, and reports of feeling lighter and more open afterwards The novelty and potential antithetical nature of psychedelic therapy in relation to conventional talking and pharmacological therapies could be seen as a major positive, since it suggests that patients and clinicians may be granted a broader palette of treatment options in the future, affording them an opportunity to select a treatment that best suits the specific needs and/or desires of a given patient. Also, rather than viewing psychedelic treatment as competitive with conventional treatments, future studies may wish to examine the possibility of using psychedelic therapy as a possible catalyst of and/or supplement to these conventional treatments. For example, a psychedelic experience could be introduced at a strategic point within a standard 12-week course of CBT, with the intention of improving insight and motivation. A similar design was piloted in a recent psilocybin for tobacco addiction trial, with considerable success (Johnson et al., 2016) Focusing on limitations of psychedelic treatment, an alternative explanation for the replicable benefits reported by patients here is that the level of care and attention from the research team was exceptional, especially in relation to previous treatments they had received. This level of care will likely have enhanced transference relationships and the (perhaps implicit) desire of the patients to get well for their therapists. Expectation is known to play a role in determining treatment outcomes (Greenberg, Constantino, & Bruce, 2006; Visla, Constantino, Newkirk, Ogrodniczuk, & Söchting, 2016; Wampold, 2015; Wampold et al., 2005) and it is likely that many of the patients in this trial had positive expectations and/or experienced a positive modulation of their expectations in response to their intense drug experience(s) and the positive attention they received from their therapists. The researchers’ implicit positive regard toward the treatment may also have biased outcomes and patients may have easily gleaned the study demand characteristics and felt an implicit desire to confirm them. All these factors can and will be better controlled and tested in future studies assessing the efficacy of psychedelic therapy Regarding other biases, it is likely that there was a (self)-selection bias, that is, that patients sought out this trial because they were “believers” wanting to demonstrate that it could and would be effective for them. Moreover, since all of the patients had treatment-resistant depression, it is not surprising they held negative views about their previous unsuccessful treatments and were thus inclined to see a novel, unconventional intervention such as psilocybin, in a positive light. This probably does not account for how marked and enduring the positive outcomes were for many of the patients and how specific and consistent their criticisms were about past failed treatments. Nevertheless, the issue of selection bias must be better addressed in future trials, for example, by recruiting more patients through external referral mechanisms rather than self-referral, and measuring expectations at baseline and calculating their explanatory power The present article focuses on positive outcomes. However, this positive “bias” is a product of the data. The two positive change themes were the dominant themes expressed by the patients (see Table 1). Enquiries were made about negative outcomes of the treatment but comparatively little was offered in this respect. Previous qualitative analyses of patient-reported experiences of psychedelic treatment have found similarly positive regard for these interventions (Gasser et al., 2015; Belser et al., 2017). In the current study, a very small number of patients criticized some aspect of the way the therapists delivered the treatment (i.e., one did not warm to a specific guide and three wanted more therapeutic support posttreatment) but there was nothing substantial relating to the intervention itself. There were no serious adverse events reported during the dosing sessions or their aftermath Regarding specific cases, Patient 14 reported an apparent “reliving” of a childhood trauma. The therapy team felt it unwise to offer a judgment on whether this was a real memory or fantasy, however, and instead chose to treat it as psychologically interesting and worthy of discussion regardless of its veridicality. This ambiguity was initially uncomfortable for the patient, however, who hoped for an “expert answer” about whether what he had “seen” was true. This desire for closure subsided in time, however, as the patient talked through the incident with the study team. Another patient (P15) had a particularly intense high-dose session, becoming uncommunicative for a prolonged period (i.e., 2-3 hours) during the peak drug effects. The patient’s vital signs remained normal throughout, however, barely deviating from predrug baseline, and subsequent interviews revealed that this period had mostly been extremely “blissful” for the patient. For the therapy team, this putative mutism was concerning for a period; however, hindsight has taught us to simply sit out such situations (unless vital signs suggest otherwise), waiting for the idiosyncratic symptoms to subside. The positive physiological safety profile of psilocybin can offer reassurance in this regard There is a need for further qualitative research within studies assessing psychedelics for other indications, such as addiction (Bogenschutz & Johnson, 2016) and obsessive compulsive disorder (Moreno et al., 2006). Subthemes identified in the current study closely matched themes identified in previous qualitative analyses of psychedelic treatment studies, for example, “deschematizing and viewing experiences in another perspective,” “facilitated access to emotions and catharsis,” and “no negative aspects of the treatment” (Gasser et al., 2015); “relational embeddedness,” “emotional range,” and “desire to repeat the psilocybin experience” (Belser et al., 2017) It is notable that psychedelic treatment has been found to help a wide range of conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, smoking cessation, and end-of-life anxiety (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). It may be that psychedelics have an impact on certain fundamental processes that underlie many psychiatric conditions. Perhaps the diagnosed disorders represent different manifest expressions of consistent latent problems, such as repression of emotional pain and/or ego-dystonic psychological material (Freud, 1995), and/or a lack of meaning (Frankl, 1961) and/or disconnection from others (Bowlby, 1978). Thus, psychedelic research may help further our knowledge of core, root features of mental ill-being. Over the past 20 years, there has been an ever-increasing push in psychiatry to start promoting consideration of disease spectrums rather than distinct entities, and perhaps psychedelics could play a role in informing and improving the way we think about, and treat, mental illness, and wellness. It is inevitable that such a paradigmatic shift will meet resistance as it treads on the toes of convention, but its “success” may ultimately prove irresistible, if its foundations are strong Within the current medical model of mental illness, treatments are designed to mollify symptoms. However, in the present study, the benefit of treatment was not restricted to a reduction in symptomatology. When rumination started again after a few months, several patients still reported feeling better than before the treatment, claiming that there was greater meaning in their lives. For some, although scores on standard depression rating scales indicated treatment relapse, their comments during the 6-month interviews suggested major persistent changes in their perspectives and behaviors. This suggests that improved measures, more sensitive to changes in psychological well-being for example, should be considered to help capture and communicate real-world changes that are not adequately picked up by standard rating scales. It could be said that patients were not just losing symptoms of depression but were, in many cases, gaining happiness, which has been defined as “pleasure, engagement, and meaning” (Seligman, Parks, & Steen, 2004), Happiness, or psychological well-being, may be a valuable construct in this context. For example, it seemed that months after the psilocybin, patients were still able to benefit from the renewed meaning in their lives. To take one particular example from a patient whose depression had returned at the time of interview, she reported still feeling connected to what she described as her “inner teacher,” remained vegetarian (since the dosing session), and said that the trees continued to looked greener In conclusion, via thematic analysis applied to structured interviews performed 6 months after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression in 20 patients, we identified two major themes relating to how the treatment had been beneficial: (a) a change from disconnection (from the self, others, and the outside world) to connection and (b) a change from avoidance of difficult emotions and memories to acceptance. Provocatively, patients reported that previous treatments functioned to reinforce defensive strategies of disconnection/retreat and avoidance, whereas treatment with psilocybin promoted a confrontation and subsequent reconnection that was lasting in many cases. The approach taken here complements more formal, quantitative analyses of the utility of psilocybin (Carhart-Harris, Bolstridge, et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris, 2017; Gasser et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016) and should help inform and enrich understanding of this novel treatment and its mechanisms of action, helping generate new hypotheses that can be tested in subsequent research",
23,10.1177/0269881114568039,"We failed to find any associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and past year serious psychological distress, receiving or needing mental health treatment, depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts or behavior in the past year. Rather, lifetime use of psychedelics was associated with decreased inpatient psychiatric treatment. In addition to not being significantly different from no association, in all cases the calculated aORs were small (for all, psychedelic use aOR < 1.2) Stratifying by age, gender, past year illicit drug use or childhood depressive episode did not substantially change the results of any of the logistic regression analyses. Likewise, lifetime use of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline or peyote, or past year use of LSD was not associated with a higher rate of mental health problems Most claims about the harms from psychedelics have been based on theoretical assumptions and case reports, which should be evaluated with caution. See our earlier population study of mental health among psychedelic users for further discussion about case reports and previous studies (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b In particular, our previous population study (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b) did not support either the idea of ‘flashbacks’, described in extreme cases as recurrent psychotic episodes, hallucinations, or panic attacks, or the more recent ‘hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder’ (HPPD), described as persistent visual phenomena with accompanying anxiety and distress, since lifetime use of psychedelics and past year use of LSD was not associated with past year symptoms of visual phenomena (‘seeing something others could not’), panic attacks, psychosis or overall serious psychological distress. Recent randomized controlled trials with psilocybin have not reported any cases of flashbacks or persistent visual phenomena (Griffiths et al., 2008, 2011; Studerus et al., 2011). Interviews with over 500 regular participants in Native American peyote ceremonies did not identify anyone with flashbacks or persistent visual symptoms (Halpern et al., 2005). Occasional visual phenomena are common in the general population, and all of the symptoms included in the purported HPPD are also present in people who have never used psychedelics. A recent study of 120 US adults troubled by HPPD-like persistent visual symptoms found a lower than average rate of psychedelic use (Schankin et al., 2014). Overall, the validity of the HPPD diagnosis remains scant. HPPD may fit within the somatic symptom disorders. For further discussion, see Our results might reflect beneficial effects of psychedelic use, relatively better initial mental health among people who use psychedelics or chance ‘false positive’ findings. However, it is well documented that psychedelics elicit spiritual experiences. Indeed, long-term psychological benefits have been reported in several clinical trials of LSD, for example, ‘About half of the total sample felt they had achieved more understanding and acceptance of themselves and a broader tolerance of the view points of others via the LSD experience’ (McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971). In a recent randomized controlled trial of psilocybin, most of the participants (67%) regarded the experience as one of the most personally significant moments in their lives (comparable to the birth of a first child) (Griffiths et al., 2006) and, furthermore, most of the participants (64%) reported improved well-being or life satisfaction 14 months later (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008; MacLean et al., 2011). People often report long-term benefits from LSD use (Morgan et al., 2010). No serious adverse events have been reported in recent randomized controlled trials of psilocybin, demonstrating that psychedelics can be administered safely in medical contexts (Griffiths et al., 2008, 2011; Johnson et al., 2008; Studerus et al., 2011). Case–control and longitudinal studies have not found evidence of increased mental health problems among people who have used traditional psychedelics (peyote or ayahuasca) hundreds of times in legally recognized religious ceremonies (Bouso et al., 2012; Halpern et al., 2005) This study had a retrospective, cross-sectional design, making it impossible to draw causal inferences. Many potentially important risk factors, such as family mental health history, were not available. Longitudinal data were not available on mental health or other factors before psychedelic use. We cannot exclude the possibility that use of psychedelics might have a negative effect on mental health for some individuals or groups, which might be counterbalanced at a population level by a positive effect on mental health for others. People who choose to use psychedelics might have better initial mental health before using psychedelics, and people who experience problems apparently related to psychedelics may choose to not use them again. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons, so some of the associations with weak statistical significance are likely due to chance. Screening questions, rather than diagnostic interviews, were used as symptom indicators. We did not have data on setting of use or factors that might influence the experience of psychedelics. The study also relied on self-reports of drug use. Participants’ answers to the questions on behaviors and mental health could be influenced by memory errors and under-reporting; however, a 14-year longitudinal study reported good consistency over time in reporting of LSD use (Johnston and O’Malley, 1997). Use of dimethyltryptamine (DMT), found in the shamanic brew ayahuasca, could not be determined from the data set; however, recent studies of people who have used ayahuasca hundreds of times have not detected evidence of problems (Bouso et al., 2012). Dosage and purity of street drugs is often unknown and, in particular, substances sold as mescaline often contain LSD or other substances (Laing and Siegel 2003). A small group (< 2%) of US adults in prison, hospital or military service was not included in the NSDUH sampling This study did not find any associations between psychedelic use and increased likelihood of past year suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts. Rather, among people with childhood depression, those who had used psychedelics had lower likelihood of past year suicidal thoughts and plans There is little evidence linking psychedelic use to later suicide. A study of 178 adolescents with psychosis reported that suicide attempt was more likely among those who had used LSD, but there was no adjustment for other factors and it was not recorded whether the suicide attempt occurred before or after LSD use (Shoval et al., 2006). A case–control study of 96 adolescents with depression reported that suicide attempt was more likely among those with hallucinogen abuse or dependence, but ‘hallucinogen’ was not defined and likely included drugs such as MDMA and PCP, there was little adjustment for other factors, and it was not recorded whether the suicide attempt occurred before or after hallucinogen use (Kelly et al., 2002 In the past, some people seem to have assumed that taking psychedelics, or indeed engaging in any introspective practice, could lead to depression and suicide because of the supposedly disturbing and disappointing nature of self-knowledge (Evang, 1968); however, there now seems to be greater acceptance of introspective practices (such as ‘mindfulness’ or meditation) among the public and mental health professionals. In a small number of publicized cases, relatives or anti-psychedelic campaigners have blamed an individual’s suicide on prior psychedelic use, without evidence of any clear connection. For instance, in 1909 a Native American peyote church member killed himself (Stewart, 1987), and his death was then cited as evidence against peyote; in the 1960s there were a few cases where relatives blamed a suicide on prior LSD use (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2005). In surveys of US, Canadian and British physicians who administered LSD to thousands of psychiatric patients in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a small number of suicides and suicide attempts were reported (in people with prior suicide attempt or serious mental illness) in the year or so after taking a dose of LSD (Canada Department of National Health and Welfare, 1973; Cohen 1960; Malleson 1971; US Senate, Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization, 1968). Based on these and other studies, the rate of adverse events following clinical treatment with LSD was considered to be similar to that expected among psychiatric patients in general, and overall LSD was considered to have acceptable safety for clinical use When evaluating case reports of suicide in psychedelic users, it is important to note that suicide is one of the most common causes of death in the general population: approximately two out of every 100 people in the US will die by suicide (CDC, 2013). Cases of suicide or death due to other causes during the direct effects of psychedelics are extremely rare, despite the fact that millions of doses are consumed annually (EMCDDA, 2011). It is of note that many of the stories from 50 years ago about death or injury of people while on LSD appear to be unsubstantiated urban legends Concern about psychedelic use seems to have been based on media sensationalism, lack of information and cultural biases, rather than evidence-based harm assessments. As examples of cultural biases, a 1967 case series of five university students with ‘prolonged adverse reactions’ to peyote consisted of a homosexual student who started a relationship with another male student, a student with pre-existing depression who wanted to travel to India and study Eastern religions, a student who left school and became a ‘beatnik’, a student who was prompted to seek psychotherapy for pre-existing social anxiety and paranoia about homosexuals, and an engineering student who had visions while falling asleep and eventually took a break from school to do volunteer work (Kleber, 1967). There was a common view in the early 20th century that mystical or transcendent experiences were, almost by definition, delusional and anti-scientific, and that self-exploration without the supervision of a trained therapist was dangerous (Evang, 1968; Hayman, 1964). While discussing psychedelics, psychiatrist Max Hayman wrote, ;The practices of the Christian mystics constitute one of the most tragic chapters of human history… Science is the path we have chosen to aid in man’s growth and development, and mysticism in whatever guise is a contaminant of the scientific attitude’ (Hayman, 1964). In an influential 1966 Time magazine interview, psychiatrist Sidney Cohen, one of the most prominent critics of the emerging psychedelic culture, commented on his own LSD experience: ‘I got a massive jolt that I’ll never forget. I got a chance to really look at myself, and I didn’t like some of the things I saw’ (Time, 1966) The original World Health Organization (WHO) assessment of psychedelics, prepared for the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, claimed that psychedelics caused a list of problems; however, the references cited included no evidence of harm from psilocybin, mescaline or DMT, and only a small number of case reports and anecdotes of possibly LSD-related adverse effects (Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970; WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, 1969). Central to the argument for international restrictions on psychedelics was the claim that psychedelics caused a special ‘LSD-type’ dependence, defined as ‘periodic’ use amongst ‘arty-type’ people (Eddy et al., 1965; Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970; WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, 1969). Psychedelics were claimed to have ‘high abuse potential’ simply because there were reports of their use (Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970). The WHO report acknowledged that LSD and other psychedelics ‘are usually taken in the hope of inducing a mystical experience leading to a greater understanding of the users’ personal problems and of the universe’ and that people diagnosed with mental disorders following psychedelic use ‘are generally believed to have been persons who were “predisposed” to psychiatric disease’ (Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970) As noted recently by the British Medical Association (BMA), ‘The cultural and social attitudes surrounding illegal drugs mean that their classification and legal status do not directly relate to the health risks they pose to users and communities’ (BMA, 2012). A 1970 assessment of LSD by the UK Home Office acknowledged that use of LSD and other psychedelics was a sincere spiritual practice, noting, ‘We have been content to accept the sincerity of those of our witnesses who claimed that some people have reached a greater awareness and insight into their own problems and, indeed, into the meaning of life itself, through their use of LSD’. The UK assessment explained that ‘there is a presumption in favour of allowing adult men and women to consume whatever substances they please, but this presumption must be overridden in circumstances in which such freedom results in a serious danger to public health… [Evidence for which] would have to be kept under continual review in the light of rapidly developing scientific knowledge and accelerating social change’ (Home Office, Department of Health and Social Security, 1970). The only epidemiological data on non-clinical use of LSD included in the UK assessment was a table showing that 127 people who were admitted to UK psychiatric hospitals in 1966–1968 had reported having tried LSD at some point, not necessarily related to the hospital visit (Home Office, Department of Health and Social Security, 1970); these cases were a surely a tiny fraction of total psychiatric admissions or total LSD users at that time. We failed to find, in this study or in our previous population study, evidence linking past year LSD use to increased likelihood of inpatient mental health treatment (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b) A 1975 report from the US National Institute of Mental Health noted that people who use LSD ‘repetitively in a social pattern’ ‘cannot be characterized by any specific psychiatric label’ and called for more ‘scientific study of hallucinogen-derived mystical experiences… described as powerful and sometimes transforming’ (Segal, 1975). A 1968 US Senate report on LSD policy noted that all expert witnesses were opposed to criminalizing LSD use and concluded: ‘The tardy reaction of the Government was rash and excessive, resulting in the termination of almost all research… As protector of the public safety and supporter to medical research, the Government had an obligation to maintain a balanced perspective concerning LSD at a time of public tumult. It failed to do so’ (US Senate Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization, 1968). LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and several other psychedelics are included in Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970; these substances were simply placed in Schedule I by Congress without an evidence-based assessment to determine whether LSD and other psychedelics met criteria to be added to Schedule I. There may have been a political rather than public health rationale behind the criminalization of psychedelic users. It is deeply troubling to read an interview with John Ehrlichman, advisor to US President Richard Nixon, in which he explains that the War on Drugs was ‘really about’ hurting ‘the antiwar Left, and black people’, and openly admits, ‘Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did’ (Baum, 2012)","The results of this study are consistent with our previous population study, early and recent randomized controlled trials, studies of regular participants in legally recognized psychedelic religious ceremonies, drug education materials from public agencies and recent expert assessments of drug harms (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b). There is little evidence linking psychedelic use to lasting mental health problems. In general, use of psychedelics does not appear to be particularly dangerous when compared to other activities considered to have acceptable safety. It is important to take a statistical perspective to risk, rather than focusing on case reports and anecdotes: ‘Nothing in life is free from risk – risk is simply impossible to avoid… Even ordinary activities – eating breakfast, watching television, walking the dog – carry risks, however minor’ (BMA, 2012). As Steven Pinker recently noted, ‘In a free society, one cannot empower the government to outlaw any behavior that offends someone just because the offendee can pull a hypothetical future injury out of the air’ (Pinker, 2008). Overall, it is difficult to see how prohibition of psychedelics can be justified from a public health or human rights perspective."
24,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3285,"This randomized clinical trial documented the substantial rapid and enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy among patients with MDD. Although the rapid antidepressant effects of psilocybin are similar to those reported with ketamine,10,11 the therapeutic effects are different: ketamine effects typically last for a few days to 2 weeks, whereas the current study showed that clinically significant antidepressant response to psilocybin therapy persisted for at least 4 weeks, with 71% of the participants continuing to show a clinically significant response (≥50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score) at week 4 of follow-up. Furthermore, psilocybin was found to have low potential for addiction22 and a minimal adverse event profile,22,23 suggesting therapeutic advantages with less risk for associated problems than ketamine.12 The present findings in patients with MDD are consistent with results of studies that reported on the effectiveness of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing antidepressant effects among patients with cancer who had psychological distress16,17,47 and a small open-label study of patients with treatment-resistant depression The mounting evidence of the use of psilocybin as an adjunct to treatment of a variety of psychiatric conditions (eg, depression,16-18 tobacco use disorder,48 and alcohol use disorder49) suggests a transdiagnostic mechanism of action. In several studies in patients16-18,49-51 and in healthy volunteers,32,52 the intensity of mystical-type experiences reported after psilocybin sessions was associated with favorable outcomes. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies have suggested that mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences during a psychedelic session predict positive therapeutic effects.53-55 Consistent with these previous studies, the current trial showed that psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type, personally meaningful, and insightful experiences were associated with decreases in depression at 4 weeks (eResults in Supplement 2). Furthermore, a recent report suggested that psilocybin may decrease negative affect and the neural correlates of negative affect,56 which may be a mechanism underlying transdiagnostic efficacy. Taken together, these findings suggest that further studies into psychological and neural mechanisms across different psychiatric conditions are warranted The present trial showed that psilocybin administered in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours) produced large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects. The effect sizes reported in this study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy57 and more than 4 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychopharmacological depression treatment studies.58 These findings are consistent with literature that showed that combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy were more efficacious in the treatment of MDD than either intervention alone.59-61 Furthermore, given that psilocybin was associated with nonserious adverse effects that were frequently reported as mild-to-moderate headache and challenging emotions that were limited to the time of sessions (eTables 8 and 9 in Supplement 2), this intervention may be more acceptable to patients than widely prescribed antidepressant medications that confer substantially more problematic effects (eg, suicidal ideation, decrease in sexual drive, and weight gain). The effectiveness of psilocybin therapy after a single or only a few administrations represents another substantial advantage over commonly used antidepressants that require daily administration This study has some strengths. It had a randomized design and used GRID-HAMD as the primary outcome measure that was assessed by blinded clinician raters. The delayed treatment condition controlled for the possible effects of having been accepted into the trial and for the passage of time between screening and initial follow-up assessments. However, the delayed treatment condition did not control for other aspects of psilocybin administration, such as preparation and rapport building, postsession integration meetings, or expectancy effects. Although placebo and active treatment controlled designs are widely used in therapeutic trials,62 they too have limitations owing to the highly discriminable effects of psilocybin This study has some other limitations. It had a short-term follow-up, a small sample that was predominantly composed of White non-Hispanic participants, and included participants with low risk of suicide and moderately severe depression. Further research with larger and more diverse samples, longer-term follow-up, and a placebo control is needed to better ascertain the safety (eg, abuse potential of psilocybin, suicide risk, and emergence of psychosis) and efficacy of this intervention among patients with MDD. Another limitation is the psychotherapy approach31 that involved session facilitators from a variety of professional disciplines (eg, social work, psychology, psychiatry) and session facilitators without formal clinical training (eg, research assistants and clinical trainees). The type of psychotherapy offered and the characteristics of therapists should be explored in future studies.","Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects among patients with MDD. These data expand the findings of previous studies involving patients with cancer and depression as well as patients with treatment-resistant depression by suggesting that psilocybin may be effective in the much larger population of MDD. Further studies are needed with active treatment or placebo controls and in larger and more diverse populations."
25,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.11.010,"Contemporary therapeutic research with classic psychedelics has shown promising effects for both cancer-related psychological distress, and addiction to both tobacco and alcohol. In addition, basic scientific studies using classic psychedelics have led to numerous advances in the experimental study of mystical experiences and the study of classic psychedelic mechanisms of action. Perhaps most importantly, neurobiological studies of the effects of classic psychedelics have yielded insights into the biological basis of consciousness. Specifically, these studies collectively suggest the possibility that the pattern and structure of communication between brain networks constitutes the neurobiological basis of consciousness, such that alterations of consciousness are driven by alterations of communication between brain regions. Interestingly, large-scale epidemiological studies of naturalistic classic psychedelic use are consistent with contemporary clinical research, and point to intriguing future trends, namely the application of classic psychedelics in forensic setting Promising recent results have been published for cancer-related psychological distress, using both psilocybin and LSD, replicating one major focus of the earlier era of classic psychedelic research. Many of these studies have shown such findings using rigorous double-blind procedures that vary in methods. Consistent signals of efficacy in the face of such variations suggest a robust clinical response. In the United States, if future phase 3 research supports these preliminary findings showing the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of cancer-related psychological distress, non-research therapeutic use of psilocybin, under appropriately restricted safeguards adhering to strict safety standards (Johnson et al., 2008), may eventually warrant regulatory approval. Additionally, pilot research on treatment-resistant depression also shows preliminary promise in response to classic psychedelic treatment outside of the context of cancer. If such findings are demonstrated in randomized studies, classic psychedelics may be poised as breakthrough medications for the leading cause of worldwide disability, affecting over 300 million human beings (World Health Organization, 2017). Although the clinical research agenda on addictions is at a lesser stage of development in comparison to cancer-related psychological distress, with only open-label pilot studies having been completed thus far in contemporary research (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2014), if randomized clinical trials continue to suggest safety and efficacy, clinical approval of the use of psilocybin for the treatment of specific addiction may also be on the horizon If safety and efficacy are sufficiently demonstrated to warrant approved therapeutic use of one classic psychedelic (e.g., psilocybin, LSD), this would suggest the potential therapeutic potential of additional compounds of the same class. In the typical clinical development of other drug classes (e.g., benzodiazepines), a seminal compound of the class is identified and developed for therapeutic use (e.g., chlordiazepoxide), followed by the discovery and therapeutic development of additional compounds of the class over the subsequent decades. However, the clinical development of classic psychedelics may be unique, in that hundreds of psychoactive compounds related to this class have already been identified (e.g., Shulgin and Shulgin, 1991; Shulgin and Shulgin, 1997). Therefore, the broad array of classic and novel psychedelic compounds that have been universally ignored in pharmaceutical drug development may soon constitute a library of potential therapeutics. They may also help to inform the biological mechanisms of human consciousness.",
26,10.1007/s00213-015-4162-0,"By exploring the effects of ayahuasca intake on mindfulness capacities, the present study aimed to better understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca. Our findings indicate that ayahuasca intake leads to a rapid increase in several mindfulness-related parameters. Two FFMQ facets changed after ayahuasca, suggesting a decrease in the judgmental processing of personal experiences, along with a reduction in inner reactivity. Additionally, decentering ability was also increased after ayahuasca intake. These combined modifications provide an explanatory mechanism that could contribute to the beneficial effects reported for ayahuasca in the treatment of addiction and depression (Thomas et al. 2013; Osório et al. 2015). It is worth mentioning that prior studies showing benefits associated with long-term ayahuasca use have the confounding factor of participants being members of a religious group (Fábregas et al. 2010; Bouso et al. 2012). The present results obtained in a lay setting support the notion that ayahuasca may have therapeutic potential per se in the absence of the religion confound The scores in some mindfulness capacities observed after ayahuasca are analogous to those of experienced meditators (Soler et al. 2014a). Thus, Soler and colleagues report the following average scores in their experienced meditator sample: “Non-react”, 24.84; “Non-judge”, 30.61; EQ, 41.07; and MINDSENS, 3.70. These values are very close and in some cases lower than those obtained here in the post-ayahuasca assessment “Non-react”, 25.56; “Non-judge”, 33.16; EQ, 41.41; MINDSENS, 3.66. The similar values obtained in the MINDSENS are a relevant finding. The MINDSENS index was created with those FFMQ and EQ items that were more sensitive to meditation practice. This index is sensitive to several aspects of meditation practice, i.e., to the overall years of practice and to the frequency and length of meditative sessions (Soler et al. 2014a). Our study indicates that improvements in mindfulness capacities are not exclusive of mindfulness meditation practice, as they can also be obtained by a pharmacological intervention Our results showed that not all mindfulness facets are equally affected by ayahuasca. Analogously, previous studies comparing meditators vs. non-meditators suggested that not all mindfulness facets are equally modified by practice. For example, in a study comparing a large sample of meditators (n = 384) to individuals without meditative experience (n = 286), the first group scored significantly higher in all FFMQ facets and decentering. However, certain facets such as “Observe”, “Non-react”, and “Decentering” appear to be more sensitive than the others to formal meditation practice (Soler et al. 2014a, b). Increased ability to “Observe” has been pointed out as essential capacity of meditating individuals (Lilja et al. 2012). Out of the five facets of the FFMQ, significant changes were observed in the “Non-judge” and “Non-react” facets Mindfulness is considered a two-factor construct comprising both attentional and attitudinal elements (Bishop et al. 2004). The “Non-judge” and “Non-react” subscales are considered to measure acceptance (Baer et al. 2006). Thus, ayahuasca would particularly foster acceptance of the thoughts and feelings experienced by the individual. This increased self-acceptance could contribute to the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca, as suggested by Thomas (Thomas et al. 2013). Indeed, a state of increased self-acceptance would be clinically useful, since the attitudinal component of mindfulness, rather than the attentional, appears to be particularly impaired in patients with psychopathology (Coffey et al. 2010; Tejedor et al. 2014) The ayahuasca experience may induce an introspective exposure to emotional memories (Riba et al. 2001, 2006), similar to that used in emotional reprocessing interventions (Foa et al. 1995). As intended in such interventions, the use of ayahuasca may promote a detached relationship with one’s own emotions. This detached manner of approaching the inner experience has been defined as “decentering” or “defusion”, understood as the metacognitive ability to take a detached view of one’s own thoughts and emotions. It allows patients to consider thoughts and emotions as objective temporary events of the mind, rather than statements that are necessarily true (Fresco et al. 2007a) Deficits in decentering have been postulated as a trans-diagnostic index of psychopathology. Compared to healthy controls, it is diminished in individuals with cocaine use disorders, eating disorders, major depression, and borderline personality disorder (Soler et al. 2014a). Increases in decentering have been observed after cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and also after mindfulness-based interventions (Bliss and McCardle 2013; Hayes-skelton et al. 2014). Similar to a study in which increases in decentering were reported in a group of patients responding to antidepressant treatment (Fresco et al. 2007b), our data show that psychotropic substances, in our case ayahuasca, can also enhance this ability. Increases in this capacity would explain findings suggesting that ayahuasca has therapeutic effects in depression (Sanches et al. 2015; Osório et al. 2015), a disorder in which the decentering capacity is impaired (Teasdale et al. 2002; Segal et al. 2006; Carmody et al. 2009 Our results are in line with the recent research exploring the therapeutic potential of other psychedelic 5-HT2A agonists, substances which in recent years are receiving renewed attention in psychiatry (Sessa and Johnson 2015). For instance, psilocybin was safely administered to advanced-stage cancer patients and proved effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms related to illness (Grob et al. 2011). Promising results have also been reported for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), another classic psychedelic (Gasser et al. 2014). From a mechanistic perspective, these drugs show modulatory activity on the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex following acute administration (Vollenweider and Kometer 2010; Kraehenmann et al. 2014). These areas are key structures of the emotional brain and their function is deregulated in affective disorders (Pezawas et al. 2005). Regular use of psychedelics has also been associated with differences in brain structure relative to non-users. In a study assessing long-term ayahuasca users, the authors found thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key hub of the default mode network (Raichle et al. 2001). Thinning in the PCC inversely correlated with prior use of ayahuasca and with scores on self-transcendence (Bouso et al. 2015). This personality trait, which comprises religiousness, spirituality, and transpersonal feelings, was higher in ayahuasca-using subjects. No differences were found with controls with regard to neuropsychological functioning or indicators of psychopathology. This finding suggested that regular ayahuasca use may lead to default mode network deactivation, which is overactive in depression (Sheline et al. 2010). Analogously, conventional mindfulness practice also has an impact on the default mode network (Taylor et al. 2013), indicating further commonalities between the ayahuasca experience and mindfulness training. Although to our knowledge, studies with other psychedelics have not specifically examined modifications in mindfulness capacities, it is possible that psilocybin and LSD also show these facilitating effects. Future studies with these substances should explore this possibility The current findings should be taken as preliminary, as the study was intended as exploratory and has some limitations that need to be considered. First, the characteristics of the participant sample and its relatively limited size could be biasing our results. Prior exposure to ayahuasca may have led to a ceiling effect, as suggested by the increases in significance obtained in the repeated measures ANCOVA for “Non-Judge” and “Non-react” subscales. On the other hand, it can be argued that the fact that a single ayahuasca dose increases mindfulness capacities in experienced users who were already more “mindful” than the general population (as shown for instance by the EQ pre-administration values), underscores the power of ayahuasca to enhance these abilities even when the baseline level is high. Although participants manifested being free of any current psychiatric or medical condition, no rigorous criteria were applied to exclude subjects with past diagnoses of mental disorders. The absence of a control group also limits the generalization of the present findings. However, FFMQ facets and decentering appear to be stable over time (Veehof et al. 2011; Soler et al. 2014b). This makes it unlikely that our results are due to natural fluctuations of these variables, rather than the consequence of ayahuasca intake. Lastly, only one dose of ayahuasca was ingested, although the subjective effects of ayahuasca are dose-dependent (Riba et al. 2001). Future studies should explore the impact of different doses and be conducted using randomized controlled designs In summary, the present study provides evidence supporting the claim that ayahuasca has therapeutic potential. The present findings additionally suggest that this is due to increases in mindfulness-related capacities. Further research is warranted to corroborate these results, to test whether the benefits induced by ayahuasca on mindfulness capacities are maintained over time. Positive results would argue strongly in favor of conducting studies involving psychiatric populations.",
27,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.03.010,"This article has revisited the so-called entropic brain hypothesis (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). It has cited increasing empirical support for the idea since it was originally published in early 2014 (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014) and highlighted a particularly promising measure of brain entropy, Lempel-Ziv, that has proved to be informative about conscious level in disorders of consciousness (Casali et al., 2013), pharmacologically induced loss of consciousness (Schartner et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2001) and psychedelic-induced consciousness ‘enrichment’ (Schartner et al., 2017). It has attempted to tackle the question of what increased entropy in the brain relates to in terms of conscious experience, proposing that richness of conscious experience, information content and subjective uncertainty are all close relatives - if not direct counterparts - of increased brain entropy (at least within a critical zone). Specific challenges for the entropic brain theory, and ideas about how it may be tested and advanced, were discussed. Two specific examples were provided of how the entropic brain might be clinically applied, i.e. through using psychedelics to facilitate emotional insight and/or treat disorders of consciousness. The former may be likened to the use of free-association in psychoanalysis, where an open, free-flowing mindstate is encouraged so that the liklihood of spontaneous insight is enhanced. Closing sections focused on properties of criticality in the brain and how these may be accentuated under psychedelics (Atasoy et al., 2017) as well as recent advances in serotonin research that chime well with the entropic brain and may be usefully combined with it to solve a major riddle in psychopharmacology, namely what is brain serotonin for? The proposed solution being: to differentially encode behavioural responses to uncertainty. See (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) for a more focused discussion of this matter Like the original entropic brain paper (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), this updated version can be considered speculative and forward looking. This approach is vulnerable to critique (Papo, 2016) but may also be a strength. It is worth reflecting that the major arguments and hypotheses of the original entropic brain paper have stood up well to empirical scrutiny, e.g. that brain entropy is enhanced under psychedelics (Lebedev et al., 2016; Schartner et al., 2017; Tagliazucchi et al., 2014; Viol et al., 2017) and that the ‘psychedelic-brain’ exhibits more pronounced signatures of criticality than normal waking consciousness (Atasoy et al., 2017) It may be noted however, that some of the themes and terminology used in the original paper, e.g. ‘primary and secondary consciousness’, ‘the ego’ and the default-mode network, have been omitted from the present contribution. There is no conscious agenda behind this, other than a desire to focus on the most pertinent and timely topics, done in the interests of parsimony and concision. What is left out of the present paper should not be considered ‘retracted’ but rather side-stepped for the time being, in the interests of expediency. It should be clearly stated however, that the position that psychedelic research offers a unique opportunity for major principles of psychoanalytic theory to be tested, verified and revived is still very much maintained. There is a door ajar here for psychoanalytically-minded experimental psychologists and neuroscientists to open and walk through “Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” (Carl Jung)“These substances [psychedelics] function as unspecific amplifiers that increase the energetic niveau in the psyche and make the deep unconscious dynamics available for conscious processing. This unique property of psychedelics makes it possible to study psychological undercurrents that govern our experiences and behaviors to a depth that cannot be matched by any other methods and tools available in modern mainstream science.” (Stanislav Grof) Briefly, one specific hypothesis contained in the original paper (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014) that has not stood the test of time, can now be revised, namely that the brain during seizure is sub-critical in relation to normal waking consciousness; in fact, evidence suggests it is super-critical (Meisel et al., 2012) – which, with the benefit of hindsight, makes much more sense About the specific limitations of the present paper, it has been selective in its focus, and unlike the original (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), has said little about other altered states of consciousness in which entropy may be elevated above the normal waking baseline. Befitting its richer content and emotional tone, it has been shown that REM sleep is more entropic than NREM sleep (Abasolo et al., 2015; Burioka et al., 2005) but what about psychosis? The variegated nature of this disorder means we must be cautious about making too general and therefore misleading statements about it. For example, we can speculate that whereas entropy/uncertainty/content may be elevated in manic states (e.g. see Thomasson et al., 2002) and early and acute psychotic episodes, it may be suppressed once a fixed delusion has formed – and/or an antipsychotic and/or mood-stabilising medication is introduced and becomes effective – for example see (Méndez et al., 2012) for evidence of decreased brain entropy after treatment with mirtazapine for depression Also, while the literature is replete with studies applying entropy/complexity measures to EEG data recorded in the context of anaesthetics and sedatives, it is surprisingly difficult to find studies in which the same measures have been applied to EEG data recorded after acute administration of a stimulant (although see - Sun et al., 2007). Stimulants would be particularly interesting controls for psychedelics, in terms of demonstrating the specificity of the proposed relationship between brain entropy and richness of conscious experience and subjective uncertainty. Until such comparisons are made, it is not possible to reject the possibility that brain entropy is merely an index of “alertness” or “arousal” – as has been suggested previously (Mateos et al. 2018) – although indirect evidence tentatively suggests that this alternative explanation is not compelling (Sun et al., 2007; Liu et al., 1997; Zarjam et al., 2012). It seems more reasonable to suppose however, that altered states of consciousness induced by non-serotonergic psychedelics, deliriants and/or dissociatives, that share some of the phenomenological features the classic serotonergic psychedelics, e.g. enriched and changeable contents of consciousness and a sense of uncertainty, might also exhibit heightened entropic brain activity, as was recently demonstrated with the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine for example (Schartner et al., 2017) Another limitation of the present paper is that although explicit mention has been given to the Lempel-Ziv measure (Schartner et al., 2015), only general statements about it have been made - for greater detail see (Schartner et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2001). For example, perhaps there are reasons to focus on the compressibility of signals detected from specific spatial locations when studying specific subjective phenomena (e.g. occipital sensors and visual phenomena) or to improve the temporal precision of our sampling so as to more accurately map between neurophysiological and phenomenological events or epochs – as discussed above. It is hoped that more nuanced hypotheses arising from the entropic brain theory can be tested in the future Relatedly, brain entropy has been treated here as a global brain phenomenon but there are reasons to be believe that spatial localisation is relevant to both the action of psychedelics and the neurobiology of consciousness. For example, the serotonin 2A receptors that appear to be the key trigger receptors for the psychedelic experience (Nichols, 2016) have their densest expression in high-level cortical regions belonging to the default-mode network (Beliveau et al. 2017) and this network, as well as other fronto-parietal networks, have been closely implicated in consciousness regulation (Guldenmund et al., 2016) – as they have in the psychedelic state (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016b; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b) Another key issue deserving of focus before closing, is the matter of the relationship between entropy and criticality. It seems reasonable to infer that such a relationship exists but nothing specific has yet been said about this. Is it more accurate to describe the psychedelic brain as ‘critical’ or ‘dynamically instable’ than ‘entropic’? Is there a limit to the rule that increased brain entropy relates to increased richness of conscious content? The answer to this last question is “probably yes”, and more specifically, it seems likely that there is a zone of criticality (Moretti and Munoz, 2013) above which any further increases in brain entropy create a state of mind and brain that is incapable of integrating information into coherent ‘wholes’ (Gallimore, 2015). Anecdotal reports of complete and/or near-complete loss of consciousness under psychedelics can be found (https://erowid.org/experiences/) but are rare. Thus, generally speaking, the entropic brain principle, that increased brain entropy relates to an increased richness of conscious experience, may be said to stand, but only within an upper as well as a lower limit (Fig. 1). It is interesting to reflect that identifying the point at which conscious awareness is lost with psychedelics may be informative about consciousness itself - in the same way that anaesthetic-induced loss of consciousness has been well used to study consciousness so effectively. Questions about the ethics and safety of giving sufficiently high enough doses of psychedelics to achieve loss of consciousness may preclude this work from ever being done however - at least for the foreseeable future; although potent short-acting psychedelics such as DMT and 5-MeO-DMT may help surmount this issue. Another intriguing question is whether so-called “access consciousness” is more readily lost than “phenomenal consciousness” (Block, 2005) in the extreme, high-entropy psychedelic state Finally, but importantly, it must be conceded that applying entropy measures to brain physiology is not a new endeavour (Klonowski et al., 1999; Nandrino et al., 1994; Papo, 2016; Zhang et al., 2001) and theories on the relationship between brain functional complexity and subjective experience have a history that should be properly acknowledged (Barttfeld et al., 2015; Basar and Guntekin, 2009; Seth et al., 2011; Tononi and Edelman, 1998; Tononi et al., 1994). Perhaps the most influential theory on the brain basis of consciousness, is the so-called ‘integrated-information theory’ of consciousness (Tononi et al., 2016), and this includes as one part of it, a measure of brain entropy/complexity. Indeed, it has been said in a critique of the original entropic brain paper that entropy/complexity measures applied to brain function merely ‘depurate’ the integration term from the integrated-information theory (Papo, 2016). This charge is readily accepted but the position is taken here that the entropy/complexity component of the integrated-information theory provides the major share of its explanatory power. This position is empirically substantiated, since it is arguably the complexity/entropy more than the integration measures per se that are so impressively predicting conscious level (Casali et al., 2013; Casarotto et al., 2016; Schartner et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2001). While the requirement for integration is not disregarded (e.g. see the discussion on entropy and criticality in the previous paragraph) and may indeed by critical for access consciousness particularly – it is felt that the key properties of such integration, necessary for consciousness, have not yet been clearly delineated - although see the Global Workspace theory (Baars, 1993) for an appealing model on the importance of integration to conscious experience, as well as more recent work on large-scale (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016a) and long-range connectivity (Kotchoubey et al., 2013). It also remains possible that a role for integration may be implied within entropy/complexity measures; for example, future work may discover the point or zone within which entropy exceeds a critical threshold at which no one coherent, large-scale spatiotemporal configuration can dominate the brain for a sufficiently long-enough for access consciousness to be possible All models are incomplete and the entropic brain is no exception - but it was conceived and intended to offer a simple and useful heuristic, enabling relatively seamless translations to be made between a quantitative measure of the richness of brain activity and the richness of subjective experience.","In summary, four years on from the publication of the original entropic brain hypothesis, the present paper has sought to reflect on its influence, reliability and future scientific and clinical value. The position is maintained that entropy represents a uniquely powerful bridging tool for human neuroscience that will enable a better understanding of the mind-brain relationship and mechanics of consciousness, including how we may treat its abnormalities."
28,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.12.040,"Psychedelics have a long history of use and yet they attract emotive and often polarised opinions in modern Western society. History suggests they may have a place in the treatment of refractory neurotic disorders, particularly depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, addictions and in the psychological challenges associated with death and dying. Psychedelics appear to have a context-dependent effect. This mandates carefully designed trials within safe and comfortable settings staffed with psychotherapists and psychiatrists familiar with their use Whilst modern pilot studies (largely using psilocybin) have shown promise, treatments with classical psychedelics will need to stand up to the scrutiny of the RCT design, which itself poses significant challenges. The money to finance RCTs with psychedelics will likely come from a mixture of profit-driven commercial enterprises, charitable organisations, crowd-funding and government. The aim of RCTs is to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If safety and efficacy is confirmed, licensing and rescheduling will likely follow. At this point, psychedelics will need to demonstrate deliverability and cost-effectiveness if they are to become established and accepted treatments. Many treatments fail these tests. Delivery of psychedelics in real-world healthcare is likely to be expensive relative to other interventions, underlining our opinion that they are best investigated as options for those with socioeconomically costly psychiatric problems (such as treatment resistant depression) that are refractory to cheaper and more established therapies.",
29,10.1007/s13311-017-0542-y,"The current state of modern research suggests considerable therapeutic promise for psilocybin. This research is most advanced regarding the treatment of cancer-related psychiatric distress, with three randomized, placebo-controlled trials showing promising results for psilocybin [38,39,40]. Two of these trials involved a moderate number of participants and administered relatively large doses of psilocybin [39, 40]. These two studies, in particular, provide strong evidence showing substantial decreases in depressive and anxious symptoms that appear to persist for at least 6 months after a single active treatment. Such results are unprecedented in psychiatry. The single open-label study of treatment-resistant depression outside the context of cancer provides initial preliminary evidence that persisting antidepressant effects of psilocybin might not be limited to those with cancer [42]. If future trials with larger numbers of participants continue to show such persisting therapeutic effects and a favorable adverse effect profile, psilocybin may garner regulatory approval for use as a medicine in the USA and other nations. If approval is obtained, regulations governing clinical use should closely mirror the screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up procedures used in research studies to maximize efficacy and minimize medical and behavioral risks Psilocybin in the treatment of addiction is currently at an earlier stage of research, with two recent open-label, pilot studies, one for tobacco smoking cessation and one treating alcohol dependence, suggesting potential safety and efficacy. Both of these lines of addiction research are being followed up with larger, randomized studies. If these trials continue to show safety and efficacy, a similar medications development pathway as described for cancer-related psychiatric distress could be anticipated. Although clinical approval for either cancer-related psychiatric distress treatment or addiction treatment do not depend on identification of mechanisms of action, it seems very likely that advancing knowledge of both biological and psychological mechanisms underlying efficacy would lead to advances that improve treatment outcomes The US federal funding agencies have yet to support therapeutic psilocybin research. This is understandable given the complex social history surrounding classic psychedelics, and their perceived association with cultural changes that took place in the 1960s and early 1970s. However, as compelling evidence mounts for safety and efficacy, it will be important for government agencies to take a leadership role in supporting cautious and scholarly research on classic psychedelic therapeutics. The recent research with psilocybin, especially evidence of long persisting therapeutic effects that may stem from a single medication administration, suggests that therapy with classic psychedelics may constitute a major new area of medicine that might eventually alleviate suffering across multiple potential disorders.",
30,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2016.03.002,"As described above, acute ayahuasca intake leads to a transient modified state of awareness characterized by introspection, visions, and autobiographic and emotional memories (Riba et al., 2001). Both naïve and regular ayahuasca users have described the experience as positive and valuable, and some individuals have reported health improvements associated with ayahuasca intake (Loizaga-Velder, 2013, Barbosa et al., 2009). Reports of decreased consumption of alcohol, cocaine and other addictive drugs are common in regular ayahuasca users (Fabregas et al., 2010, Thomas et al., 2013). Anecdotal data also suggest an antidepressant effect for ayahuasca (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2014, Schmid, 2014). These testimonies have stimulated research into the potential benefits of ayahuasca in the treatment of substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions The available literature examining the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca can be classified into three main groups. In a first group we find studies on the molecular mechanisms of ayahuasca alkaloids: receptor binding studies and in vitro assays, as well as pharmacological studies in animal models. This group of investigations has examined the mechanisms of action that could explain the psychotropic effects of ayahuasca and the beneficial effects described by users. The second group of studies includes case reports describing beneficial effects in psychiatric symptomatology. Disorders include substance use disorders, anxiety and depression. However, most of these papers provide information from few subjects usually taking ayahuasca in the context of a religious group. This confounding factor has raised doubts as to whether beneficial effects can be attributed exclusively to ayahuasca. The third and more recent group of reports includes case-control studies and open label trials with psychiatric inpatients. These new investigations constitute a step forward in terms of methodological rigor, but designs are still not ideal, as will be discussed below As mentioned in previous sections, ayahuasca is a complex mixture of alkaloids. Thus, the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in its therapeutic effects are numerous Agonism of DMT at the 5-HT2A receptor sites may already have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. This has been shown in animals using the selective agonist DOI (Masuda and Sugiyama, 2000, Nic Dhonnchadha et al., 2003). This possibility is supported by the success of recent therapeutic trials that have used various psychedelics which have the common feature of stimulating this receptor (Grob et al., 2011, Gasser et al., 2015). In addition to increased glutamatergic transmission and rapid electrophysiological changes, agonism at this level has been shown to stimulate BDNF release and neurogenesis (Baumeister et al., 2014). These slower secondary events may also play a role in the beneficial effects of 5-HT2A agonists The recently uncovered modulatory role of DMT at the orphan receptor sigma-1 receptor (S1R) (Fontanilla et al., 2009) could also be involved in the effects of ayahuasca. As discussed above, the SR1 is a chaperone receptor promoting neural plasticity. Long-term exposure to ayahuasca could potentially lead to neural changes mediated through this mechanism The pharmacology of the beta-carbolines can be directly associated with therapeutic effects in depression and anxiety. MAO inhibition is a known therapeutic approach to treat these disorders. All three major beta-carbolines, harmol, harmalol and tetrahydroharmol have MAO-inhibiting properties (Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977a). Additionally, THH is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977b). Inhibition of the serotonin transporter is the main pharmacological mechanism of many of the antidepressants currently used in clinical practice. Increased monoamine concentrations in the synapse following ayahuasca intake could contribute to the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of B. caapi preparations. Harmine is also known to inhibit DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A) in a potent and specific manner (Adayev et al., 2011). This kinase that affects neurite formation and maturation is up-regulated in Down Syndrome as a result of the trisomy (Mazur-Kolecka et al., 2012) Halpern et al. (2008) reported a remission of drug or alcohol abuse/dependence in an ayahuasca community sample (6.5 years average of membership). In another case series study (Thomas et al., 2013), the authors found statistically significant reductions in cocaine use after an ayahuasca-assisted therapy in a sample of members of a First Nations community in Canada with no prior experience with ayahuasca. They also reported improvements in mindfulness, empowerment, hopefulness, quality of life-outlook and quality of life-meaning. Similar effects on substance use were found in two case-control studies (Fabregas et al., 2010, Grob et al., 1996). Grob et al. (1996) reported remission of alcohol, depressive, or anxiety disorders and changes in behavior, attitude toward others and outlook on life in a 15 long-term sample of ayahuasca users, compared to 15 matched controls with no prior history of ayahuasca ingestion. Fabregas et al. (2010) reported an improvement in alcohol use and cessation of drug use (except cannabis) in two groups of jungle and urban-based ayahuasca users compared to non ayahuasca users. These findings were maintained at one-year follow-up. Other descriptive studies, such as observational pilot studies, reports and informal interviews (i. e. Bouso and Riba, 2014; Doering-Silveira et al., 2005; Labate et al., 2014), have presented preliminary evidence, suggesting a potential beneficial role for ayahuasca in the treatment of substance use disorders As regards anxiety and depression, Barbosa et al. (2005) reported reductions in associated symptomatology after a first consumption of ayahuasca in a sample of Santo Daime members. They also reported behavioral changes, such as increased assertivity, vivacity and joy in members of two groups of ayahuasca users: the União do Vegetal and the Santo Daime. A case-control study (dos Santos et al., 2007) used psychometric measures of anxiety, panic-like and hopelessness in regular (10 years) ayahuasca users, members of the Santo Daime. While under the acute effects of ayahuasca, participants scored lower on the scales for panic- and hopelessness-related states, but no modification of state- or trait-anxiety was reported following ayahuasca ingestion More recently, two open-label trials (Osorio et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016) evaluated the effects of a single dose of ayahuasca in psychiatric depressive inpatients. Osorio et al. (2015) observed statistically significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores (HAM-D, MADRS, and the Anxious-Depression subscale of the BPRS) between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after the administration. Furthermore, ayahuasca administration did not trigger episodes of mania or hypomania as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Neither did it lead to increases in the Thinking disorder subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). In a subsequent study by the same group (Sanches et al., 2016), the authors reported significant decreases in scores on the same depression scales (HAM-D, MADRS, BPRS- Anxious-Depression), from 80 min after administration to day 21. No effects were observed on the YMRS and Activation BPRS subscale. Nevertheless, they reported increases in dissociative symptoms as measured by the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). The study included a SPECT assessment that found increased blood perfusion in the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area, a series of brain regions related to the regulation of mood and emotional states.","Ayahuasca has a long history of ceremonial use and its recent worldwide expansion is providing an unprecedented opportunity to study its impact on human health. An increasing number of papers suggest reasonable safety and benefits in mood and psychiatry symptoms in the areas of substance use disorders, anxiety and depression Preliminary findings on the potential psychological mechanisms associated with therapeutic benefits indicate similarities with mindfulness-based therapy. Ayahuasca appears to enhance self-acceptance and decentering, crucial aspects associated with psychotherapeutic treatment outcome in several psychiatric disorders. From a neural perspective, neuroimaging studies after an ayahuasca intake have reported activation in areas associated with emotional processing and memory formation. These results suggest that similarly to exposure therapies, ayahuasca allows reviewing emotional events, but with increased vividness and sense of “reality”. We postulate that the state induced by ayahuasca could be useful in the treatment of trauma, substance use disorders, impulsive-related disorders, and certain patients suffering from borderline personality disorder More research is warranted in clinical populations, using larger samples, matched comparison groups, randomized designs and blinded raters to confirm its efficacy. Finally, it will be necessary for future studies to implement adequate settings and involve clinicians with specific training to ensure the safety of participants."
31,10.7554/eLife.35082,"Interest in the potential clinical effects of psychedelics is boosted by positive preliminary reports on the safety and tolerability in healthy participants as well as patient populations (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Gasser et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). However, the underlying neuropharmacology psychedelics is scarcely investigated in humans. The current study closes major knowledge gaps in the area by characterizing the effects of the prototypical psychedelic by showing that i) LSD increases GBC across sensory and somatomotor functional networks and reduces GBC in associative networks, which is sensitive to GS removal; ii) time-dependent effects are only found in the interaction with katenserin; iii) GBC in the somatomotor network was associated with subjective effects; iv) LSD-induced effects on GBC and subjective symptoms are linked to the pharmacology of the 5-HT2A receptor; v) innovative gene expression analyses across cortex reveal for the first time a correspondence between specific spatial gene expression patterns and in-vivo pharmacological effects in humans We show across conditions that LSD induces hyper-connectivity predominantly in sensory and somatomotor areas (i.e. the occipital cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the postcentral gyrus). LSD-induced hypo-connectivity was observed across subcortical areas (with the exception of the amygdala and sensory thalamus) as well as cortical areas associated with associative networks (i.e. the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulum, the insula, and the temporoparietal junction) (Figure 1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LSD induces a de-synchronization of associative networks whereas sensory and somatomotor areas exhibit elevated brain-wide shared signal (Anticevic et al., 2014b). This is in line with previous seed-based studies reporting increased V1 resting-state connectivity with the rest of the brain after LSD administration (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). Additionally, decreases of connectivity within the DMN were reported after ayahuasca, a tea containing the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, intake (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015). Furthermore, desynchronization within the DMN was reported after psilocybin infusion measured with magnetoencephalography (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013). As noted, while subcortical areas predominantly show hypo-connectivity under LSD there were key exceptions: the amygdala exhibited brain-wide hyper-connectivity under LSD. Amygdala neurons abundantly express 5-HT2A receptors, and alterations in amygdala activity and connectivity have been hypothesized to be important for potential beneficial clinical effects of psychedelics (Rainnie, 1999; Kraehenmann et al., 2016). Furthermore, results showed that participants with the highest LSD-induced coupling within sensory and somatomotor networks also showed the strongest LSD-induced de-coupling in associative networks. This suggests that LSD-induced alterations in information flow across these networks probably results from linked systems-level perturbations, as opposed to being due to dissociable mechanisms across subjects. This pattern of hyper-and hypo-connectivity may underlie the psychedelic state, suggesting increased processing of sensory information which is not counterbalanced by associative network integrity. Consequently, this may result in an altered state of consciousness whereby internal and external sensory computations are not integrated, leading to psychedelic symptoms A virtually identical pattern of hyper-connectivity in sensory networks and hypo-connectivity in associative networks is revealed when contrasting LSD effects with the condition where LSD is blocked by pre-administration of Ket. This brain-wide net effect of LSD was virtually indistinguishable from LSD vs. Pla condition. Put differently, pre-treatment of LSD with Ketanserin induced only negligible changes compared to LSD vs. Pla, indicating that Ket blocked virtually all LSD-induced alterations in GBC. Ketanserin has high antagonistic properties particularly on the 5-HT2A receptor. Thus, these results indicate that LSD-induced alterations in neural and behavioral effects are highly dependent on stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor (Leysen et al., 1982). This is in line with data on subjective LSD-induced effects which were normalized by Ket pretreatment (Figure 1G) Collectively, these data extend previous studies by revealing that the described pattern of brain-wide dysconnectivity may be directly attributable to stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor. Specifically, the effect can be characterized by brain-wide integration of sensory networks and dis-integration of associative networks, which presumably underlie LSD-induced altered state of consciousness. Furthermore, these data highlight the importance of the 5-HT2A receptor system in LSD-induced neural and behavioral alterations One small study by Tagliazucchi et al. has previously investigated the effects of intravenously administered LSD and reports that association cortices (partially overlapping with the default-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) and the thalamus showed increased GBC under LSD (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). These results are partially contradictory to the data presented in Figure 1. Importantly, this previous study did not quantify the influence of the GS, which likely contains a complex mixture of non-neuronal artefacts (e.g. respiration, which may be increased under LSD [Power et al., 2017; Glasser et al., 2017]). Such artefacts can induce spuriously high statistical association across the brain (Yang et al., 2014; Coyle, 2006). Due to these discrepancies, we studied the data as a function of GS regression to inform how this methodological step affects results (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). These analysis support the observations by Tagliazucchi et al. (2016) when GS was not considered: results showed increased GBC in fronto-parietal, temporal, and subcortical areas (Figure 2). The analysis without GSR showed a positive correlation between hyper- and hypo-connectivity change scores, indicating that participants with the highest LSD-induced hyper-connectivity showed the weakest LSD-induced de-coupling. This was in contrast to results after GS removal. Furthermore, connectivity values with GSR and those without GSR were not significantly correlated within subjects (Figure 2). Notably, without GS regression, LSD-Pla differences were not observed when examining seven functionally pre-defined networks (Figure 7). These data suggest that GS related effects cannot be explained by a mean-shift in connectivity values on average, but instead may reflect a process within each subject One hypothesis is that GSR statistically attenuates non-neural arts and therefore provides a method to better isolate functional networks in pharmacological resting-state connectivity studies (Yang et al., 2014; Coyle, 2006). This interpretation is consistent with the absence of a neural-symptom correlation without GSR. Finally, spatial correlations with gene expression maps (discussed below) were notably attenuated for without GSR. That said, this dataset is not well-suited for drawing conclusions about GSR suitability for pharmacological neuroimaging. In fact, it can be argued that results are more replicable across session 1 and 2 without GSR. However, the statistical phenomenon of ‘artefactual’ replication is not surprising, if one considers that GSR is designed to attenuate sources of spatially pervasive structured artefacts which may persist across sessions; f.e. elevated respiratory artefacts). Put differently, there is a key nuance between ‘noise’ and ‘artefact’. Pure unstructured noise can be signal-averaged out and would not yield a consistent ‘artefactual’ effect. In contrast, ‘structured’ artefact represents a signal that can induce the same spurious effect multiple times (Power et al., 2018; Glasser et al., 2018). Therefore, if a structured artefact is large across both measurements (session 1 and 2), then this artefact will spuriously drive the effect and will be replicable. Experiments that manipulate variables such as breathing rate and vigilance will be key to fully characterize the effects of GSR on pharmacological neuroimaging data and help separate neuropharmacological effects associated with ‘global artefacts’ versus those affecting ‘global neural signal’ (Glasser et al., 2018). Furthermore, there are open knowledge gaps regarding LSD’s effects on neurovascular coupling and the hemodynamic response function properties. This pitfall needs to be addressed in experiments incorporating measures specifically designed to investigate changes in hemodynamic coupling. Here animal studies, which offer the possibility to combine neuronal recordings with simultaneous measurement of hemodynamics, will be critical to help interpret LSD effects inhumans As expected, the GS analyses indicate that a GBC metric is highly sensitive to global shared signal, which is altered under LSD. This raises the question regarding the direction of the LSD-induced effects on association vs. sensory-somatomotor areas. To inform the directionality of LSD modulations of GBC we completed an additional analyses based on seed-based thalamic functional connectivity, which yielded a map that was robust to GS transformations. The reason for this phenomenon is that the thalamus exhibits strong bi-directional brain-wide shared signal. Furthermore, we constructed a conjunction measure that identified baseline (i.e. Pla) thalamic FC that was interpretationally consistent irrespective of GS-related shifts (Figure 4). This seed-based conjunction analysis revealed that LSD-induced changes were consistent after GSR and comparable to GBC effects. Without GS removal, neither the thalamic nor GBC effects converged across metrics. This observation, however, does not rule out the possibility that GS removal in fact attenuates signal components that are neuronal in origin and may be relevant to important LSD-induced properties (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Careful manipulation and measurement of respiratory-related artefacts during pharmacological fMRI is needed to disambiguate the amount of GS variance that relates to neuronal vs. artefactual LSD effects Animal studies suggest distinct temporal phases of LSD pharmacology (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007). Therefore, we investigated the time-dependent effects of LSD on subjective effects as well as on GBC. As shown in Figure 5, subjective effects were highest 180 min after LSD administration and decreased in intensity 250 and 360 min after administration as expected (Passie et al., 2008; Schmid et al., 2015). No differences were found between Pla and Ket+LSD conditions at any time point, with subjective effects in both conditions being very low in intensity (<4.7%). This shows that Ket blocked subjective LSD-induced effects over the whole time course, indicating that subjective effects are most likely attributable to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. To investigate the time course of LSD-induced effects on GBC, two resting-state scans were analyzed, conducted 75 min (session 1) and 300 min (session 2) after the second drug administration. While no significant differences were observed when comparing session 1 and 2 within the Pla and the LSD condition (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), participants showed significant changes in GBC in session two compared to session one in the Ket+LSD condition. Taken together with time-dependent results observed in the functionally defined networks (Figure 6), the blocking effect of ketanersin is particularly evident in the session one across all networks. Specifically, Ket not only blocks LSD effects in session one but also augments the effects seen in Pla, indicating the opposite mechanism of action from that seen by LSD – namely 5-HT2A receptor antagonism (Leysen et al., 1982; Kometer et al., 2013). On the other hand, it seems possible that there exist two distinct pharmacological time phases as described in animal studies. The first phase may be modulated by 5-HT2A receptor activation and the second phase possibly by D2 receptor activation, as suggested by preclinical work (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007). This hypothesis of time-dependent complex receptor pharmacology awaits further testing. First, studies are needed to investigate the effect of Ket alone on GBC to verify the preferential effects of 5-HT2A antagonism. Second, studies using pre-treatment of LSD by antagonists on receptors other than 5-HT2A are needed to determine if the second phase is indeed modulated by another receptor system. Lastly, indications of different pharmacological phases are not evident from subjective drug effects which remain completely blocked by Ket. Studies using higher doses of LSD are therefore needed to investigate if the potential effect of LSD’s action on other receptors becomes more pronounced and therefore subjectively accessible The LSD-induced change in connectivity in the somatomotor network correlated significantly with general and specific subjective LSD-induced effects (mean across all scales, blissful state, disembodiment, changed meaning of percepts, elementary imagery, spiritual experience). Participants with increased connectivity in the somatomotor network also showed higher subjective effects. On average, the change in connectivity between the LSD and Pla condition in the somatomotor network was not significant. However, this is likely explained by the heterogeneous connectivity changes within this network: while the pre- and postcentral gyrus predominantly showed increases in GBC, medial areas were hypo-connected. Connectivity changes in other functional networks were not significantly correlated with subjective effects. This points to the importance somatomotor network brain regions and their connectivity with the rest of the brain for psychedelic experiences. This is in line with previous results obtained from task-related data showing that the supplementary motor area is associated with LSD-induced alterations in meaning and personal relevance processing (Preller et al., 2017). These results also support broader theories of consciousness emphasizing the importance of the sensorimotor system for the perception of presence and agency, and therefore a sense of self (e.g., interoceptive predictive coding model of conscious presence (Seth et al., 2011), comparator model (Frith et al., 2000; Allen et al., 2016; Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Furthermore, alterations in sensorimotor gating have been suggested to underlie psychedelic experiences (Quednow et al., 2012; Ludewig et al., 2003). Somatomotor system activity and connectivity has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Anticevic et al., 2014a), an illness characterized by delusions and alterations in the sense of self, potentially arising from alterations in sensorimotor gating deficits in an inferential mechanism that allows distinguishing whether or not a sensory event has been self-produced (Synofzik et al., 2010). The current results corroborate and extend these previous findings by showing that somatomotor network connectivity is also closely associated with an LSD-induced psychedelic state To further investigate LSD’s receptor pharmacology we specifically used the threshold-free Z-score map of LSD effects relative to Ket blockade and Pla. The logic here is that such a map may reflect Ket-specific contributions to LSD blockade, which is hypothesized to involve the 5-HT2A receptor. This map was then correlated with gene expression maps of receptors that may be stimulated by LSD (Nichols, 2004). LSD-induced changes in functional connectivity after GSR exhibited strong positive relationships with HTR2A expression (higher than 95.9% of all possible gene expression correlations, Figure 9). These results show that LSD-induced changes in GBC quantitatively match the spatial expression profile of genes coding for the 5-HT2A receptor, supporting the central role of this receptor system in LSD’s neuronal and subjective effects. LSD-induced changes in functional connectivity were also highly negatively correlated with HTR7 gene expression (lower than 99.8% of all possible gene expression correlations, Figure 9). This can be explained by the highly anti-correlated expression of these two genes (Figure 9). However, it is also possible that the 5-HT7 receptor functionally contributes to LSD-induced effects. In contrast to its agonistic properties on the 5-HT2A receptor, LSD has been reported to be an antagonist in the 5-HT7 receptor (Wacker et al., 2013). Since previous studies have shown that 5-HT7 receptor antagonists have anti-psychotic potential (Waters et al., 2012; Abbas et al., 2009), it seems very unlikely that LSD’s effects have a strong and appreciable contribution on the 5-HT7 receptor. However, future studies should examine 5-HT7 receptor pharmacology more carefully as they may reveal a role of this receptor system in pro-cognitive effects that contrast those of LSD. While the current results strongly implicate the involvement of the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD-induced effects, it must be noted that no further conclusions can be drawn regarding the functional contribution of other receptors agonized or antagonized by LSD. This limitation needs further investigation in future studies by blocking serotonin and dopamine receptors involved in the pharmacology of LSD beyond the 5-HT2A receptor. Furthermore, the contribution of these receptors to the effects of different doses of LSD still need to be studied. Finally, we show that the spatial match between gene expression maps and GBC maps is significantly improved after GSR, even though correlation coefficients in particular for DRD1, DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2C remain moderate. These results also highlight the validity of this approach as a general method for relating spatial gene expression profiles to neuropharmacological manipulations in humans. An important next step allowing further methodological validation is comparing LSD-induced alterations in GBC with receptor maps provided by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Saulin et al., 2012; Ettrup et al., 2016; Ettrup et al., 2014), preferably using MR scanners that are both MR and PET compliant allowing for cross-validation across BOLD and PET modalities within the same person","In summary, the current results close major knowledge-gaps regarding the neurobiology and neuropharmacology of LSD. First, we show that LSD induces widespread alterations of GBC in cortical and subcortical brain areas, characterized by a synchronization of sensory and somatomotor functional networks and dis-integration of associative networks. We show that this effect is sensitive to GSR, which has important implications for future pharmacological resting-state studies. Second, we investigated the receptor-pharmacology of LSD, showing that the 5-HT2A receptor plays a critical role in subjective and neuronal LSD-induced effects. However, analyzing the time course of LSD-induced alterations in functional connectivity, it seems likely that at a later phase, modulation by receptors other than the 5-HT2A receptor is involved. The comparison of LSD-induced effects on functional connectivity and receptor-gene expression maps underscores the interpretations of 5-HT2A pharmacology and points to potentially impactful studies on 5-HT7 receptor pharmacology. Lastly, in line with various theories of consciousness we showed that the somatomotor system in particular is related to LSD-induced psychedelic effects. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of psychedelic compounds and offer important directions for development of novel therapeutics."
32,10.1007/s00213-016-4377-8,"The aim of the present study was to further investigate the psychological mechanisms underlying the ayahuasca experience, and specifically whether ayahuasca acutely affects creative thinking. It was shown that during the acute inebriation, ayahuasca caused a decrease in conventional convergent thinking and enhanced creative divergent thinking, as measured by the PCT. All dependent variables associated with the PLMT remained unaffected The ayahuasca-induced enhancement of divergent thinking could potentially be linked to the effects ayahuasca exerts on brain regions involved in creativity. Three core networks, i.e., the default mode network (DMN), including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortices, the central executive network (CEN), including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortices, and the salience network (SN), including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, interact during divergent thinking via corticostriatal-thalamocortical loops (Chávez-Eakle et al. 2007; de Manzano et al. 2010; Fink et al. 2009; Geyer and Vollenweider 2008; Jung et al. 2013; Pinho et al. 2015). The thalamus feeds information into the SN which in turn coordinates the other mentioned networks (Beaty et al. 2016; Uddin 2015). The SN monitors events occurring outside of the body as well as internal consciousness and is able to direct attention to whatever is more important at a certain moment in time. It is suggested that especially these shifts between these externally (CEN) and internally (DMN) oriented cognitive networks are very important in creative divergent thinking (Jung et al. 2013; Perlovsky and Levine 2012). Interestingly, previous research has shown that ayahuasca reduced thalamic gating of sensory and cognitive information (Riba et al. 2002). Taking into account the neuronal pathways previously described, this could lead to an increase in information fed into the salience network. Consistent with this line of thinking is the fact that Riba and colleagues (2006) showed an increase in blood perfusion in the SN after ayahuasca ingestion. Previously, other imaging studies with psychedelics also showed increased blood perfusion or a higher metabolic rate of glucose in the frontal and paralimbic areas during (e.g., anterior insula, anterior cingulate) psilocybin and mescaline (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 1999a, b; Hermle et al. 1992; Riba et al. 2006; Vollenweider et al. 1997). In addition, Alonso et al. (2015) found broad-band power decrements in the EEG signal after ayahuasca compared to placebo. Based on the knowledge about negative correlations between EEG and BOLD (Moosmann et al. 2003), this was interpreted as reflecting increased activation of areas involved in visual processing and in the cognitive-emotional processing anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area that is central to the SN Alonso et al. (2015) also showed a temporary induced disruption of neural hierarchies by ayahuasca, i.e., by reducing top-down control and increasing bottom-up information transfer in the human brain (Alonso et al. 2015). It was suggested that the higher excitability of posterior regions in combination with the loosening of the cognitive grip exerted by frontal regions responsible for executive control may underlie the associations and insights that emerge during the experience (Alonso et al. 2015). Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) also found other parts of these networks to be influenced by ayahuasca, i.e., they showed a decrement in the functional connectivity in parts of the DMN after ayahuasca ingestion (Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015). It was suggested that this could result in more cognitive flexibility and consequently potentially enhanced divergent thinking (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014). However, Petri et al. (2014) suggest that the picture is more complex as they showed that the brain does not become a random system after psilocybin administration but still has stable connections which are different from the placebo state and only present in the psychedelic state (Petri et al. 2014). Likewise, Roseman et al. (2014) showed an increase in between-network resting state functional connectivity under psilocybin across normally distinct brain networks (Roseman et al. 2014). This increased integration between cortical areas could give rise to more associations (Petri et al. 2014) and an increased influence of imagination on visual perception (Roseman et al. 2014). Still, the precise neurobiological underpinning of how psychedelics may enhance divergent creative thinking remains largely unknown, and further research is warranted Convergent thinking can be seen as the second phase in the creative thinking process, i.e., focused on narrowing possibilities to a workable solution after the ideas have been generated through divergent thinking (Hennessey and Amabile 2009). Studies have shown this phase to be associated with an increase in CEN activity (Sowden et al. 2015). In the present study, ayahuasca caused deterioration in convergent thinking. Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) found that ayahuasca only influenced activity in the DMN without changing the connection between DMN and CEN (Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015). The absence of ayahuasca enhancing effects on the CEN, together with the decrease in thalamic gating and loosened cognitive control described by Alonso and colleagues (2015), could explain the negative effect of ayahuasca on convergent thinking (Alonso et al. 2015). However, research with other psychedelics, e.g., psilocybin, showed an increase in functional connectivity between the DMN and the task-positive network or CEN (Carhart-Harris et al. 2013; Roseman et al. 2014) Ayahuasca selectively affected performance in the PCT and not in the PLMT. Anecdotal reports from participants suggest that the stimuli of the PCT elicited more novel thoughts due to their more complex and colorful nature. In contrast, the stimuli in the PLMT contrast were very simple black-and-white line drawings. The latter probably gave less input into the system involved in the generation of new ideas. Another point to be mentioned is the quasi-experimental design of this study which potentially limits the conclusions that can be drawn from it. It could be argued that because ayahuasca sessions always followed the baseline session, and as it is known that ideas can get more creative over time (Beaty and Silvia 2012), a potential order effect could have influenced the results. However, besides the fact that parallel versions of tasks were used in a randomized order to counter potential order effects, the double dissociation, i.e., improvement of divergent thinking and impairment of convergent thinking, suggests that results were not subjected to the serial order effect Previously, it has been shown that the connection between divergent thinking and mood is particularly strong and positive (Baas et al. 2008; Davis 2009), i.e., more positive mood improves divergent thinking. In contrast, convergent thinking and mood are related in a negative way: more positive mood lowers convergent thinking. Mood of participants in the present study was generally very positive, which may have contributed to their openness to creative ideas. Mood ratings were only taken after drinking ayahuasca and could not be compared to mood states before drinking; nonetheless, they differed statistically from 0. In the future, placebo-controlled studies including measures of mood could test whether mood changes are a moderator in the effects of ayahuasca. Another point which could be addressed in future research is the usefulness of ideas generated in the divergent thinking task as this is part of the definition of divergent creative thinking. By including for example a task in which this quality can be assessed, e.g., the “alternate uses task,” it can be tested whether ayahuasca also improves this aspect of divergent thinking It would be interesting and important in the light of potential clinical applications of ayahuasca to investigate whether the effects are stable or also vary in time. It is known that ayahuasca induces an intense modified state of consciousness, starting between 35 and 40 min after administration and lasting approximately 4 h (Frecska et al. 2016). We showed that during this period, divergent thinking was enhanced and convergent thinking distorted. Soler et al. (2015) demonstrated that 24 h after ayahuasca intake, mindfulness-related capacities were enhanced (Soler et al. 2015). Mindfulness, a state of nonjudgmental, sustained, and alert awareness which improves people’s cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal functioning, has been shown to be linked with convergent thinking and less with divergent thinking (Lebuda et al. 2016). Based on these findings, it could be interesting to see whether convergent thinking is recovered 24 h after ayahuasca administration. It is suggested, based on a study of Bouso et al. (2008) on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in post-traumatic stress disorder, that the potential effect pattern of ayahuasca would make it suited for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. The increase in divergent thinking during the acute phase could help patients relive events, recalling various associations without feeling inhibited (Bouso et al. 2008; Frecska et al. 2012, 2016). The sub-acute effects could then be suited in a second, “integration” session in which patients discuss the experiences they had on ayahuasca and find strategies that help them cope with intensive emotions. Future studies should therefore not only focus on either the acute or sub-acute phase but also take both stages into account In the past decade, a renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics has emerged (Anderson 2012; McKenna 2004; Sessa and Johnson 2015). The present study has shown that ayahuasca promotes divergent thinking, an ability which has been shown to be an important aspect in cognitive therapy (Forgeard and Elstein 2014). It can therefore be suggested that ayahuasca possesses qualities that can promote a therapeutic process. However, since convergent thinking is also a critical aspect in therapy, and the current findings show that ayahuasca impairs this facet during the acute phase, future studies have to investigate whether this effect profile changes over time. Additional research utilizing a placebo-controlled experimental design, including additional creativity measures, is warranted, before results can be generalized.

33,10.1177/0022167817706884,"Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is a promising combination intervention for the treatment of psychological distress, psychiatric conditions, and “the betterment of well people” (Bob Jesse, cited in Pollan, 2015). Despite the resurgence in research using psilocybin in recent years, the psychological mechanisms of action involved in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are not yet well understood. Current theory regarding psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic mechanisms of action posits that the occasion of a mystical experience is the primary mediating factor leading to positive treatment outcomes. While the construct of a “complete mystical experience,” for example, as defined by exceeding a cutoff score on the Pahnke–Richards Mystical Experience Questionnaire (Griffiths et al., 2006) has been shown to be one mediator of positive outcomes in randomized controlled trials (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2008; MacLean et al., 2011), the findings of this study suggest a more complex topography. It is conceivable that a single mediating factor is insufficient to account for multilevel phenomena that carry cognitive, emotional, behavioral, psychodynamic, spiritual, existential, and/or experiential components of significance The current study appears to be the first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The findings of this study suggest that there are important relational, bodily, affective, and other aspects of participant experiences that may play critical roles. First, participants universally described deeply meaningful attachments to important family members and significant others. Relationships were woven throughout participant narratives, with themes of forgiveness of others, loved ones as spirit guides, the importance of narrating one’s experience with loved ones, and improved relationships posttreatment. In this way, the psilocybin experience may be conceived as relationally embedded. In many ways, this is unsurprising, given the important contributions of attachment theory (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 2014; Bowlby, 1980, 2005), relational theory (Mitchell, 1988; Wachtel, 2010), and interpersonal theory (Sullivan, 2013) to human development, which have yet to be thoroughly integrated into psychedelic research paradigms. Nearly all participants reported having an experience of love and joy, though these exalted experiences arose primarily through a specific human relationship with another person, whether it was a parent, child, or partner. As Anais Nin (1971) once wrote, “The personal, if it is deep enough, becomes universal, mythical, symbolic” (p. 153). These findings indicate that a relational theoretical framework may have utility in assessing the importance of transformed interpersonal and intrapsychic configurations occasioned by psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Second, the findings of the current study also suggest that embodiment, and especially alterations or transfigurations of normally felt embodied states, is a critical feature of participant experiences. Although participants did describe discarnate phenomena, some of the most compelling accounts spoke of bodily ejections of cancer and visions of accepting their bodies. Participants described enhanced interoceptive awareness, somatic synesthetic experiences, and alterations to their sense of self as embodied beings. Despite a trend toward embodiment as a broad interpretative framework in the social and behavioral sciences (Csordas, 1994; Gibbs, 2005; Niedenthal, Barsalou, Winkielman, Krauth-Gruber, & Ric, 2005), subjectively experienced body states are not currently being assessed in clinical trials with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Third, slightly more than half of participants recounted acute reactions of fear, confusion, panic, or paranoia during the psilocybin dosage session. These were transient processes, and no serious adverse events attributable to the study treatment occurred during the course of this trial. The findings presented here suggest that transient periods of distress, even intense experiences of fear and panic, can be well tolerated by study participants in a supportive therapeutic milieu. The development of a trusting therapeutic alliance between the participant and the study therapists before the psilocybin administration session, followed by adequate integration psychotherapy sessions afterward, provides a crucial supportive context. While a straightforward review may deem experiences of transient psychological distress as undesirable side effects, both participants and the research team came to understand these difficult experiences as part of a necessary and ultimately beneficial process. In the midst of fear and dysphoria, participants described how they came to surrender or “let go,” leading from a defensive posture of emotional or psychological resistance to an accepting posture characterized by feelings of relief, wholeness, freedom, and affirmation. Through a collaborative interpretative process, our research team generated a variety of ways of labeling these transient phenomena, including the following: the shadow, the difficult struggle, the dark night of the soul, wrathful guardians of the gates of the mandala, ego death, heaven and hell, and existential collapse. Each offered certain advantages but also brought with them unwanted baggage from the psychological, theological, and psychedelic traditions from which they were borrowed. Such periods of transient distress may serve as a necessary “turning point” in an unfolding process, as feelings of fear, panic, and anxiety transmute into feelings of love, joy, and forgiveness Fourth, these findings indicate that psilocybin occasions a rich and complex range of human emotions. Participants described powerful and healing catharses suggesting an emotional trajectory. Participant affects have either not been assessed formally in clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, or the range of assessment is limited, as with the use of visual analogue scales assessing feelings of fear, paranoia, and joy (Turton et al., 2014). Our findings suggest that participants may emerge from this treatment having experienced profound emotional depths and expanded affective boundaries. Future research may evaluate cathartic release and the depth and breadth of affect states occasioned during psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Fifth, participant accounts reveal a colorful, even fantastical range of complex closed-eye visual phenomena. These visions are ideographically instantiated within subjective processes. These complex visualizations are not merely interesting scenes painted on the proscenium curtain of the theater of the mind. Rather, among study participants, these visions served as principle organizing motifs of subjective experience with multifold vectors (e.g., audiovisual, relational, autobiographical, spiritual, epistemological, ontological). Such visions were often deeply coded with layers of meaning by participants Sixth, study participants described lasting impacts to their quality of life, life priorities, and their sense of identity. During their psilocybin experiences, many participants “remembered” aspects of themselves that had been forgotten. They recovered a sense of what is most important and vital in their lives, such as being present in the moment or being kind to other people. Participants described feeling “reborn,” more expansive, more confident, more connected, and more alive. They described a feeling of empowerment and being “unstuck,” with resulting healthier behaviors. As two participants reported significant weight loss, future research regarding the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy as an intervention for obesity and eating disorders may be warranted A number of limitations to this study should be noted. The interview guide focused primarily on the participant experiences during the psilocybin dosage session rather than the preparatory and integration psychotherapy sessions, which we see as essential components. The timing of the interview poses certain concerns, as approximately half the sample were interviewed within 1 week following their second psilocybin dosage session, which allowed little time to review lasting impacts of their experiences but afforded at least one integration psychotherapy session to help consolidate memory and meaning. Conversely, as eight participants were interviewed at approximately 1-year follow-up, the clarity of their recall regarding specific phenomenal experiences a year earlier may have been subject to distortion or clouding. Additionally, the current analysis does not formally address participant–therapist interactions or the nature of therapeutic action as experienced by the patients nor does it address the variety of experiences related to cancer, death, and spirituality reported by this cohort of cancer patients, which is documented in a subsequent article (Swift et al., 2017) This is perhaps the first qualitative study to explore the subjective inner texture of participant experiences of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The findings of the study support the conclusion that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is well accepted by participants and constitutes a promising intervention for the treatment of existential and psychological distress provoked by a cancer diagnosis. An IPA revealed a complex, multilevel set of processes. Participants experience this treatment as relationally embedded, physically embodied, affect laden, deeply meaningful, and biographically instantiated, with lasting impacts to their experience of themselves and the world. Future research is warranted to attend to these and other possible mediating factors in the design of clinical trials to better articulate psychological mechanisms of action and maximize therapeutic benefit.",
34,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.05.012,"All 8 factors and other lines of evidence taken together indicate the profile of a substance that is characterized by some level of abuse potential and potential risks. However, the findings do not support placement more restrictively than Schedule IV. The current placement in Schedule I is presently necessitated by the absence of FDA approval for a psilocybin containing medicine and Schedule I is the only Schedule into which substances of abuse can be placed that do not have an approved medical indication. However, it is the opinion of the authors of this review that the original placement of psilocybin was the result of a substantial overestimation of the risk of harm and abuse potential. The CSA stipulates that Schedule I is for substances with a high potential for abuse, lack of therapeutic approval, and that cannot be used safely in medicine. History of use and available scientific data show that the first criterion is questionable, and the third criterion is likely not true. The second of these criteria can only be negated by FDA approval of a psilocybin-containing products, but at this point the data suggest that the potential therapeutic benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy are real, and of potential medical and public health significance Schedule placement is guided by an analysis of the 8 factors of the CSA that will be drafted by the FDA with input from NIDA. The 8-factor analysis contained in this review should be considered an abbreviated assessment of abuse potential as compared to what would be required by the FDA to accompany the submission of an NDA for approval of a psilocybin containing drug product. Furthermore, considerable additional study will yet be required to support the submission of a complete and reviewable NDA and its abuse potential assessment. This will include at least one major phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety trial that includes assessments relevant to abuse potential, additional Phase 1 and/or 2 clinical studies, and possibly some animal testing (Calderon et al., 2017; Sellers et al., 2017). Thus data yet to be collected will influence the final scheduling proposal that will be made by the sponsor and, in turn by the FDA, NIDA, and DEA. Nonetheless, considerable data from animal self-administration and discrimination studies, and human abuse potential studies since the 1960s provide a substantial basis for the present preliminary evaluation. In contrast to Schedule III drugs and even to many drugs placed in Schedule IV, the reinforcing effects in preclinical studies are marginal. There is no clear evidence of physical dependence and withdrawal in preclinical or clinical studies, or among those who chronically used illicit products. Euphoriant effects can occur under limited circumstances but appear attenuated by dysphoric effects. The doses that pose a risk of acute poisoning death (“overdose”) appear to be approximately 1000 times the likely highest clinical dose to be marketed, psychological dependence resulting in daily use appears rare, and all major drug surveillance systems reviewed in Factors 4, 5, and 6 of this analysis indicate rates of abuse, emergency department reports, and treatment seeking in youth and adults that are substantially lower than are evident for many Schedule IV drugs. It is possible, of course that subsequent study with larger populations and different designs in animals and humans, would yield different outcomes, but this review suggests that psilocybin would be appropriately placed in Schedule IV of the CSA if the FDA approves a psilocybin NDA The authors of this review recognize that opinions in the general population may differ substantially as it is clear that there remains a legacy of fear regarding psychedelics since the 1960s. The role of the 8-factor analysis of the CSA is to bring science to bear to support the foundation for scheduling, implications for other aspects of scheduling which are based on much of the same data. In particular, this means the labeling that will be specific to the label section, Drug Abuse and Dependence (section 9 of the drug labeling), and warnings including the possible requirement of a Boxed Warning (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2017d). As with all approved drug products, determination of safe and effective by the FDA does not mean without risk, and the conclusion that the science does not support scheduling more restrictive than IV does not mean no abuse or dependence risk This analysis has implications for future research with psilocybin and for the possible development of related drugs. Perhaps most challenging and important is research to better understand the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and related drugs that can produce profound and very long lasting positive changes in mood and well-being in people who were resistant to standard care and approved medicines. Given the extent to which undertreated and treatment resistant mental and behavioral disorders, including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, remain serious problems at the personal and societal levels in the US and globally (Belouin and Henningfield, 2018), it could be concluded that the need for such research is urgent The dearth of therapeutic and mechanistic studies of psilocybin and other classic psychedelics over the past half-century does not stem from a lack of interest among psychologists, psychiatrists, pharmacologists and neuroscientists. Research has been and continues to be limited by the provisions of the CSA and the lack of prioritization of such research by potential federal funding agencies. As discussed elsewhere, the barriers to research imposed by Schedule I regulation are formidable and although they do not outright ban such research, the consequence has been that this area of science and potential clinical application has been greatly under-researched (Belouin and Henningfield, 2018; Nutt, 2015; Nutt et al., 2013; Scientific American Editors, 2014; Sinha, 2001; Spillane, 2004; Woodworth, 2011). Several of the key clinical studies have been primarily supported by private foundations rather than federal institutions such as NIH (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2016) The science of drug abuse potential assessment has evolved considerably in recent decades and this is evident in the FDA's 2017 guidance document, “Assessment of Abuse Potential of Drugs,” that summarizes research strategies, and methods and discusses how these can be brought to bear to provide the regulatory science foundation for drug scheduling decisions. The application of this scientific approach to further evaluate the abuse potential of psilocybin provides an example of how this area of regulatory science has the potential to facilitate innovative therapeutic breakthroughs by replacing fear and misinformation with scientifically based conclusions and facts",
35,10.1016/j.tips.2017.08.003,"In summary, we hypothesize that the induction of synapse-related gene expression in key neuronal populations identified by molecular studies and the robust alterations observed in neural circuits by imaging studies are highly interrelated processes (Figure 2). The ability of psychedelic drugs, such as LSD and psilocybin, to cause disruption of established neural connectivity and the emergence of novel functional associations may underlie the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics in a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses [41]. The results of psychedelic research using animal models, such as the induction of specific synapse-associated genes, puts the human neuroimaging findings of markedly altered functional connectivity into a new context. Therefore, biomedical research into psychedelics should take on a more translational nature (Figure 3), in which reverse translation (or bedside to bench) plays a prominent role. Questions remain as to the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the response to psychedelic drugs. For example, why do different brain regions have different transcriptional responses in what appear to be the same cell type? What roles do interneurons and glia play in hallucinogenic behaviors? Investigators can therefore prioritize brain regions that are altered by psychedelic exposure in fMRI studies, such as the visual cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, to further elucidate what molecular and cellular mechanisms may underlie the broad network changes seen in those regions Clearly, many questions remain regarding the biology of these compounds and their use in the clinic (see Outstanding Questions). Drug development in psychiatry has lagged dramatically behind other biomedical disciplines 72, 73, and many of the most commonly used psychiatric medications were discovered serendipitously and often also possess complex adverse effects. Therefore, given the promising results seen in early phase clinical trials with psychedelic drugs for the treatment of addiction, anxiety, and depression, the research community must validate the efficacy of these drugs in more rigorous trials to achieve a better understanding of their mechanisms in the body",
36,10.1038/s41598-017-05407-9,"Here we showed that adult neural stem cell activity is regulated by harmine, THH, and harmaline, the most abundant alkaloids in B. caapi and ayahuasca, and by harmol, the main metabolite of harmine in humans31. Using an in vitro model of adult neurogenesis, we found that all four β-carbolines stimulated the proliferation and migration of progenitor cells and promoted their differentiation predominantly into neurons The four compounds tested effectively promoted proliferation, migration, and differentiation of progenitor cells obtained from the SVZ and the SGZ, the two main niches of adult neurogenesis in rodents. The β-carbolines increased the number and size of primary neurospheres, induced the loss of the neurospheres’ undifferentiated state, and promoted subsequent cell migration and differentiation mainly into a neuronal phenotype, as indicated by the positive expression of β-III-tubulin and MAP2, but also into astroglial cells. Taken together, these three effects indicate that B. caapi alkaloids have the capacity to regulate the expansion and fate of stem cell populations Analysis of the proliferation stage showed that all four β-carbolines increased the number and size of neurospheres, the number of Ki-67-stained cells, and the amounts of Ki-67 and PCNA protein as measured by Western blot. Our results for the effect of harmine on proliferation are in line with a previous study showing harmine-induced increase in mitosis in cultured chick embryo cells32, and in human neural progenitor cells33. To our knowledge, the effects of harmaline and THH on neurogenesis have not been studied before. While harmaline is only present in small amounts in B. caapi, THH is the second most abundant β-carboline in the plant4, 29. Additionally, THH shows more consistent plasma levels between individuals and studies than harmine, which is rapidly degraded to harmol when taken orally29, 34. The latter, formed in vivo by O-demethylation of the parent compound29, showed proliferative effects of similar magnitude to those of harmine Our results showed that B. caapi β-carbolines promoted cellular migration and differentiation, suggesting that these alkaloids not only act as mitogens for neural stem cells, but also modulate cellular fate. The largest effects on migration were observed for harmaline and THH. Increased migration capacity is relevant in certain conditions such as brain injury, where stem cell niches are far from the damaged area35,36,37. All tested compounds also promoted cellular differentiation. Neural stem cells are known to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes23, 24. The observed increases in Tuj-1 and MAP-2 protein expression indicated differentiation predominantly toward a neuronal phenotype. In the SVZ both proteins were equally expressed after each of the four treatments. However, in the SGZ harmine administration did not influence Tuj-1 levels, a marker of immature neurons, but significantly increased the expression of MAP-2, suggesting a larger impact on neuronal maturation All the above indicate that B. caapi β-carbolines facilitate neurogenesis at multiple levels. This capacity is of interest, since in pathological conditions the replacement of neurons may be optimized by acting simultaneously on various processes38, 39. The effect of the β-carbolines on cellular proliferation and differentiation is not unique to these compounds, having been observed for endogenous molecules such as leukotriene B440, BMPs41, the growth factors EGF/FGF242, and NGF/BDNF/bFGF43, and the transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b44. However, the fact that the β-carbolines also stimulated migration highlights the versatility of these exogenous compounds, as they can promote the three processes involved in full adult neurogenesis A likely possible explanation for the observed effects of β-carbolines in neurogenesis is the increase in monoamine levels caused by MAO inhibition. With this said, we must acknowledge that the magnitude of the neurogenic effects was similar for the four compounds, despite harmol and THH being inhibitors that are between a hundred and a thousand times weaker than harmine or harmaline5. Moreover, the role of monoamines in neurogenesis is not fully understood. Knocking out the 5-HT1A receptor in mice impaired neurogenesis after fluoxetine but not after imipramine, indicating that neurogenesis was independent from elevated serotonin levels45. In another study, the authors reported the unexpected finding that serotonin depletion actually promoted hippocampal neurogenesis instead of decreasing it46. In a recent paper, harmine, but not the MAO inhibitor pargyline, stimulated proliferation of human neural progenitor cells in vitro 33. Harmine effects were mediated through inhibition of the DYRK1A kinase rather than through MAO inhibition. This opens the possibility that the β-carbolines tested here regulated stem cell fate via DYRK1A or other alternative mechanisms. To our knowledge, the inhibitory effects of harmaline, tetrahydroharmine and harmol on DYRK1A has not been examined. Other potential molecular targets for the neurogenic effects of small molecules include the modulation of the GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway 47, upregulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor48, increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor49; and glucocorticoid receptor activation50. Future studies should assess whether B. caapi β-carbolines interact with one or more of these pathway Our findings have relevant therapeutic implications. The association between neurogenesis and anti-depressant activity is well documented45, 51. Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis reduces depression-like behaviors in animals51. Furthermore, clinically effective antidepressants stimulate neurogenesis, independent of their chemical structure and mechanism of action. To cite a few examples, chronic treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine increases neurogenesis in rats52, 53, as does chronic treatment with the selective MAO-A inhibitor pirlindole53. The association between neurogenesis and antidepressant effect is not limited to rodents and pharmacological interventions. Electroconvulsive therapy in primates also stimulates proliferation of neural precursors in the hippocampus and their differentiation into neurons54. Hippocampal neurogenesis appears to be necessary for antidepressant action. Irradiation of the SGZ of the hippocampus in mice prevents the neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine and imipramine In humans, two recent clinical studies have demonstrated rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects after a single ayahuasca dose in patients who did not respond to conventional treatment11, 12. The therapeutic potential of ayahuasca is an area of increasing research interest beyond depression55. Alterations in adult neurogenic niches have been associated with a number of pathologies affecting the central nervous system56,57,58,59. Stimulation of these niches is currently being investigated as a novel therapeutic strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders60,61,62. Regular ayahuasca use has been associated decreases in problematic alcohol, cocaine and opiate consumption, indicating anti-addiction properties for B. caapi preparations63, 64. These potential anti-addictive properties are particularly relevant if we acknowledge the notorious difficulty of treating substance use disorders. Drug-dependent patients not only show functional deficits in reward processing and cognitive control, but also structural alterations in brain gray and white matter Our study has a series of limitations that need to be acknowledged. Ayahuasca brews contain other active compounds that were not tested here. A popular version of ayahuasca in the USA and Europe contains DMT, a serotonergic psychedelic9. It is possible that DMT may have contributed to the antidepressant effects reported in clinical studies using ayahuasca11, 12. This contribution could be due to both brain plasticity mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation66 and to the profound psychological experiences induced by psychedelics67. While studying DMT in the neurogenesis model was not an objective of the present investigation, it could be assessed in a future study, comparing it with other 5-HT2A agonists such as psilocybin or LSD. Although several animal studies have already shown that harmine improves behavioral measures of depression17, 18, future studies could ideally test the four compounds assessed here for both in vivo neurogenesis and behavioral improvement. Finally, future research could also use positive controls to compare the potency of the B. caapi β-carbolines with that of other antidepressants, such as SSRIs and MAO inhibitors In conclusion, here we showed that the β-carboline alkaloids present in B. caapi, the plant source of the ayahuasca tea, promote neurogenesis in vitro by stimulating neural progenitor pool expansion, and by inducing cellular migration and differentiation into a neuronal phenotype. The stimulation of neurogenic niches in the adult brain may substantially contribute to the antidepressant effects reported for ayahuasca in recent clinical studies. The versatility and full neurogenic capacity of the B. caapi β-carbolines warrant further investigation of these compounds. Their ability to modulate brain plasticity indicates their therapeutic potential for a broad range of psychiatric and neurologic disorders",
37,10.1038/s41386-019-0324-9,"We here show that psilocybin ingestion of between 3 and 30 mg is associated with dose-dependent occupancy of cerebral 5-HT2ARs. Further, plasma psilocin concentration and 5-HT2AR occupancy are positively associated and the relationship conforms with a single-site binding model. Lastly, subjective intensity ratings are positively correlated with both neocortical 5-HT2AR occupancy and plasma psilocin levels, strongly supporting that stimulation of cerebral 5-HT2ARs is paramount for the psychedelic effects of psilocybin Similar to previous 5-HT2AR PET-imaging occupancy studies with other 5-HT2AR drugs [31, 32], we found that the single-site binding model provided a good fit of the relation between drug blood levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy, and predicted maximum occupancies were similar. Here, it is important to emphasize that the occupancies detected with an agonist radioligand (such as [11C]Cimbi-36) may differ from that of antagonist radioligands because an agonist radioligand may bind preferentially to receptors in the high-affinity state [33, 34]. Thus, given that high-affinity receptors are believed to be most important for neurotransmission, an agonist radioligand may yield a more relevant estimate of receptor levels We found the EC50 of psilocin to be 1.95 μg/L. This corresponds to 10 nM, which is in the same range of Ki values from in vitro studies (rat cortex) performed with another 5-HT2AR agonist, [125I]DOI: 6 nM [35] or 25 nM [36] The post hoc linear regressions showed positive associations between mean PET 1 intensity ratings and MEQ30, global 11-D ASC score, and EDI score, and intensity ratings correlated also with both occupancy and with psilocin levels (Fig. 4). Thus, although the participants scored their overall intensity of the psychedelic experience based on a number of different components (e.g., imagery, changes in perception, stimulation of mood, feeling of enhanced meaning, somatic sensations, etc.), and probably also as a function of previous drug experience and psychological make-up (“set”), including personal coping style, our results show that intensity ratings constitute a meaningful global measure of psychedelic experience that is feasible to obtain with high temporal resolution Previous studies in humans reported that antagonists at 5-HT2A and 2C receptors can prevent perceptual effects after subsequent ingestion of psilocybin [9, 10]. Our data show that psilocin plasma levels correlate with occupancy (Fig. 3), that psilocin levels and occupancy correlate with intensity (Fig. 4), and that intensity correlates with scores of MEQ30, 11D-ASC and EDI. Thus, our findings strongly support that 5-HT2AR stimulation is central for psychedelic experiences in humans, and adding our findings to the existing literature, the evidence is by now strong that the 5-HT2AR is indeed the critical molecular mediator of psychedelic effects of psilocybin Our model can in future studies assist to estimate psilocin brain 5-HT2AR receptor occupancy without the use of PET-imaging, by determining plasma psilocin levels. For example, Brown and colleagues recently reported that ingestion of 25 mg psilocybin results in a mean Cmax of about 15 ng/mL [37]. Assuming analysis methods of similar quality, similar stability of psilocin samples and a plasma density of 1.02 g/mL [38], this plasma psilocin level corresponds to 69% occupancy. There is considerable inter-individual variability in psilocybin pharmacokinetics [37, 39, 40]. Consistent with this, Cmax for Subject 3 (12 mg, 0.14 mg/kg) was higher than Cmax values for Subjects 4, 5, and 6 (15, 18, and 24 mg, respectively; 0.2, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg). Importantly, our data convincingly demonstrate that plasma psilocin levels correlate closely with the overall psychedelic experience, and it is possible that future clinical trials may benefit from relating psilocin levels and/or estimated occupancies to clinical effects, rather than absolute doses Recently, it has been argued that psychedelic “microdosing”, entailing a dose small enough to avoid noticeable perceptual effects [41], comes with benefits such as enhanced creativity, social interaction and mood. Although a dose range of 0.5–2 mg psilocybin has been suggested as a psilocybin microdose (Dr. James Fadiman, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, personal communication), there are currently no data available to identify such a cut-off. Subject 1 received 3 mg (0.05 mg/kg), had noticeable perceptual effects and an occupancy of 43%. This indicates that a smaller dose/lower occupancy would be needed for microdosing studies. Based on our data, a dose range of 0.5–2 mg is a reasonable suggestion for potential psilocybin microdose studies A few limitations of the study should be noted. When fitted to a single-site binding model without constraining Occmax = 100%, we found Occmax = 77%. Possible explanations for this include violations of kinetic modeling assumptions [13, 42], rapid internalization of 5-HT2AR or psilocybin-associated lowering of brain 5-HT levels. Although weaker than for 5-HT2AR, psilocin has also affinity to 5-HT 2B, 5-HT 2C, and 5-HT 1A receptors [36, 43]; the affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) is about 100 times lower [43]. A net decrease in cerebral 5-HT levels due to psilocin agonist activity at 5-HT1A autoreceptors could lead to an underestimation of occupancy due to decreased competition at 5-HT2ARs during intervention scans [44]. In vitro studies reported that 5-HT2AR stimulation led to 5-HT2AR internalization [45,46,47,48]. We cannot exclude that [11C]- Cimbi-36, being an agonist radioligand, has different affinity to internalized 5-HT2AR, leading to an underestimation of occupancy. We did not observe a difference between EC50 values of PET 1 and 2, suggesting that if internalization occurred, it occurred either very rapidly (within a few minutes) or very slowly (days after). For Subject 1 who received only 3 mg, occupancy was 43% at PET 1 and 2% at PET 2, speaking against 5-HT2AR internalization. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to investigate long-term effects of a single psilocybin dose on cerebral 5-HT2AR levels, as a potential molecular mediator of the long-term effects on personality and mood [3,4,5, 49]. Such a study is currently ongoing in our lab We did not observe statistically significant median head motion during PET 1 or PET 2 compared to baseline scans (Supplementary Methods and Materials). Participants 7 and 8 exhibited maximum motion of up to 35 and 20 mm during PET 1, respectively. Although this could affect the kinetic modeling, model fits were acceptable and comparable to baseline scans. Our conclusions are based on only eight participants, but five were investigated three times which generated two occupancy measures for each of these participants. The majority of male participants, that participants were recruited as specifically interested in a neuroimaging study investigating psilocybin, and the narrow age range decreases generalizability of our findings to the extent there are sex-dependent or age-dependent differences in psilocybin [50] or radioligand kinetics and differences in psilocin levels, occupancy or intensity ratings as a function of propensity to seek study participation in a psychedelics research study. PET-environment was positively correlated with anxiety during a psilocybin intervention [51] and we cannot exclude that the PET-environment influenced the psychedelic experience [29], making experiences less comparable to therapeutic or naturalistic settings. Yet, our participants experienced anxiety only to a very limited extent (11-D ASC anxiety subscale (median [range]: 4.25 [0; 17.3]). The study was not placebo-controlled and it is possible that this may have ultimately affected intensity ratings. Also, we cannot rule out that metabolites of psilocin or expectation-induced changes in 5-HT levels could affect the occupancy estimates, although we are unaware of evidence suggesting this In summary, we find that in humans, psychedelic effects of psilocybin are closely correlated with psilocin stimulation of the 5-HT2AR, and our data allows for an objective assessment of psilocybin effects on 5-HT2AR in future studies, by measuring plasma psilocin levels",
38,10.1590/1516-4446-2015-1701,"In this systematic review, we identified 21 studies on the anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids that met our inclusion criteria. Despite the small number of studies and the high degree of heterogeneity among them, the reported results consistently show that these compounds have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties. These findings will be discussed in detail below Research performed among ayahuasca consumers over the last 20 years shows that users of this substance do not exhibit symptoms of psychiatric disorders or neurocognitive problems, but instead show normal or better cognitive function, increased well-being and spirituality, and reduced psychopathology, including anxiety and depression symptoms.10-12,14,15,34-36 Moreover, DMT administration to healthy volunteers suggest that this tryptamine may have anxiolytic properties Studies in rodents have reported that the β-carbolines harmine and harmaline, as well as ayahuasca, produce anxiolytic or antidepressive effects. As harmaline acts as a MAO-A inhibitor,3,5 the anxiolytic effects of this compound22,23 could be theoretically explained by an enhancement of serotonin concentrations in the brain after MAO-A inhibition.37 Nevertheless, the mechanisms of action responsible for the anxiolytic and antidepressive properties of harmine and harmaline are not completely understood, and other non-serotonergic mechanisms could also be involved Specifically, the antidepressive effects of harmine are apparently independent of its effects as a MAO-A inhibitor,3,5 and seem to be mediated by regulation of cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress,28-30 and modulation of BDNF, an endogenous protein involved in neuroplasticity and depressive symptoms.25-27 Harmine and harmaline also bind to 5-HT2A receptors.38-40 Since hallucinogens increase cortical glutamate levels following activation of 5-HT2A receptors, increasing the expression of BDNF in prefrontal areas,41 42-43 the agonist action of harmine and harmaline in this serotonergic receptor could also lead to increased BDNF levels A study suggested that the GABAA receptor could be involved in the antidepressive effects of harmine.24 Nevertheless, some studies suggest that harmine, harmaline, and THH display little affinity for benzodiazepine receptors Regarding DMT, there is evidence that 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists modulate emotional processing, reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increase positive mood. Interestingly, cortical expression of 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor is altered in post-mortem samples of depressed patients.43 Therapeutic drugs that are 5-HT1A receptor agonists produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects in animals and humans,37,43,44 and 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects in animals.45 46-47 Moreover, there is increasing evidence that anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with inflammatory processes, and 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists have anti-inflammatory properties Other 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also produce reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and increases in positive mood. In the mid-1950s and 1960s, several studies investigated the potential therapeutic use of psilocybin and LSD in the treatment of disorders such as neurosis and OCDs, and as an adjunctive therapy in the terminally ill.42,51 52 53 54 55-56 However, a definite conclusion regarding the potential beneficial effects of these compounds cannot be drawn from previous investigations, since many of these studies had important methodological limitations, such as lack of a control group or randomization, absence of double-blind/placebo-controlled designs, and limited follow-up data Recent studies reported that psilocybin produces anxiolytic effects in mice in the marble burying test, an animal model of OCD,57 and that LSD produced antidepressive-like effects and normalized learning behavior and hippocampal serotonin 5-HT2 signaling in a rat model of depression (olfactory bulbectomy) As previously reported, smoked DMT increased positive mood in healthy voluntters,6 and both psilocybin59 60 61 62-63 and LSD64 also increased positive mood in experimental studies in humans. Case reports56,65 66 67-68 and clinical trials69 suggest that psilocybin and LSD may be beneficial for patients with OCD. Moreover, psilocybin- and LSD-assisted psychotherapy has been shown to reduce anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in patients with anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases such as advanced-stage cancer The antidepressive properties of ayahuasca could also be related to alterations of cortical connectivity in the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain areas involved in introspection, meditative states, daydreaming, imagination, and mind-wandering. Depressive states are associated with increased rumination, a self-referential process that may become difficult to disengage and is associated with increased activity of the DMN, and acute ayahuasca administration (2.2 mL/kg of body weight) significantly reduced DMN activation.73 A recent study evaluated cortical thickness in 22 regular users of ayahuasca (average 5.3 years of continuous use; range: 2-13 years) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reported significant cortical thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key node of the DMN Regarding other serotonergic hallucinogens, a recent functional MRI (fMRI) study involving intravenous administration of psilocybin (2 mg) to 15 healthy volunteers reported significant decreased cerebral blood flow in several brain areas including the PCC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), another important component of the DMN.75 A subsequent study reported increased functional connectivity of the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN), involved in goal-directed attentional tasks.76 Since the DMN and TPN have opposite functions, the authors suggested that the subjective effects of hallucinogens, as well as psychotic and meditative states, could be caused by disruption of DMN-TPN functional connectivity. This disruption would obfuscate the separateness of internally and externally focused states, profoundly altering cognition, perceptions, emotions, and consciousness. However, no significant change was observed in DMN-TPN connectivity after acute ayahuasca administration. Thus, further studies are needed to better explore the subjective and therapeutic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens Animal and human studies suggest that ayahuasca and its alkaloids can produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects, which are probably mediated by agonist action on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors. These receptors are involved in emotional processing, regulation of BDNF brain levels, anti-inflammatory actions, and altered DMN functional connectivity. However, the mechanisms of action involved in these therapeutic effects are not completely understood, and, at least in the case of harmine, may include non-serotonergic mechanisms that regulate cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxidative stress Considering that the average time necessary for the onset of therapeutic action of commercially available antidepressants is 2 weeks,77 the fast antidepressant action of ayahuasca reported in our preliminary clinical trial is promising. Recently, our group increased the number of depressive patients receiving ayahuasca treatment and used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess regional cerebral blood flow after drug administration. Our results suggest similar positive effects as described in our pilot study In summary, the results of this systematic review suggest that ayahuasca and its alkaloids have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties. These results are supported by studies using rodent models of anxiety and depressive disorders, experimental studies in healthy volunteers, observational studies in ayahuasca consumers, and preliminary data from depressed patients Investigation of these compounds could provide new pharmacological treatments with fast-acting beneficial effects for patients with anxiety and depressive disorders. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings Limitations of the present review include the small number of studies, especially clinical trials, and the heterogeneity among reviewed reports. Furthermore, most evidence showing anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or its alkaloids comes from rodent studies. Thus, it is premature to extrapolate these results to humans until more research is conducted With the exception of a single pilot study, the human studies included in this review were mostly experimental and observational in nature. The experimental studies described had small sample sizes and were not designed to assess anxiolytic or antidepressive effect. An important limitation of observational studies with long-term ayahuasca consumers is that it is generally very hard to differentiate whether the improvements described are a consequence of the ingestion of ayahuasca or of joining a religious group, which can improve quality of life and well-being.79 Experimental and observational studies provide weak evidence of causality, and until more clinical trials are developed, the available evidence in humans must be considered preliminary Despite these limitations, the results showing anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids are relatively constant, and have been reported in rodents, healthy volunteers, and depressed patients",
39,10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.024,"In this paper, we determined the agonist-activated structure of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor coupled to its canonical transducer Gαq, compared it with inactive state structures stabilized by both the partial agonist LSD and the inverse agonist methiothepin, and identified key determinants essential for agonist actions and receptor-Gq coupling. Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of classical psychedelics including LSD, psilocin, mescaline, and various N-BOH analogs, these studies provide structural insights into the actions of psychedelics at their molecular target. Importantly, we also discovered that the specific interactions the 5-HT2A receptor achieves with Gq residues are essential for the apparently selective engagement of this receptor with Gq-family proteins in vitro Some of these findings contrast with predictions from a recent study utilizing chimeric Gα subunits that indicated that HTR2A interact efficiently with all of the 11 tested Gα subunits, albeit with low efficacy at Gαs (Inoue et al., 2019). However, the Gα subtypes in that study (Inoue et al., 2019) were created by replacing the terminal seven amino acids of Gq with the corresponding sequences from several other Gα subunits using the motif LXXXLX (where X = subtype selective sequences) (Inoue et al., 2019). Pertinent to this, we note that immediately prior to L353 is Q352 that is conserved among all of the chimeric G proteins employed in the study by Inoue et al. (2019). Here, we discovered that the Q352 cognate residue directly interacts with HTR2A TM6 residue N3176.29, and mutation of this residue abolishes the ability of HTR2A to activate Gq. We also point out that in the only other Gq-GPCR structure available, the same Q352 interacts directly with the TM5 residue R5.46 (Maeda et al., 2019). Importantly, using assays in which full-length heterotrimeric G proteins were used, we find that HTR2A productively couples weakly with only one Gi-family member, Gαz Relevant to these findings, we also found important interactions outside the α5 helix that are essential for HTR2A-Gq interactions. Thus, R132ICL2 interacts via an extended backbone interaction with N32 of the α-helical domain, and we further demonstrated via mutagenesis and functional assays that this interaction is essential for agonist-induced activation of Gq. This GPCR-Gq interaction is not seen in the M1-G11 structure, although R134ICL2 in M1 could weakly interact with the backbone carbonyl of R32 in Gq based on an examination of that prior structure. These results underscore suggestions made decades ago that the selectivity determinants for Gα subunits may not be entirely specified by reside in their terminal 5–7 amino acids (Wess, 1997) We also discovered that a key hydrophobic residue essential for G protein coupling among various GPCRs—I181ICL2—when mutated, abolishes Gαq coupling while potentiating arrestin binding at HTR2A. This result was unexpected because there was no prior data with sufficiently high resolution of GPCR-arrestin complexes that could illuminate how the mutation of a single amino acid at the GPCR-Gα interface would switch the coupling of HTR2A from an unbiased to an arrestin-exclusive state. While this paper was in revision, however, a 3.3 Å resolution structure of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor complexed with human β-arrestin1 was reported (Lee et al., 2020). A comparison of this structure with the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (Rasmussen et al., 2011) and our HTR2A-Gq structure reveals that the cognate hydrophobic residue F139ICL2 in β2-AR interacts with the Gs α5-helix in a manner similar to HTR2A-Gq. In the β1 adrenergic receptor-Arrestin structure, by contrast, F147ICL2 is displaced upward where it would potentially clash with residues in the α5 helix of Gs (Figure 7I) and where it is engaged in no productive interactions. A similar relative lack of extensive engagement of this cognate residue with arrestins can be seen in the lower resolution muscarinic- and neurotensin-receptor arrestin complexes (Huang et al., 2020; Staus et al., 2020) (Figure 7J) This analysis provides a potential structural explanation for how loss of this hydrophobic interaction impairs Gq subunit coupling while preserving arrestin interaction—at least for HTR2A In addition to these fundamental insights into GPCR-Gq interactions, our findings have relevance for neuropsychiatric drug discovery. Psilocybin and LSD have emerged as potential therapeutics for a number of neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and cluster headaches (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Bogenschutz, 2013; Gasser et al., 2015; Sewell et al., 2006; Nutt et al., 2020). Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of psilocybin in humans (Kometer et al., 2013; Nutt et al., 2020), insights into the molecular details of both HTR2A ligand recognition and HTR2A-effector coupling are key to arriving at a molecular understanding of hallucinogen actions. Additionally, these studies will provide a framework for a structure-guided search to identify more selective and efficacious HTR2A agonists as potential innovative neuropsychiatric therapeutics as recently exemplified by us for other GPCRs (Lyu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017; Stein et al., 2020)",
40,10.1371/journal.pone.0211023,"This was exploratory research that investigated people’s experience of and attitudes toward microdosing. Study One showed that, in the short term, microdosing led to an immediate boost across a range of psychological variables but that these effects were (mostly) not sustained over multiple days. Longer term, we found evidence that microdosing led to improved mental health, altered attentional capacities (reduced mind wandering and increased absorption), and increased neuroticism Study Two showed that amongst people who are interested in microdosing there are strongly held beliefs that microdosing can impact a wide range of psychological variables. A substantial majority of media reports on microdosing present the practice in glowing and positive terms. This may have led to a perception of microdosing as a general panacea that is able to improve virtually all aspects of an individual’s life. It is not clear the degree to which these expectations influence individuals’ interpretation and reports of their microdosing experiences Taken together these findings paint an intriguing picture. We found clear changes in a small set of psychological variables: decreased depression and stress; decreased mind wandering; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. Notably, these variables were not those that participants most expected to change. If the current findings were entirely due to expectation, then we should have seen changes in those variables that are most commonly discussed in media and online accounts of microdosing, and in those variables rated highest in Study Two. In fact several of the most commonly discussed effects of microdosing and the effects most expected to change (creativity, wellbeing, mindfulness) showed no evidence of alteration whatsoever. This suggests that the longer term changes we identified were unlikely to be due to expectation On the other hand, although we did identify clear short term changes following each microdose in the daily analyses, the longer term changes identified in Study One were unrelated to the total number of doses participants ingested during the study period and also unrelated to participants’ prior microdosing experiences. This surprising lack of a relationship between the overall quantity of microdoses and the degree of subjective effects is a reason to interpret these findings cautiously. At face value this suggests that any engagement with microdosing, whether a single dose or relatively frequent dosing, can impact the variables we identified. This may be the case, but it is also possible that participants’ self reports of dosage and frequency in this study were not precise enough to accurately characterise dose related effects Overall, these findings suggest several disconnects between the popular narrative around microdosing and the experience of microdosers in this sample. Participants in Study One microdosed less often than is recommended in most online protocols and did not report that many of the immediate effects of microdosing lasted beyond the day of dosing. Although popular accounts of microdosing describe sustained boosts in productivity and creativity [16–18], the longer term effects we identified mainly involved reduced mental distress and changes in constructs such as absorption and mind wandering that are not as commonly discussed. This suggests that microdosing may lead to more subtle changes characterised by improvements in mental stability, the capacity to sustain attention and increased ability to become engaged in intense imaginative experiences The most surprising finding was that neuroticism also appeared to increase following microdosing. This is not something that is discussed in popular accounts of microdosing and was not what participants expected in Study Two. This highlights an important and under discussed aspect of microdosing: not everyone has a positive experience. Although the majority of participants’ comments were positive (and even glowing), there were a subset of comments that reflected unease about microdosing (see Table 5). In a context of considerable hype around the practice of microdosing, particularly with regards to it’s potential as a business tool, it important to acknowledge that microdosing may not be universally beneficial. These findings highlight the need for further research into the full range of microdosing effects (positive and negative) and also for investigations into subtypes of individuals who may particularly benefit from or be adverse to the practice.",
41,10.1111/acps.12904,"In this open-label study of psilocybin therapy for treat-resistant major depression, clinical improvement among patients was found to be accompanied by significant changes in personality measures. Thus, from baseline to 3-month follow-up, the NEO-PI-R ‘Big Five’ score of Neuroticism significantly decreased, Extraversion and Openness scores significantly increased, Conscientiousness showed a trend-level increase, and no changes were seen in Agreeableness. A total of 11 of the 30 NEO_PI-R facets also significantly changed, with 10 of these surviving multiple comparisons correction. To our knowledge, this is the first time personality measures have been reported to change among patients undergoing psychedelic therapy for depression. These results expand on the findings of psilocybin-induced changes of personality traits in healthy volunteers 40 Overall, the detected pre- to post-treatment changes in both trait and facet scores in our trial corresponded well with observations from a study of patients who successfully underwent pharmacotherapy, mostly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for major depression 42. More specifically, the same four of ‘the Big Five’ traits changed in the two trials and in the same direction – that is toward the personality profile of healthy populations (although Conscientiousness only at trend-level in our study). Also several of the facet changes we saw here overlapped with those reported by Costa et al. 42. More specifically, patients in both trials displayed decreases on the Neuroticism facets of depression, vulnerability, self-consciousness, and anxiety. Increases in Extraversion included the facets of warmth and positive emotions. Increases in Conscientiousness included the facets of competence and self-discipline. Means and standard deviations of NEO-PI-R scores were not reported by Costa et al., hindering calculation of effect sizes for direct comparison with our findings (listed in Table 1) Pre- to post-treatment changes in Neuroticism, a known vulnerability marker for affective disorders 44, 45, and increases in Extraversion, a trait associated with general positive affect 46, have previously been found to be significantly correlated with SSRI/SNRI-induced reduction in depression severity 47. In accord with this, QIDS decreases in our study were associated with decreases in Neuroticism and increases in Extraversion, albeit at only trend-level significance. In contrast, increased Openness did not correlate with treatment response and neither was it different between responders and non-responders. This is consistent with the principle that Openness to Experience is orthogonal to anxiety or depression symptoms 46 – although there are also some findings to suggest there is a moderate relationship between Openness and psychological wellbeing 48, 49. Support for the change in Openness score potentially being an addition to, rather than a direct effect of, improved affective symptoms can be taken from a recent naturalistic survey among more than 200 individuals for whom symptomatology and personality measures were assessed online, of a psychedelic experience conducted by our team. Here, Openness changed equally for depressed and non-depressed, whereas changes in Neuroticism were only observed among depressed individuals (manuscript in prep, data not shown) In addition, an extensive meta-analysis of personality changes after therapeutic interventions revealed that trait Openness was the only one among the ‘Big Five’ traits that did not robustly change 50. For a more direct comparison of our NEO-PI-R domain changes to previous treatment studies in depression, we identified 5 patient samples from 3 different trials in major depression where NEO-PI-R changes were reported after treatment with antidepressant medication 47, 51, 52 – although, in one of these studies, only Neuroticism scores were reported 51. Across these trials, SSRIs (citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluoxetine) 47, 51, 52, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (bupropion) 51, 52, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (venlafaxine) 52, a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (moclobemide) 51, a non-selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (phenelzine) 52, and a norepinephrine reuptake blocker (desipramine) 47 were used in relevant clinical doses over 8–20 weeks to treat a total number of 469 patients suffering major depression. The pre- and post-treatment NEO-PI-R domain score data presented in these publications allowed for calculation of Cohen's d effect sizes Interestingly, changes in Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness scores were very similar to what was seen in our study (sample size-weighted average Cohen's d; −0.59, 0.04, and 0.18 respectively, vs. −0.57, −0.01, and 0.27 in our study). In contrast, Cohen's d effect sizes for Openness in our trial were more than 3 times larger (0.44 vs. an average of 0.13) and more than 2 times larger for Extraversion (0.72 vs. 0.32) than the average effect sizes from the comparison trials. Of note, the lack of full consistency regarding follow-up (ranging from 8 to 20 weeks) means that interpretations of direct Cohen's d comparisons across studies should be made cautiously From the present data, it is hard to infer that the NEO-PI-R changes, and in particular changes in Neuroticism and Extraversion, represent trait and not state changes. However, a 3-month enduring change might suggest that it might not just be a state artifact – a notion also supported by the long-lasting psilocybin-induced increases in Openness observed in healthy individuals Whereas the facet scores were not reported in these studies, none of the Openness facets were found to be significantly changed after successful antidepressant treatment in the study by Costa et al. 42. In contrast, the facets Openness to actions and to values significantly increased in our study. The facet Openness to Actions pertains to not being set in one's way, and instead, being ready to try and do new things. Openness to Values is about valuing permissiveness, open-mindedness, and tolerance. These two facets therefore reflect an active approach on the part of the individual to try new ways of doing things and consider other peoples’ values and/or worldviews. Thus, treatment-induced modification of Openness and its facets following psilocybin treatment might be an outcome separate and additional to the changes that have previously been seen with antidepressant treatment for example 50. Whether the pattern of change in personality measures, in particular with regard to Openness, is different between psychedelic therapy and conventional pharmacotherapy (e.g., with SSRIs) should be tested in the future. In our laboratory, we are currently setting up a treatment study in major depression where the effects of such treatment models can be compared directly Studies investigating the relationship between psychedelics and personality among non-depressed individuals are worth considering in this regard. Follow-up evaluations of work from the 1950–60s have suggested the possibility of long-lasting effects on personality, resulting from the use of psychedelics 53, 54, and this has since been confirmed in a series of modern, controlled studies. For example, a single high dose of psilocybin with psychological support was found to facilitate long-lasting increases in trait Openness in psychedelic-naïve healthy individuals 40. Similarly, administration of LSD in a brain imaging setting led to discrete increases in Openness scores in healthy volunteers assessed at 2 weeks after the LSD session 41 although this was not replicated in a recent LSD study with longer postsession follow-up time points (1 month and 12 months) 55. Recently, administration of the entactogen, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), in conjunction with psychotherapy has been shown to lead to increases in Openness, as well as decreases in Neuroticism, in patients being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder 56. Regular ceremonial use of the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca, was associated with higher Openness scores when compared with matched non-ayahuasca using controls 57 and self-reported lifetime recreational psychedelic use correlated positively with Openness scores in a large online survey 58, as well as in a separate brain imaging trial (D. Erritzoe, under review). Interestingly, in the latter trial, it was the Openness to Actions and Openness to Values subfactors that correlated with lifetime psychedelic use (D. Erritzoe, under review) It is well established that trait Openness correlates reliably with liberal political perspective 61-63, 58. Given that psychedelics have been found to modulate Openness and other work has shown that Openness and liberal political perspectives are related, it is reasonable to surmise that psychedelics may modulate political perspective also. Indeed, work in the past has found associations between psychedelic use and attitudes of ‘personal liberty’ and ‘foreign policy liberalism’ 53, as well as concern for others, irrespective of culture of origin 62. Moreover, a series of recent studies have further endorsed a general relationship between psychedelic use and greater pro-environmental behavior 63 and nature-relatedness 58, 63, 64, as well as liberal 60 and antiauthoritarian perspectives 58, 64. The apparent link between Openness and a generally liberal worldview may be attributed to the notion that people who are more open to new experiences are also less personally constrained by convention and that this freedom of attitude extends into every aspect of a person's life, including their political orientation It is worth noting that the Openness score among patients entering our trial was already slightly higher at baseline (2.7 T-score points higher, illustrated in Fig. 1) than the normative scores reported in the NEO-PI-R manual 66 and increased another 4.9 T-score points following the intervention. Openness therefore differed from the other three personality traits in that it changed from an already higher than average baseline to an even higher level 3 months later. In contrast, the other traits all changed in the direction of normative data (see Fig. 1), for example, Neuroticism decreased from an abnormally high level at baseline, whereas Conscientiousness (trend-level) and Extraversion both increased from an abnormally low baseline, and thus toward the values of healthy non-depressed individuals 66. The explanation for Openness being relatively high at baseline may be found in the nature of the trial; people who are less Open to Experience are probably less likely to volunteer for a novel treatment involving a psychedelic drug. In support of this interpretation, healthy volunteers who took part in an invasive PET brain imaging study specifically had significantly higher Openness scores when compared to Danish NEO-PI-R norm data 67 The observation that a single profound psychedelic experience can lead to lasting changes in personality is intriguing, especially when considering the relative stability of personality once adulthood is reached. Longitudinal studies have shown that personality changes after age 30 are typically subtle and/or gradual, that is around 1–2 T-score points per decade, with a subtle drop in Openness and Extraversion scores and a slight increase Agreeableness in older age 68. However, as longitudinal studies of personality are typically conducted with very long intervals between sampling of personality traits, the personality literature overall provides limited evidence for how fast or slow personality trait change can occur 50. Thus, our observation of relatively marked changes in personality within a short time span challenges the assumption that personality can only change slowly, gradually, and subtly. A systematic review of more than 200 studies concluded that enduring and large changes in personality are obtainable through a range of therapeutic interventions 50 but to our knowledge, none so rapidly or as marked as with psychedelics. The phenomenon of psychological ‘quantum change’ may be relevant in this regard 69, where one's outlook and behavior rapidly and profoundly changes – such as with sudden religious conversion experiences Of the acute experience factors that most related to personality change, greater insightfulness during the 25 mg experience was found to be correlated with decreased Neuroticism as well as increased Extraversion at 3 months. Also, greater spiritual experience was correlated with increased Extraversion. Borderline relationships were seen between increased Extraversion and higher blissful state and Experience of unity scores. The observation that the long-lasting impact of psychedelic therapy – in this case on measures of Extraversion and Neuroticism – may depend on their ability to occasion profound insights and ‘peak’ 29 or mystical-type 70 experiences is supported by a number of modern clinical trials, where the magnitude of such peak or mystical experience is often predictive of positive clinical outcome 16, 18, 20, 35, 37. Problems related to the potentially non-secular meaning of ‘mystical experience’ have recently been raised 24 but if the construct has predictive value, then it at least forces us to ask ‘why’? With the exception of spiritual Experience, blissful state, and unity predicting increased Extroversion, the major personality changes observed here were not strongly predicted by factors relevant to ‘mystical experience’. It is interesting that the somewhat more concrete notion of insightfulness showed more compelling relationships with the personality changes in the present study. Importantly, correlation analyses in this paper were not corrected for multiple comparisons and should therefore be considered exploratory in nature. In addition, it should here be noted that the sample size of the present study is modest, in particular when dividing it further into subgroups of responders and non-responders. This limits our statistical power to detect small effect sizes that may be of clinical importance, and future randomized and placebo-controlled trials with larger sample sizes will be important to further substantiate the findings from the present study These present findings are somewhat inconsistent with those of MacLean et al. who found that individuals who had a ‘mystical-type’ experience were more likely to show sustained increases in Openness several months later 40. This may be explained by differences in the study populations, differences in the questionnaires that were used to assess subjective psilocybin experience, attitudes, and philosophy of support provided by the research staff (e.g., relative emphasis on mystical experience during preparation), or by the time delay at which personality was assessed (i.e., 3 months in the present study and over 12 in the MacLean study) The neurobiological correlates of personality change after psychedelics have yet to be investigated. However, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has revealed that brain serotonin 2A receptor levels, the key initiator of psychedelics’ signature psychological and neurophysiological effects 71 are positively associated with Neuroticism scores 67. In fact, the same Neuroticism facet scores that were found to decrease the most after psilocybin therapy in the present study (vulnerability anxiety, depression, and self-consciousness) were also the facets most strongly correlated with serotonin 2A receptor binding in a sample of 83 healthy volunteers 67. Also, the trait ‘dysfunctional attitude’, which is associated with pessimistic beliefs, has been associated with elevated serotonin 2A receptor levels in both depressed patients 72 and individuals recovered from depression 73. It has been suggested that serotonin 2A receptor upregulation is secondary to deficient stimulation with serotonin 72, which is consistent with the observation that downregulation of 2A receptors is associated with treatment with antidepressant drugs that elevate synaptic serotonin (Muguruza et al., 2014) To our knowledge, although Openness has not been directly associated with serotonin 2A receptor regulation, and 2A receptor levels did not appear to mediate an association between lifetime recreational use of psychedelics and elevated Openness scores (D. Erritzoe, J. Smith, P. M. Fisher, R. Carhart-Harris, V. G. Frokjaer, G. M. Knudsen, under review), it is possible that serotonin 2A receptor function is linked to Openness. Evidence from rodents suggests that cognitive flexibility is in part mediated via the 2A receptor 74, and, as discussed previously, a variety of 2A receptor agonists, such as psilocybin, DMT, and LSD, are associated with increased Openness, as well as increased cognitive flexibility and creative thinking 75-79. Indeed, serotonin and more specifically, serotonin 2A receptor stimulation has been associated with a relaxing of prior assumptions 80 – which would fit with the qualities of open-mindedness that characterize the Openness dimension. More investigations into the role of serotonin 2A receptors in mediating changes in Openness are therefore clearly warranted In summary, our study detected changes in personality measures from baseline to 3 months post psilocybin therapy in patients suffering major depression. Decreases in Neuroticism and (trend-level) increases in Conscientiousness were consistent with what has been found previously among patients responding to antidepressant treatment, whereas pronounced increases in Extraversion and, in particular, in Openness, might constitute an effect more specific to therapy with a psychedelic than with other antidepressant interventions. This hypothesis needs to be explored further in future controlled studies, however, as do the brain mechanisms of postpsychedelic personality change. Finally, some preliminary evidence was found that certain changes in personality were predicted by the nature of the acute experience under psilocybin, with acute Insight being particularly implicated.",
42,10.1093/ijnp/pyx036,"Here we investigated the neural correlates of the psychedelic “after-glow” induced by ayahuasca in healthy volunteers. Using 2 different MRI techniques, we evidenced significant neurometabolic and functional connectivity changes hours after the acute effects of ayahuasca had disappeared. These modifications were associated with immediate changes in the psychological sphere that were marginally maintained 2 months later. Our results replicate previous findings of enhanced mindfulness capacities, including increased “decentering,” and decreased judgmental and reactive attitudes during the post-acute phase of ayahuasca (Soler et al., 2016). Ayahuasca had the power to increase FFMQ, EQ, and Mindsens scores in individuals with already high baseline scores (Soler et al., 2014a). We also found increases in self-compassion, a previously unexplored facet in this context MRS showed neurometabolic changes in the PCC, a region rich in 5-HT2A receptors (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Beliveau et al., 2016) and a target region of psychedelics (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Valle et al., 2016). Glx levels in the PCC were lower in the post-acute assessment compared with baseline values, an effect that was however only marginally significant when corrected for multiple comparisons. We thus obtained partial evidence for the previously postulated involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the effects of psychedelics (Kłodzinska et al., 2002; Moreno et al., 2011) While we did not measure Glx levels during the acute psychedelic phase, our MRS findings are compatible with increased glutamate levels during the acute stage. Cortical glutamate levels increase in periods of external perceptual stimulation or during active cognitive tasks, while they fall below baseline levels during stimulation- or task-free periods (Mangia et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2015; Terhune et al., 2015). Also, acute psilocybin decreases brain aspartate (Preller et al., 2016), a neurotransmitter whose levels vary in an anticorrelated fashion with those of glutamate (Mangia et al., 2007). The post-acute Glx decreases in the PCC may result from increased excitatory activity during the acute phase. EEG and MEG studies in humans have shown a decrease of alpha oscillations, an inhibitory rhythm, in the parieto-occipital cortex during the acute effects of psychedelics (Kometer et al., 2013; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Valle et al., 2016) The post-acute Glx reductions in the PCC are also consistent with the observed reductions in Cr, NAA, and NAAG. Cr and N-acetyl compounds have been associated with metabolic activity, and NAAG has been directly linked to glutamatergic pathways (Rae, 2014). Additionally, the inverse correlation found between Cr and NAA-NAAG variations and scores on the HRS-Cognition subscale suggest a relationship between the intensity of acute effects and subsequent neurometabolic reductions. Neurometabolic changes may have contributed to the antidepressant effects reported for ayahuasca (Osório et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016). Depressed patients show abnormally high glutamate levels in the parieto-occipital cortex (Bhagwagar et al., 2007). Glutamate reductions in these areas correlate with clinical improvement in depression (Abdallah et al., 2014) The functional connectivity analysis also evidenced post-acute changes. Activity in the PCC and associated areas within the DMN (Raichle et al., 2001) has been associated with the personal sense of “self.” Psychedelics acutely loosen the boundaries of the “self” and increase the cross-talk between networks (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2016a). Here, we found a post-acute increase in coupling between the PCC and a subregion of the ACC pertaining to the TPNs While DMN and TPN activity are typically anticorrelated (Fox et al., 2005), psilocybin and LSD acutely increase DMN-TPN connectivity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013), and general inter-network connectivity (Roseman et al., 2014; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Our results suggest that cross-talk lingers beyond the acute stage and contributes to the “after-glow,” reflected as enhanced mindfulness capacities. Increased DMN-TPN connectivity correlated with reduced judgmental processing, inner reactivity, and increased self-kindness, providing a neurobiological basis for these modifications. Conventional mindfulness training also increases DMN-TPN connectivity (Doll et al., 2015) Visual areas showed increased coupling with the PCC but reduced with the ACC. This pattern suggests a greater interplay between internally generated visual information and spontaneous mind-wandering, and a reduction in cognitive control. These effects could explain increased phosphenes or “entoptic activity” persisting days after ayahuasca use (Frecska et al., 2012). A previous neuroimaging study found increased activity in the visual cortex under ayahuasca (de Araujo et al., 2012) The superior rostral ACC (srACC) seed also demonstrated increased functional coupling with parahippocampal, hippocampal, and amygdalar areas of the MTL. Prior studies had identified these areas as targets of acute ayahuasca (Riba et al., 2004, 2006; de Araujo et al., 2012). LSD acutely decreases fear recognition (Dolder et al., 2016), an effect mediated by the amygdala, and psilocybin increases synchronization between the hippocampus and the ACC (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014) Our data suggest that during the “after-glow” there is an enhanced interplay between the ACC, participating in executive tasks and in the binding of cognitive and emotional information, with limbic structures with key roles in emotion and memory processes. This finding is particularly relevant in the interpretation of the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca. Other researchers have found abnormal interactions between the srACC and the amygdala in depressed patients, possibly indicating decreased cognitive control over negative emotions (Fales et al., 2008) Our data show for the first time that the modification induced by psychedelics on brain dynamics leads to changes in its neurometabolic, functional, and psychological balance beyond the acute stage. As previously reported (Griffiths et al., 2011; Lebedev et al., 2016), the post-acute phase in our study showed positive psychological effects, highlighting the paradoxical nature of psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c). While the acute inebriation shares features with psychosis (Schmid et al., 2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c), psychedelics may lead to mid-term increases in psychological well-being. Increasing mindfulness capacities is clearly a desirable effect, especially in a psychotherapeutic context. Here post-acute scores were above values reported for meditators (Soler et al., 2014a), a population that also shows a pattern of decreased DMN-TPN anticorrelation (Brewer et al., 2011; Froeliger et al., 2012). Considering that maladaptive ruminations in depression have been associated with greater DMN “dominance” over TPN activity (Hamilton et al., 2011), our results provide another interesting link between psychedelic-induced neural modifications and the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca The post-acute phase of the psychedelic experience had received little attention from modern neuroscience. Although investigators had postulated the capacity of psychedelics to modulate brain plasticity (Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010), most research had assessed mid- and long-term effects only from a psychological perspective. The changes in personality and life attitudes reported in the 1960s (Savage et al., 1966; Pahnke, 1969) have recently been replicated as increases in trait openness (Griffiths et al., 2006; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c). Also, in a structural neuroimaging study of regular ayahuasca users, we found a cortical thinning of the PCC, the area showing neurometabolic decreases in the present study. PCC thinning was inversely correlated with increased self-transcendence, a personality trait closely related to openness (Bouso et al., 2015) Our MRS and connectivity data provide a biological basis for the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca (Osório et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016). Its potential to influence brain dynamics at multiple levels suggests its usefulness to treat disorders that are highly refractory to therapeutic intervention. Its combined effect on the psychological and neural spheres may be particularly well suited to treat addiction disorders (Fernández and Fábregas, 2014), where high impulsivity and self-centeredness coexist with alterations in brain function and structure (Vaquero et al., 2016) Our study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. We assessed a small sample of individuals before and after ayahuasca intake, with no control for placebo or time effects. The difficulties associated with Glx quantification allowed measurement in an even smaller sample. All participants had previous experience with ayahuasca, which may have biased our sample to individuals who usually experience positive effects after intake. Additionally, participants showed high baseline scores on several mindfulness facets. While this could be considered a limitation, it is also true that these capacities show “ceiling” effects and are difficult to increase in high scorers (Montero-Marin et al., 2016). The correlation analysis should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. Finally, our study investigated only the sub-acute stage of ayahuasca effects. The observed connectivity modifications cannot be interpreted as indicating persistent network changes. Future studies should consider using larger samples and double-blind, placebo-controlled designs. Also, the role of prior exposure to ayahuasca could be better established by recruiting less experienced or even ayahuasca-naive individuals To conclude, the present results indicate that ayahuasca and potentially other psychedelics induce neural modifications beyond the time frame of the acute inebriation. Neurometabolic decreases in the PCC and the increased inter-network connectivity were associated with enhanced mindfulness facets. These associations provide hints to a potential biological basis for the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca",
43,10.1007/s00213-017-4820-5,"Via an analysis of patient interviews, this study identified a number of ways in which music influenced the subjective experiences of patients receiving psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression. The most frequently reported themes relate to an intensification of emotions and mental imagery by music under psilocybin, complementing previous studies that demonstrated modulatory effects of LSD on music-evoked emotion (Kaelen et al. 2015, 2017) and music-evoked mental imagery (Kaelen et al. 2016) in healthy volunteers. By focussing on the phenomenology of the acute experience, the present study provided new insights into the role and importance of music in the context of psychedelic therapy. For example, the music appeared to be a significant source of guidance, creating a sense of grounding, as well as a sense of carrying the listener into different psychological places. Specific examples of this can be found in the following two excerpts The sad songs would bring painful memories on, more happy songs would make me think of a really good period in my life. Every new song could bring a different image I feel the music in large part drove a lot of the experience. Under the influence of psilocybin, the music absolutely takes over. Normally when I hear a piece of sad music, or happy music I respond through choice… but under psilocybin I felt almost that I had no choice but to go with the music. […] I did feel I was being held. And it did feel like the music opened [me] up to grief, and I just was very happy for that to happen. It wasn’t particularly pleasant in any way, but extraordinarily powerful. It took my thinking and my experience to uncomfortable places, but I was kind of reassured in the experience. There was something there that meant “I’m going to take you on a ride here, but I promise I won’t abandon you. It’s just going to be tough, and you know, you’re going through the grinder here, but you won’t be left in pieces.” That seemed to be… what the music was saying to me In contrast to the sense of guidance by the music were descriptions of the music providing a sense of misguidance. In these situations, the music was most often described as being dissonant with the patient’s emotions and thoughts. One example of the experience of misguidance and dissonance can be found in the following excerpt The light music at one point took me to a place where I thought I was safe, and it became unsafe, and the music was playing a trick with me, you know, sort of giving me a false sense of security. I can remember thinking “this is beautiful music, why am I going to this dark place?” It didn’t line up with what had gone on before. I just felt as I was being manipulated, being duped almost. The music lured me to this beautiful place, and then things started to become dark even with this beautiful music still playing One important observation is that effects of the music that were welcomed, included emotions such as increased grieving or tearfulness, and that an attitude of openness towards negative music-evoked emotions was frequently described as helpful in bringing to expression inner psychological conflicts that might then be resolved These experiences were grouped under the theme “openness to challenging experience feels therapeutic” and show similarities with recent qualitative research showing perceived therapeutic meaning in transient psychological struggle during psychedelic therapy (Belser et al. 2017; Swift et al. 2017). One example of this attitude of openness towards the music can be found in the following excerpt I can even view the negative moments as positive in a way because they served a purpose. The purpose was to sort of let me face the darkness, and my demons, I guess. It was beautiful at times, but also… yeah, the darker moments really helped to reflect on and connect with your unresolved shadows Contrasting such an attitude of openness to challenging experience is an attitude of resistance to the intensification effects of the music. This experience was characterised by not wanting the music or its effects and was named “resistance to intensification.” An example of this can be found in the following excerpt I worried that I let [the music] shape this sort of melancholy. There was resistance, massively, to everything, every sort of sensory input, I had a fearful response. I was afraid to open my eyes, I was afraid to do anything, I was afraid that this sort of music was the last thing I’d ever hear The study also shed light on how different musical styles and the design of the music playlist were experienced. The choice of the music and the design of the music playlist were overall well-appreciated, with the most frequently appreciated musical genres being ethnic-, vocal-, and (neo-) classical music. Appreciation was also expressed for the design of the playlist, in particular for the calming (ambient) music, which was particularly present during the early (pre-onset and early ascent) and the final (return) phases, and at periods during peak, while more emotionally evocative music being reserved for the peak phase. This indirectly supports the therapists’ views that that an optimal playlist design is characterised by a music genre selection that is structured to match the different phases of drug experience Strong disliking of the music selection was rare, but when this did occur it proved insightful about the possible functions of music selection: Typically, disliking of the music seemed to be associated with either a “diminishment” of psilocybin’s subjective effects, accompanied by unpleasant feelings (such as discomfort and irritation), and with an attitude of resistance, characterised by an attempt to psychologically reject and distance oneself from the music, such as detailed in the following excerpt The music blocked my experience and feelings. A sense of irritation, frustration, and sense of lowering mood. The majority of the songs were not my kind of music, I can’t sit with that music … I have to leave the room. I was sort of feeling bad, because I wanted to work with it. I sensed the potential for a really profound experience. I couldn’t meet that potential with music that I felt was quite mediocre. To me it didn’t feel real, so I felt quite torn As outlined above, notable polarities were observed in the music experience, such as the music being either liked or disliked, the music being either resonant or dissonant with the patient’s experience, and the patient being either open or resistant to the influence of the music. These variables (liking, resonance, and openness) positively predicted the extent to which patients reported having mystical experiences (a factor defined as the experience of unity, blissful emotionality, and spirituality). In addition, resonance and openness, but not liking, predicted the extent to which people reported insightfulness (a factor defined by having inventive ideas, feelings of profoundness, insights, and the experience of vivid personal memories or mental images). Drug intensity, on the other hand, also correlated with other aspects of the psilocybinexperience, such as impaired cognition and audio-visual perception changes. It must be noted that liking, resonance, and openness were highly correlated and thus likely represent one construct. The absence of a significant correlation between music liking and reported insightfulness may therefore be due to a lack of statistical power The selective association of the music experience with mystical experience and insightfulness, and not with other subjective experiences, supports the original motivations to include music in psychedelictherapy, i.e. to promote the occurrence of therapeutically meaningful experiences. Modern studies have confirmed that psilocybin can reliably facilitate mystical experiences (Griffiths et al. 2011, 2016), and these experiences have been associated with sustained positive changes in behaviour and personality (MacLean et al. 2011) and with positive therapy outcomes (Garcia-Romeu et al. 2014; Griffiths et al. 2016; Roseman et al. 2017; Ross et al. 2016). Although these studies incorporated music-listening in combination with psilocybin, this study is the first to demonstrate that the music experience during these sessions relates to the occurrence of mystical experiences. A positive relationship was also found between the music experience and reductions in depression 1 week after the psilocybin experience. Importantly, reductions in depression were not related to the intensity of the drug effects. This finding indicates that it is not merely the drug effect in isolation, but an interaction between the drug and the music on subjective experience that promotes positive therapeutic outcome A principal effect of psychedelics is that they temporarily dysregulate brain mechanisms that normally regulate emotion(Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2016b; Muthukumaraswamy et al. 2013; Tagliazucchi et al. 2016), and this could underlie the enhanced emotional responsiveness to emotionally evocative stimuli reported here as elsewhere (Carhart-Harris et al. 2012b; Kaelen et al. 2015, 2017; Quednow et al. 2012; Vollenweider et al. 2007). The notion that accepting and moving through challenging emotions are important for psychotherapeutic change is central to many psychotherapeutic models (Greenberg and Pascual-Leone 2006), has empirical support (Whelton 2004), and been noted by other psychedelic therapy studies (Belser et al. 2017; Swift et al. 2017; Watts et al. 2017). In psychedelic therapy, the function of psychedelics may be to ease the relinquishment of psychological control (i.e. ego dissolution and enhanced suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014)), thereby allowing a fuller and freer (i.e. less inhibited) expression of emotionality. The enhanced receptivity to music, in turn, may play the important function of activating emotionality, thoughts, and memories that are most personally salient. Thereby, music can guide the patient’s experience into directions that are most therapeutically significant. One key difference between psychedelic therapy and other forms of psychotherapy (and conventional pharmacotherapy) may be the capacity of psychedelics and music to rapidly facilitate deeply felt and personally meaningful emotionality It is worth considering that these findings show a remarkable congruency with the theoretical frameworks and patient experiences of “introspective” forms of music therapy, where music is utilised as the means to provide an experience that is thought to help the listener examine and change his/her relationship with themselves (Abbott 2005; Albornoz 2013; Summer 1992, 2011). This includes the use of music to evoke intense emotional experiences (Albornoz 2013), as well as a way to provide a “holding environment,”which feels “safe and secure” to express and experience new aspects of oneself (Carroll 2011; Schulberg 1999). Therapeutic effects of music are widely reported in literature and utilised across different health care disciplines (Finch and Moscovitch 2016; Mondanaro et al. 2017; Pavlov et al. 2017). The present findings therefore engender the view that psychedelic therapy utilises therapeutic effects of music that are enhanced via an interaction between the drug and the music Due to the prominence of music-listening in psychedelic therapy, increasing the knowledge of the appropriate therapeutic use of music in psychedelic therapy is important. This becomes particularly critical when psychedelic therapy is implemented on increasingly larger scales. The therapeutic influence of music has been referred to as being of “profound significance”(Bonny and Pahnke 1972), and several authors emphasised the care needed in selecting appropriate music, playing this music at the right circumstances, and within a personalised patient-centred format (Grof 1980; Hoffer 1965). The present study provides support for these views, by showing that when the music was experienced as dissonant with the unfolding experience, disliked, and rejected (resistance), therapeutic outcomes suffered. In contrast, when the music was in resonance with the patient’s experience, liked, and accepted (openness), therapeutic outcomes were most positive These music experience variables in this study (resonance, liking, and openness) correlated with each other, suggesting that they represent a single construct within the music experience that is associated with positive therapy outcomes. Liking of music is usually characterised as a mixture of genre appreciation and aesthetic judgements (Juslin 2013; Juslin and Västfjäll 2008; Juslin et al. 2016; North and Hargreaves 1997), and music liking may represent a basic pre-requisite for music to evoke personally meaningful emotionality. In addition, some music styles and acoustic properties may be more suitable for the conscious states induced by psychedelics than others. The patient’s attitude, in turn, appears to require a sufficient degree of openness to the music-evoked experience, and this may imply not only a state of surrender but also a pro-active and curious engagement with the therapeutic content that emerges This hypothetical framework holds that an optimal music experience (style liking, music’s resonance, and openness to music) creates an optimal climate for the expression of meaningful therapeutic content, characterised by the sensation of being on a personal journey, with a spontaneous and often intense emergence of personally meaningful imagery, thoughts, and emotionality. This optimal music experience construct may be a critical pre-requisite, and when it is not met adequately, is likely to result in the patient to distance from the music experience (resistance), characterised by feelings of discomfort, and a diminishment of personally meaningful imagery, thoughts, and emotionality (i.e. the absence of the sense of being on a journey). Given the patient’s experience is highly individual and dynamic, this finding suggests that the adaptation of the music during psychedelic therapy sessions may be critical at times, in order to provide adequate therapeutic support conditions, or prevent possible counter-therapeutic experiences: an idea that was often emphasised by early pioneers of psychedelic therapy (Bonny and Pahnke 1972; Grof 1980; Hoffer 1965) In this framework, the experience of resistance and dislike by the listener may be regarded as an important indicator for the therapist of music’s failure to act therapeutically, and the type of intervention needed to restore music’s therapeutic function may be determined by one central question the therapists may need to clarify, i.e. what is the source of the resistance or dislike? The therapists bear a responsibility to ensure the music styles are sufficiently liked, via thoughtful music selection, and that resonance is maximised by providing an attunement of the music to the patient’s personal and dynamically unfolding experience, via thoughtful playlistdesign and adaptation of the music when needed. However, in addition, it may occur that the music-evoked experience is rich with therapeutically meaningful content, yet the experience may be emotionally challenging, resulting in similar expressions of resistance. In these scenarios, the therapists may instead need to provide adequate therapeutic support for the patient to feel safe and motivated to engage in exploring and expressing the present challenging feeling states, of which the meanings may not always be immediately clear","In patients with treatment-resistant depression treated with psilocybin, music was described as having a substantial influence on their therapeutic experience, and selective correlations between the musicexperience and the occurrence of mystical experiences and insightfulness during sessions support this. Patients’ experience of the music, but not drug intensity, was predictive of reductions in depression 1 week later, suggesting that music plays a central mediating role in psychedelic therapy.These findings motivate greater appreciation of music as a key variable in psychedelic therapy and highlight the need for further research to better understand how music interacts with certain personality traits and psychological states to influence the acute experience and longer-term outcomes of psychedelic therapy"
44,10.1177/0269881116678781,"The CEQ was developed from responses to an internet survey of challenging experiences, and the stand-alone CEQ was validated in responses to a separate internet survey of challenging experiences. The seven factors of the CEQ display a simple factor structure, have high face validity, and represent a wide sampling of challenging aspects of psychedelic experience (referred to as “challenging experiences” for brevity) that aligns well with previous reports of presenting symptoms of acute adverse reactions to hallucinogenic substances (Cohen, 1960; Strassman, 1984; Ungerleider, Fisher, & Fuller, 1966; Ungerleider, Fisher, Fuller, & Caldwell, 1968). This includes affective (fear and grief)physiological (physical distress), and cognitive/affective (feelings of isolation, paranoia, feelings of insanity or loss of sanity, and the subjective experience of death) categories of subjective experience. Internal and external validity of the CEQ The factor structure of the CEQ was identified and confirmed in Study 1 within separate sub-samples of the data, and was shown to be invariant across levels of gender and struggle with psychiatric illnesses before the reported challenging experience. The factor structure of the stand-alone CEQ was validated in Study 2. While demographic variables did not differ in extreme ways between Study 1 and Study 2, they all differed significantly. Factorial invariance between Study 1 and Study 2 in spite of demographic differences provides evidence for internal validity of the CEQ and makes a case for the resilience of the CEQ factor structure. Participants provided ratings of the degree of difficulty of the challenging experience that they reported. Scores on the fear, grief, insanity, and death factors of the CEQ were consistently positively associated with these difficulty ratings in both Study 1 and Study 2, providing evidence for external validity of the CEQ. The experiences represented by the items in these four factors may constitute the core of what may be considered a challenging experience, while the remaining three factors may represent less reliable aspects of challenging experience. Differences in factor scores between samples in four scales (fear, physical distress, insanity, and paranoia) were observed (Table 7), and should be explored further in future studies. Greater fear and physical distress scores, and lower paranoia and insanity scores, were observed in Study 2 when compared to Study 1. These differences may be attributable to differences between Study 1 and Study 2 samples in demographics, but it is equally if not more compelling to consider that additional factors that were not controlled in these samples, such as psilocybin dose and details of set and setting, may be associated with differences in CEQ scores. An accepted clinical definition of “paranoia” is “unfounded fears that others intend harm to the individual” (Freeman et al., 2015). While one item of the paranoia scale of the CEQ is consistent with this definition (“feeling that people were plotting against you”), the other (“experience of antagonism toward people around you”), while likely related, is not closely consistent with this definition. Thus, the CEQ paranoia scale may be viewed as a crude measure of the clinical construct of “paranoia”, and the external validity of the paranoia scale may be somewhat restricted by this limitation Previous studies of the subjective effects of psilocybin have used ratings of the meaningfulness and spiritual significance of the experience to provide a very general characterization of the effects of psilocybin, in relation to other experiences that a volunteer has had (Griffiths et al., 2006; Griffiths et al., 2008; Griffiths et al., 2011). A consistent finding has been that moderate to high doses of psilocybin (20+ mg/70 kg) occasion experiences that are frequently rated in the top 5 most meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of a participant’s life. Participants have also attributed positive change in wellbeing to their psilocybin experience, and this change in well-being has been shown to correlate positively with mystical experience (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2015) and egodissolution (Nour et al., 2016). Preliminary research further suggests positive psilocybinoccasioned behavior change in the context of addiction treatment (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Garcia-Romeu, Griffiths, & Johnson, 2015; Johnson et al., 2014), providing a general characterization of the longer-term impact of these experiences. The associations between CEQ factor scores and the overall impact ratings of meaningfulness, spiritual significance, and change in well-being were assessed in the current samples. Scores on the insanity and death factors of the CEQ were positively associated with ratings of the meaningfulness of the reported experience in both Study 1 and Study 2. Scores on the fear factor were negatively associated with spiritual significance, while scores on the death factor were positively associated with spiritual significance of reported experiences in both studies. To the extent that individuals might construe or relate the loss of self-referential processing that is often reported during mystical experiences as feeling as though they are losing a sense of sanity or experiencing their own death, an encounter with this facet of challenging experience may be expected to covary with both the meaningfulness and the spiritual significance of an experience. The subjective experience of one’s own death and loss of control of the mind might somehow allow for the type of unity experience that leads to spiritual and meaningful experiences. However, scores on the death factor of the CEQ were negatively associated with change in well-being attributed to challenging experiences. While the experience of ego dissolution (Nour et al., 2016) and mystical experience (Barrett et a., 2015) are positively associated with well-being, it is not completely clear that the items of the ‘death’ subscale of the CEQ (“Profound experience of your own death” and “Feel as if dead or dying”) are collinear with either mystical experience or ego dissolution. The positive association between wellbeing and both mystical experience and ego-dissolution, contrasted against the negative association between wellbeing and the ‘death’ scale of the CEQ in both Study 1 and Study 2, suggests that there may be something unique about the subjective experience described as ‘death’ or ‘dying’ during a challenging experience that may detract from wellbeing, and this may have implications for therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics in clinical trials. Thus, future work may benefit from further elucidating the relationship between ego dissolution or mystical experience and the ‘death’ factor of the CEQ. Scores on the fear factor of the CEQ were associated with an increase in well-being attributed to challenging experiences and negatively predicted meaningfulness and spiritual significance of challenging experiences. Fear may generally detract from a spiritual experience, but the crucible of panic during a challenging experience might still lead to positive outcomes.","The Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) as validated in this report may serve as a valuable tool for characterizing psychologically difficult aspects of experiences occasioned by psilocybin and, very likely, by other classic hallucinogens. Better understanding of challenging experiences with classic hallucinogens may increase the precision of our understanding of both the psychological nature of and neural mechanisms underlying the effects of these drugs. Understanding challenging experiences with classic hallucinogens may also facilitate the optimization of therapeutic application of drugs within this class. Thus, the Challenging Experience Questionnaire developed in this report makes a significant contribution to methods of assessment of acute psychologically adverse reactions to psilocybin, and with further validation, will likely make a significant contribution to methods of assessment of such experiences with other classic hallucinogens"
45,10.1080/17512433.2018.1511424,"In the present systematic review, we analyzed 10 systematic reviews covering a wide variety of topics related to the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of classical or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics in the treatment of anxiety, mood, and substance-use disorders. Broadly, these topics basically included therapeutic effects and acute and long-term safety. Overall, these systematic reviews suggest that these substances have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive properties, and a good safety and tolerability profile However, included studies comprised a single meta-analysis of the effects of LSD on alcoholic patients [50], and several studies described in the reviews were observational studies of ritual ayahuasca use or open-label studies with ayahuasca, LSD, or psilocybin involving few volunteers [5,7,9,52–55]. Moreover, the number of RCTs in most reviews was small (1 to 10), with three reviews reporting a single RCT [7,50,51], with two of these trials being performed with a small number of healthy volunteers Furthermore, not all drugs showed the same level of evidence. For instance, the higher level of evidence was found for the antiaddictive effects of LSD in patients with alcohol dependence (with six RCTs) and for the anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of psilocybin in patients with advanced-stage cancer and nonmalignant life-threatening diseases (with three RCTs), while evidence for the antidepressive effects of LSD was found in only one RCT in patients with advanced-stage cancer and nonmalignant life-threatening diseases. However, studies with LSD and alcoholism were conducted from 1966 to 1970, while the psilocybin and LSD studies for existential anxiety and depression were performed from 2011 to 2016. This difference in time could induce bias regarding diagnosis criteria and the psychometric validity of the instruments used to measure the subjective/clinical outcomes in older LSD studies. Moreover, LSD studies had more heterogeneity regarding therapeutic techniques and drug doses. Therefore, although the literature on LSD was the only subjected to a meta-analysis and showed promising results, new RCTs are needed to replicate these findings In the case of psilocybin, the available evidence shows that this compound can be an effective treatment for patients with existential anxiety and depression. Indeed, a recent open-label study showed that a single dose of psilocybin induced rapid (1 week) and sustained (3 months) antidepressive and anxiolytic effects in 12 patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression [76]. The next steps would be to perform RCTs for depressed patients and to compare psilocybin with other antidepressive/anxiolytic drugs. Indeed, new RCTs covering these topics are being planned or are already being conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03181529, NCT03380442, NCT03429075) Moreover, future studies should also compare different therapeutic interventions associated with the administration of psilocybin and other serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics, since it still not known neither if the therapeutic effects of these drugs are increased by the inclusion of psychotherapy nor which psychotherapeutic approach would be the most effective. This is especially relevant in the case of ayahuasca, since in the open-label study with 17 patients with treatment-resistant MDD, no psychotherapeutic intervention was used before, during, or after the experimental sessions, and the results were significant, rapid (hours/days), and sustained (21 days), and were also evident in changes in blood perfusion (SPECT) [60,61]. Furthermore, these results were recently replicated in a RCT with 29 patients with treatment-resistant MDD in which no psychotherapeutic intervention was used (different from the open-label study, a predefined music playlist was used in this RCT): compared with placebo, single-dose ayahuasca administration was associated with rapid (24 h) and sustained (7 days) significant antidepressant effects [77]. Thus, future studies should investigate the role of different psychotherapeutic techniques and music in the therapeutic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics Among the different therapeutic effects, the lowest level of evidence of efficacy was found for the antiaddictive properties of ayahuasca and psilocybin, where only observational (ayahuasca) and open-label (psilocybin) studies were described. In the case of ayahuasca, one systematic review reported evidence from animal studies that this complex mix of substances and its isolated alkaloids have antiaddictive effects in studies using drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and alcohol [47]. However, this descriptive review was excluded from the preset text because it did not report any RCT. Thus, the next step would be to perform such trial in patients with substance-use disorders. In the case of psilocybin, new RCTs are being planned or are already being conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02037126, NCT02061293) Some observational studies of ritual ayahuasca use and experimental studies with psilocybin and LSD with healthy volunteers showed positive and significative changes in personality measures [9]. In observational studies, these changes often paralleled the reports of therapeutic effects. For example, ritual ayahuasca users reported reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and in the use of drugs such as alcohol, tobacco, and psychostimulants, and also described reduced impulsivity and novelty seeking and increased spirituality. The experimental data with LSD and psilocybin reported increases in openness, but the evidence is mixed and inconsistent [11,78,79]. Therefore, the next step would be the performance of new RCTs to try to replicate these results Regarding adverse effects, three descriptive systematic reviews focused specifically on the adverse effects associated with ayahuasca and its alkaloids [51–53], and all showed observational, experimental, or clinical evidence of good safety and tolerability when used in controlled settings (ritual, experimental, or clinical). In fact, observational studies of ritual use showed the first evidence of possible anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects of ayahuasca, which were subsequently observed both in animal models and in clinical trials [5,47,53–55]. A descriptive systematic review excluded from our analysis (because it did not report any RCT) reported three case series and two case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca intake and three case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with smoked DMT ([48]; also reported in [51]). Several reports described subjects with a personal and possibly a family history of psychotic disorders and/or concomitant use of other drugs. However, in experimental, open-label, and RCTs, the most common observed adverse reactions were transient and moderate increases in blood pressure and heart rate, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort and vomiting, and less commonly transient anxiety- and psychotic-like reactions [24,60,61]. We are not aware of any controlled study of ayahuasca (or LSD and psilocybin) with healthy volunteers or patients in which a prolonged psychotic reaction happened. Inclusion of a psychiatric screening to exclude individuals with a personal or family history of any psychotic illness or nonpsychotic mania seems to significantly reduce the possibility of such adverse reactions in controlled settings of hallucinogen/psychedelic research. However, patients with these characteristics are common in psychiatric clinics. Thus, this is an important limitation in the possible clinical use of hallucinogens/psychedelics Regarding adverse effects of LSD and psilocybin, most studies described in the systematic reviews reported data from controlled experimental and/or clinical settings, where these drugs showed a good safety and tolerability profile, with transient adverse effects such as anxiety- and psychotic-like reactions, transient, moderate increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, headaches, nausea, or vomiting [5,7,9,50,53,54,55,56; see also 37,80]. None of the studies reported cases of prolonged psychosis",
46,10.1007/s00213-018-4988-3,"The primary aim of the present study was to assess sub-acute and long-term impact of ayahuasca use on affect and cognitive thinking style. A total of 57 visitors of ayahuasca ceremonies in Colombia and the Netherlands consented to participate in this observational study and were asked to complete subjective questionnaires and a creative thinking task prior to an ayahuasca ceremony, the day after, and about 4 weeks later. Baseline and sub-acute assessments were conducted on-site whereas the 4-week follow-up was conducted online. The 4- week follow-up was completed by about 54% of the participants. Relative to baseline, ratings of depression and stress significantly decreased after the ayahuasca ceremony and these changes persisted for at least 4 weeks. Likewise, convergent thinking improved after the ayahuasca ceremony even at the 4-week follow-up. Satisfaction with life and several aspects of mindfulness increased the day after the ceremony, but these changes failed to reach significance 4 weeks after. Changes in affect, satisfaction with life, and mindfulness were significantly related to the level of ego dissolution experienced during the ayahuasca ceremony. Subjective ratings of stress and depression significantly decreased by 36 and 46% respectively during the day after the ayahuasca ceremony. Ratings of stress and depression remained significantly lower throughout the following month, suggesting that a single ayahuasca ceremony can bring about changes in affect that last for a prolonged period of time. Antidepressant properties of ayahuasca are not unexpected given that ayahuasca brews contain β-carboline alkaloids that act as MAO-A inhibitors which are known for their antidepressant actions (Finberg and Rabey 2016). Sub-acute reductions in depressive symptoms have been reported previously in first time (Barbosa et al. 2005) and regular ayahuasca users (Bouso et al. 2012). A pilot, open-label trial in six patients suffering from recurrent or major depressive disorder however showed significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after intake of a single ayahuasca dose (Osório et al. 2015). These data were recently replicated in a larger open-label trial that involved 17. depressed patients (Sanches et al. 2016). Together, these studies support the notion that single doses of ayahuasca can reduce symptomatology in depressed patients as well as in a broad spectrum of users who display non-pathological levels of depression and that such changes persist over a prolonged period of time. The mechanism underlying the long-term effects of ayahuasca on affect is presently unknown. Animal studies suggest that Banisteriopsis caapi preparations produce antidepressant activity through hippocampal neurogenesis (Farzin and Mansouri 2006; Fortunato et al. 2010). A recent study demonstrated that harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline, the three main alkaloids present in the Banisteriopsis caapi,stimulate adult neurogenesis in vitro using hippocampal progenitor cells from adult mice (Morales-Garcia et al. 2017). Neurogenesis has also been suggested to underlie the acute and long-term antidepressant properties of other psychedelic compounds such as ketamine (Duman and Aghajanian 2012; Ma et al. 2017) and psilocybin (Catlow et al. 2013; Idell et al. 2017). Neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity may play a crucial role in how neural circuits regulate their excitability and connectivity and may link the neurobiology of depression to the therapeutic effects of glutamatergic drugs such as ketamine (Abdallah et al. 2015). In that respect, it is of interest that changes in glutamate transmission following ayahuasca ceremonies have been associated to improvements in certain aspect of mindfulness as well (Sampedro et al. 2017). Ayahuasca also produced significant sub-acute improvements in subjective ratings of mindfulness and satisfaction with life. Subjects felt that they were more non-judgmental, acted with more awareness, and were more observant on the day following ayahuasca. Similar findings have been reported in an observational study that compared aspects of mindfulness before and 24 h after an ayahuasca ceremony using the same FFMQ questionnaire (Soler et al. 2016). In the present study, ratings of mindfulness and satisfaction with life increased by 5–8%, relative to baseline. On average, similar increments in mindfulness were obtained at 4 weeks after the ayahuasca ceremony, but this time, these no longer achieved statistical significance. It should be noted that ayahuasca-induced changes in mindfulness were much smaller than changes in symptoms of depression and stress. Consequently, the loss of statistical power caused by the drop in the response rate at the 4-week follow-up may have affected the probability of detecting changes as assessed with the FFMQ and SWL more than those assessed with the DASS, because changes in the former were small. Exposure to the ayahuasca ceremony also increased convergent thinking as assessed with the picture concept task. The number of correctly detected associations increased with 9% sub-acutely and with 29% at the 4-week follow-up. At the latter time point, the increase in cognitive performance also reached statistical significance. The PCT task has previously been used in an observational ayahuasca study to show that the brew increases performance at the divergent, creative thinking assignment but decreases performance in convergent thinking assignments (Kuypers et al. 2016). Data from these studies however are not necessarily conflicting. In the latter study, PCT performance was assessed during the acute phase of the ayahuasca experience (i.e., 2 h after intake), whereas in the present study, PCT performance was assessed sub-acutely and a month after the ceremony. It is conceivable that divergent, flexible thinking will improve during the acute psychedelic, modified state of consciousness that ayahuasca produces but not thereafter. Convergent thinking may not prosper during a psychedelic experience but may improve afterwards because it relies on mindfulness capabilities such as acting with awareness that contribute to optimization of cognitive functioning (Lebudaa et al. 2015). Increments in convergent thinking may therefore coincide with improvements in mindfulness that were observed in the present sample of ayahuasca users. It might be argued that post-ayahuasca changes in affect and thinking style that were observed in the present study are not related to a pharmacological effect of ayahuasca but due to uncontrolled confounders such as psychological expectations of participants prior to and after the ayahuasca ceremony. For example, participants may have been more stressed in anticipation of the ayahuasca ceremony which would explain why stress levels are higher at baseline, prior to the ceremony. Ideally, one would need to include a placebo group to control for the potential bias of expectation. This however is often impossible in observational studies that aim to assess the influence of ayahuasca in naturalistic environments. Yet, there are several strong indicators in the present study that suggest that changes in affect and thinking were directly related to the intake of ayahuasca. First, it was demonstrated that improvements in affect and cognition were significantly correlated with the strengths of ego dissolution during the ayahuasca experience. Higher ratings of ego dissolutions were associated with stronger reductions in symptoms of depression and stress and with improvements in mindfulness and satisfaction with life. This strongly suggests that changes in mood and thinking were intrinsically related to the actual ayahuasca experience. Second, anxiety levels were very low during baseline and follow-up sessions, which suggest that anxiety levels in anticipation of the ayahuasca ceremony were negligible. Finally, improvements in affect and cognition occurred independent of the previous ayahuasca experience of participants. The aforementioned rules out the possibility that changes were only apparent in first-time users who might be overly stressed by the novelty of the ayahuasca experience. In sum, this study presents supporting evidence for subacute and long-term improvements in affect and cognitive thinking style in non-pathological participants of ayahuasca ceremonies. Moreover, it was shown that improvements in affect and mindfulness are larger in participants who experience strong levels of ego dissolution during the acute phase of ayahuasca exposure. These data highlight the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as depression",
47,10.1177/2045125316689030,"The present systematic review reported evidence from case reports and case series associating ayahuasca or DMT intake with psychotic episodes enduring more than the expected time of action of each drug To the best of our knowledge, there is no published report of prolonged psychotic reactions associated with the use of ayahuasca in controlled settings [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. In these settings, volunteers are screened for a possible psychiatric history or a current psychiatric diagnosis, including psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, or a history of mania or hypomania induced by antidepressant or substance use [Riba et al. 2006; de Araujo et al. 2012; Osório et al. 2015; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; dos Santos et al. 2016b; Sanches et al. 2016]. The performance of a psychiatric screening before experimental or clinical use of hallucinogens is essential to reduce the possible occurrence of adverse reactions [Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. Therefore, a possible explanation for the occurrence of psychotic episodes could be the presence of previous psychiatric disorders Indeed, in the UDV case series [Lima et al. 2002; Lima and Tófoli, 2011], several psychotic episodes associated with ritual ayahuasca intake were related to previous psychiatric diagnoses or current symptomatology, including psychotic symptoms/disorders. Moreover, in the manic episode associated with ayahuasca intake, the subject had a family history of bipolar disorder and a personal history of hypomanic episodes [Szmulewicz et al. 2015]. Interestingly, acute ayahuasca administration to depressed patients screened for bipolar disorder or a history of mania/hypomania was not associated with increases in manic symptomatology [Osório et al. 2015; Sanches et al. 2016] In both the UDV case series [Lima et al. 2002; Lima and Tófoli, 2011] and in the case reports [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008] ayahuasca intake was also associated with psychotic episodes in people without a personal or family psychiatric history. However, in the case report, the use of other drugs (e.g. cannabis and other hallucinogens) complicates the assessment of the possible role of ayahuasca in the psychotic episode, and in the UDV case series no details are given regarding isolated cases, limiting their evaluation. In any case, the overall incidence of psychotic episodes in the UDV context seems to be rare. Gable reported that such cases represented a rate of less than 0.1% (0.052–0.096%) [Gable, 2007], which is comparable with the data reported by Cohen regarding controlled LSD administration [Cohen, 1960] Regarding DMT, we are also not aware of any published reports describing prolonged psychotic reactions associated with experimental/controlled DMT administration [e.g. Strassman et al. 1994, 1996; Daumann et al. 2008, 2010]. Volunteers in these studies are also psychiatrically screened for psychotic disorders before drug administration, thus limiting the possible occurrence of adverse reactions with psychotic features [Strassman, 1984; Daumann et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2008; Daumann et al. 2010; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. Like ayahuasca, in two of the case reports associated with smoked DMT, the subjects had a previous hypomanic/psychotic mania episode [Umut et al. 2011; Paterson et al. 2015], and in one case, the subject had a family history of psychotic disorder [Warren et al. 2013]. Furthermore, in all three cases the subjects used other drugs as well, especially cannabis. Like other hallucinogens, it seems that people with a personal or family psychiatric history of psychotic or manic episodes should avoid DMT intake [Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016] It is not clear why some people suffer prorogued psychotic reactions to ayahuasca or DMT. Mental health assessments of long-term ritual ayahuasca use do not report increased psychopathology in these population, and ayahuasca intake could even be related to better mental health [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. However, studies with experimented ayahuasca users could be biased by the fact that these people are already adapted to ayahuasca, having used this substance for several years or even decades in some cases [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. Therefore, it is possible that people that have adverse reactions to ayahuasca during their first experiences do not continue to use this hallucinogen anymore, and will not be present in studies assessing the mental health of long-term users. Previous prospective studies assessing the effects of a first ayahuasca intake in naïve users after 2 weeks [Barbosa et al. 2005] and 6 months [Barbosa et al. 2009] did not report adverse reactions with psychotic features, but observed reductions in psychiatric symptoms. More prospective studies following novice ayahuasca users for longer periods are need to better understand the effects of ayahuasca, both the negative and the therapeutic Nevertheless, the case reports describing the occurrence of psychotic episodes among the UDV members show that a minority of individuals may be predisposed to such experiences even in ritual settings. People with previous psychiatric diagnoses of psychotic disorders (schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders, psychotic depression or mania) or with current psychotic symptomatology seem to be the individuals with more predisposition to an adverse reaction with psychotic features, both for ayahuasca and DMT intake. Therefore, both in experimental/clinical and ritual settings, a previous psychiatric screening should be performed and individuals with such characteristics should avoid ayahuasca intake. This is similar for other hallucinogens [Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. Indeed, in the case report described by dos Santos and Strassman, the second psychotic episode could be the result of both sensitization (increased susceptibility to the psychoactive effects of ayahuasca/DMT) and predisposition (increased tendency to suffer another psychotic reaction after a first-episode psychosis) induced by the first episode 1 year before [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008] The cases of people that had a psychotic episode with ayahuasca or DMT but that the subjects had no personal or family psychiatric history are more difficult to interpret. In the case of DMT, all reports described subjects with past or ongoing psychiatric symptomatology and use of other drugs that could also induce psychotic symptoms/disorders (e.g. cannabis and other hallucinogens). The case described by dos Santos and Strassman with ayahuasca also had an association with cannabis and other hallucinogens, even considering the absence of a personal or previous psychiatric history for the subject [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. Future studies should record not only the psychiatric history of the participants, but also the drug use history with detailed information on the type of drug used and the frequency and duration of such use. For instance, in two of the cases related to DMT the psychotic episode was apparently associated with an increase in the frequency/duration of DMT use, among other factors [Warren et al. 2013; Paterson et al. 2015]. Radiolabeled DMT remained for 7 days after injection in the rabbit brain [Vitale et al. 2011], suggesting the possibility that continuous use of DMT could increase brain levels of this compound over time, maybe reaching levels high enough to induce psychotic experiences, especially in predisposed individuals Unfortunately, although the UDV case series have described several psychotic episodes, they lack the detailed information present in the descriptions of the case reports. Thus, the UDV data is limited regarding the details of the psychiatric and drug use history of the subjects. It would be interesting to further explore the UDV data, and to assess if the religious setting of organized groups such as the UDV has any positive influence in how the person suffering a psychotic episode in that context copes with that experience Individuals predisposed to psychotic episodes after ayahuasca/DMT intake could share some genetic/metabolic characteristics that predispose them to such experiences. The so-called ‘transmethylation hypothesis’ suggests that an enzymatic/metabolic alteration could induce the organism to increase the synthesis of endogenous hallucinogenic compounds such as DMT, thus inducing psychosis/schizophrenia [Gillin et al. 1978; Barker et al. 1981; Ciprian-Ollivier and Cetkovich-Bakmas, 1997; Pomilio et al. 1999; Vitale et al. 2010; Barker et al. 2012; Grammenos and Barker, 2015]. However, although DMT is indeed an endogenous compound that has been detected in the human cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine [Barker et al. 2012], and some studies did find increased concentrations of DMT and related compounds (5-hydroxy-DMT, 5-methoxy-DMT) in the body fluids of psychotic/schizophrenic patients and other psychiatric patients [Barker et al. 2012], results are inconclusive and the transmethylation hypothesis is still under debate [Barker et al. 2012; Grammenos and Barker, 2015]. Moreover, although several authors have speculated on other possible physiological roles of endogenous DMT and related compounds in our organism, including regulation/production of dreams, near-death experiences, and mystical states [Callaway, 1988; Strassman, 2001], anxiolytic effects [Jacob and Presti, 2005], and tissue protection/regeneration and immune regulation [Frecska et al. 2013, 2016; Szabo et al. 2014], we still do not know what DMT is doing in our body. Additional research in this area is needed to better understand the presence of these compounds in humans There may be at least two explanations to understand the psychotic crisis reported in this paper, one psychological and another physiological. In the first case, maybe the subjects faced psychological content that unbalanced them. In the two cases in which we had personal contact with the subjects, they became paranoid, thinking that the people surrounding them wanted to harm them. At the same time, both subjects reacted quite well to treatment with atypical antipsychotics. In the case reported by dos Santos and Strassman, the subject apparently only became psychotic after taking drugs with hallucinogenic (ayahuasca, 2C-I) or hallucinogenic-like (MDMA) effects [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. Although MDMA is not considered a classic or serotonergic hallucinogen, it has hallucinogenic-like effects and may influence cortical 5-HT2A receptors [Mueller et al. 2016]. Moreover, the subject was successfully treated in all occasions with risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic that act as an antagonist of dopamine D1–2 receptors and of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The unpublished case report involving ayahuasca also described the effective (although transitory) use of risperidone, as well as one of the case reports involving DMT [Umut et al. 2011]. Thus, although a possible involvement of the dopaminergic system in the psychotic effects of hallucinogens cannot be ruled out, it seems that the psychotic crisis induced by ayahuasca, DMT, and other serotonergic hallucinogens may have their cause in their action on cortical 5-HT2A receptors. Solid evidence supporting this idea includes the fact that three of the reviewed cases reported successful use of an atypical antipsychotic with mixed dopamine and serotonin antagonism, and that the subject described by dos Santos and Strassman did not become psychotic after taking neither D2 agonists (cocaine, amphetamines) nor cannabis, but only after using serotoninergic compounds that act as 5-HT2A agonists [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. This is also in accordance with studies in which 5-HT2A antagonists reduced the effects of classic/serotonergic hallucinogens, including ayahuasca [Vollenweider et al. 1998; Kometer et al. 2013; Valle et al. 2016] However, the subject described by dos Santos and Strassman also described an extensive experience with other hallucinogens that act as 5-HT2A agonists (such as LSD and psilocybin) without psychotic incidents, and the last episode was apparently induced by excessive alcohol intake [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. It is not clear why these psychotic reactions occurred only with 2C-I, MDMA, and alcohol, but it is possible that after several psychotic episodes the subject may have developed an increased sensibility to psychotic symptoms that generalized to nonserotonergic drugs, or that the dose, intensity, or frequency of use of the other drugs was not sufficient to induce full-blown psychotic symptoms. Indeed, several of the cases reviewed described that the subjects had used several doses of ayahuasca/DMT before the psychotic episode, suggesting a possible dose-related or cumulative effect. The hallucinogenic effects of ayahuasca do not seem to be mediated by harmine and related β-carboline alkaloids (THH and harmaline), since human studies about their possible psychoactive properties are inconclusive, with reports describing hallucinogenic effects [Shulgin and Shulgin, 1997; Naranjo, 1959; Pennes and Hoch, 1957], sedative-like effects [Ott, 1994, 1999], or lack of psychoactive effects [Slotkin et al. 1970]. However, a recent study suggested that the β-carbolines in ayahuasca could have specific effects in the human electroencephalogram (EEG), suggesting central/psychoactive effects [Schenberg et al. 2015]. Moreover, compounds such as harmine may have pro-dopaminergic effects [Nunes et al. 2016], and the possible role of these compounds in the psychotic effects of ayahuasca is not currently known. Thus, more studies are needed to better understand the effects of the β-carboline alkaloids in humans. It is unknown if there are people vulnerable to hallucinogenic drugs, but in the two cases that we had direct contact subjects had no personal or familiar history of psychological problems, and were subjects perfectly adapted and with high qualified works and high educational levels. One of these subjects had a long history of ayahuasca use without having suffered any psychological side effect. Since he used cannabis and ayahuasca at the same time, it is possible cannabis could have potentiated the psychotic effects of DMT. In our field observations over the last 10–15 years, we have observed precisely this phenomenon [dos Santos, 2011]. Also, those two subjects suffered the psychotic crisis under the course of a structured ritual, and the UDV case series reported cases that occurred in this structured religious context. Thus, although the ritual may have some protective effect, it is not a total guarantee of complete safety [Lima, 1996–97; Lima and Tófoli, 2011]. Considering the good and fast response of those two subjects to antipsychotic medication, it could be possible that ayahuasca/DMT do not trigger a latent psychotic response in healthy individuals, but just induce a transitory psychotic crisis. But in people with a history of mental disorders, as was the case of some of the reports described in the present review, these substances could aggravate the premorbid condition. Therefore, although the psychological content of an ayahuasca experience can be sometimes difficult to face, it does not explain by itself a psychotic reaction. It is more probable that psychological side effects will appear in the form of transitory anxiety that disappears when the effects of ayahuasca fade away. But there may be conditions where the biochemical reactions induced by hallucinogens over 5-HT2A receptors induce a psychotic state that lasts more than the pharmacological effect of the drug, being necessary to rebalance the system/brain with a pharmacological/antipsychotic intervention that it is not dependent on the psychological content. Ayahuasca guides should be cautious in selecting people before giving them ayahuasca. Since ayahuasca use is being popularized internationally [Labate and Feeney, 2012], future studies should explore deeply the prevalence and incidence of psychiatric reactions in ayahuasca communities.","It is estimated that nearly 20 000 people worldwide are members of some of the Brazilian ayahuasca religions (Santo Daime, UDV, Barquinha) [Labate et al. 2009]. The scientific literature suggests that acute ayahuasca administration to healthy volunteers has a good safety profile, and that long-term ritual ayahuasca consumption is not associated with cognitive or psychiatric problems [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. The psychotic episodes described in the present systematic review are apparently associated with several contributing factors, and not only ayahuasca or DMT intake. Many cases involved individuals with a personal or family history of psychosis or nonpsychotic bipolar disorder, or concomitant use of other drugs. Therefore, these individuals have a different profile from those that participate in controlled studies where a psychiatric screening is performed and use of other drugs is not allowed. Moreover, in controlled studies, only single or few ayahuasca/DMT doses are administered, and in some cases described, related to DMT use, the subjects have used several doses DMT before their psychotic episode Previous reviews of adverse effects of hallucinogens in noncontrolled/recreational settings demonstrated that in reports ‘from the field’ it is very difficult to tease apart preexisting psychopathology, drug/alcohol abuse, family history, and other important features such as proper preparation, guidance, and integration of drug effects. Thus, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship with hallucinogen use and most of these cases [Klock et al. 1974; Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2014; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. In the case reports described in the present review, it is similarly difficult to determine the significance of ayahuasca/DMT use in such complicated settings, especially considering the safety record of ayahuasca/DMT administration in controlled clinical trials where rigorous screening, supervision, and follow up are provided Taken together, these results suggest that the incidence of psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca/DMT intake is a rare phenomenon, and these rare instances appear be associated with previous premorbid characteristics of the individuals, previous and possibly concurrent drug abuse, and lack of a supervised setting. Therefore, considering the possible influence of these and other factors, the causal relation between ayahuasca/DMT and these cases is not always clear. These data suggest that performance of a psychiatric and drug use history before ayahuasca or DMT administration in controlled settings may reduce the occurrence of psychotic experiences. Regarding noncontrolled/recreational use, individuals with personal or family history of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders, psychotic depression or mania, or with ongoing manic or psychotic symptomatology, should avoid ayahuasca/DMT intake"
48,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.10.026,"We have conducted a systematic review to examine the acute and long-term effects of serotonergic hallucinogens in humans using neuroimaging methods. Neurochemical imaging studies [PET and SPECT] involving acute oral administration of mescaline, psilocybin, and ayahuasca suggest that these drugs induce excitatory effects in frontolateral/frontomedial cortex, medial temporal lobe, and amygdala – regions involved in self-awareness, cognitive functioning, memory and emotion processing. These results were consistent across studies. Furthermore, these studies were performed in separated laboratories and used different drugs and neuroimaging technics. Studies using fMRI and involving acute oral [ayahuasca] or intravenous [DMT, psilocybin, LSD] administration of serotonergic hallucinogens showed less consistent results. Most resting-state fMRI studies showed significant reductions in brain activation in the same regions where neurochemical imaging studies showed increased activation, as well as in other regions such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, and visual areas (Daumann et al., 2010, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015) According to Carhart-Harris et al. (2012a), the inconsistence between PET/SPECT and fMRI results could be related to the time-scales considered in the different techniques. Thus, the radiotracers used to measure blood perfusion/glucose metabolism have long half-lives [e.g., the radiotracer 18F FDG, used to measure glucose metabolism, has a half-life of 110 min], using much greater time-scales than fMRI measures. Therefore, phasic or short-term effects of psilocybin could show some compensating/rebound effect that is detected by PET or SPECT (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a) However, nonsignificant (Daumann et al., 2008, Speth et al., 2016), mixed (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014), and opposite (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) results were also reported in fMRI studies. Moreover, an active-task fMRI study reported significant increases in memory-related activations in the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, mid-cingulate cortex, pre-sensorimotor area, precuneus, subgenual cingulate cortex, temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, and visual and other sensory cortical areas after intravenous psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b), and another fMRI study using an imagery task showed that oral ayahuasca induced a significant activation in the primary visual area comparable to the activation levels of a natural image with the eyes open, and ayahuasca also activated the cuneus and lingual gyrus and parahippocampal, retrosplenial, and frontopolar cortices (de Araujo et al., 2012). Also, an fMRI study reported that oral psilocybin significantly attenuated right amygdala activation to both negative and neutral pictures and that this effect was significantly correlated with increases in positive mood (Kraehenmann et al., 2015a) Interpretation of functional connectivity results is even more difficult. Functional connectivity alterations in key hubs of the DMN were observed in several studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016, Lebedev et al., 2015, Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015, Kaelen et al., 2016), which partially corroborates the neuroanatomical substrates where PET/SPECT studies found alterations in blood perfusion/glucose metabolism. Moreover, functional connectivity studies reported increased coupling between cortical networks, suggesting an increased integration between cortical regions (de Araujo et al., 2012, Petri et al., 2014, Roseman et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Kaelen et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Furthermore, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex (Kraehenmann et al., 2015b), and the interaction between music and LSD increased parahippocampal cortex/visual cortex functional connectivity and parahippocampal cortex to visual cortex information flow (Kaelen et al., 2016) Regarding structural MRI studies, one study with regular ayahuasca users reported significant cortical thinning in mesotemporal and inferior frontal gyri, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior occipital gyrus; and increased thickening in precentral gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex (Bouso et al., 2015). Importantly, there was no evidence of increased psychopathology in the ayahuasca group, suggesting that the structural alterations were not associated with psychopathologies. Moreover, inverse correlations were found between changes in cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate cortex and age of onset of ayahuasca use, intensity of prior ayahuasca use, and “self-transcendence”/spirituality Another structural MRI study investigated SERT and 5-HT2A receptor binding in polydrug, hallucinogen-preferring users and found no effects regarding SERT values and a slight reduction on 5-HT2A receptor densities (Erritzoe et al., 2011). However, significant effects on 5-HT2A receptor densities were observed only when both group of MDMA/hallucinogens users were analyzed together, suggesting that part of this effect might be more related to MDMA than to serotonergic hallucinogens (Mueller et al., 2016). Moreover, regional decreases in neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding were of only 9% in the neocortex, and when two controls with very high 5-HT2A receptor binding values were excluded from the sample the difference between groups was no longer significant The reviewed human data is corroborated by several preclinical studies showing that administration of serotonergic hallucinogens induce genetic, neurochemical, and behavioral alterations in/associated with brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus [see for review Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Nichols, 2016]. A recent study in rats reported that acute ayahuasca administration was associated with decreased concentrations of glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA] in the amygdala, increased GABA levels in the hippocampus, and an increased utilization rate of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin in the amygdala (de Castro-Neto et al., 2013). In another recent study, prolonged [30 days] ayahuasca administration to rats interfered with emotional memory, a process involving the hippocampus and the amygdala (Favaro et al., 2015), and Pic-Taylor et al. (2015) administered ayahuasca to rats to investigate patterns of neuronal activation using c-fos marked neurons and found higher neuronal activation in the dorsal raphe nuclei, amygdaloid nucleus, and hippocampal formation after ayahuasca administration. A recent study showed that acute administration of psilocin [the active metabolite of psilocybin] significantly increased MRI signal in the rat hypothalamus, olfactory regions, amygdala, and other limbic regions, and also increased cerebral blood flow in the somatosensory cortex after sensorial stimuli. However, MRI signal decreases were observed in the cingulate, motor, and somatosensory cortices [among other regions], and the amplitude of neuronal responses [local field potentials] to sensory stimuli in the somatosensory cortex was also decreased, suggesting an altered relationship between evoked neuronal and haemodynamic response magnitudes (Spain et al., 2015) The results by Spain et al. (2015) are corroborated by a recent study in humans showing that psilocybin induced significant increases on BOLD signal variance and total spectral power in the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral hippocampi, while significant decreases were observed in local field potentials in the DMN, executive control, and dorsal attention networks (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014). Their study by Spain et al. (2015) could help to explain, at least in part, the discrepancy between PET/SPECT findings of increased blood perfusion/glucose metabolism and fMRI results showing decreased cerebral blood flow. Moreover, neurophysiological studies in humans using electroencephalography [EEG] and MEG consistently show that serotonergic hallucinogens decrease the power of lower frequency oscillations [theta/alpha frequency range, <20 Hz], especially alpha oscillations [8–12 Hz], in key regions of the DMN such as the anterior/posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal region, which induces an excitatory effect (Riba et al., 2002, Riba et al., 2004, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Kometer et al., 2015, Valle et al., 2016) Although the neural effects of serotonergic hallucinogens may involve serotonergic [e.g., 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors] and non-serotonergic [e.g., dopaminergic and sigma receptors] neurotransmission, the agonist effect of these drugs on deep-layer pyramidal neurons rich in 5-HT2A receptors seem to be the main mechanism of action of these compounds (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Hintzen and Passie, 2010, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, Kometer et al., 2012, Kometer et al., 2013, Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Baumeister et al., 2014, Tylš et al., 2014, Halberstadt, 2015, Nichols, 2016, Valle et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Agonism at these receptors expressed in frontal and medial cortical areas produce altered synchronization of cortical activity (Riba et al., 2002, Riba et al., 2004, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Petri et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Valle et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), “disintegration” of network connectivity (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Lebedev et al., 2015, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), increased excitability of multimodal association hubs (Riba et al., 2004, Riba et al., 2006, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), and altered information flow (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Alonso et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Kaelen et al., 2016). These effects create a state of “expanded awareness”, “ego-dissolution”, and “unconstrained cognition” (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Petri et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016, Gallimore, 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Lebedev et al., 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016) Agonism at frontocortical 5-HT2A receptors also modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission and may increase the expression of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor [GDNF], thus enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis by increasing the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons (González-Maeso et al., 2008, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, Moreno et al., 2011, Moreno et al., 2013, Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Baumeister et al., 2014, Carbonaro et al., 2015, Halberstadt, 2015, Nichols, 2016) Interestingly, these effects seem to be the neural basis involved in the therapeutic potentials of these compounds. Preclinical and human research suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties (dos Santos et al., 2016a, dos Santos et al., 2016b, Nunes et al., 2016). Indeed, acute administration of DMT (Gillin, 1976, Strassman et al., 1994, Riba et al., 2015), psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, Studerus et al., 2011, Kometer et al., 2012, Kraehenmann et al., 2015a), LSD (Schmid et al., 2015), and ayahuasca (Osório et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016) is associated with increases in positive mood. Furthermore, the studies reviewed show that serotonergic hallucinogens decrease DMN activity, which is increased during rumination, an important depressive symptom. Together with decreases in amygdala activity (Kraehenmann et al., 2015a, Kraehenmann et al., 2015b), reduced DMN activity may be another possible mechanism involved in the antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of these drugs. Moreover, observational studies also suggest that psilocybin, LSD, and ayahuasca may have therapeutic potentials (Krebs and Johansen, 2013, Hendricks et al., 2014, Hendricks et al., 2015, Johansen and Krebs, 2015, dos Santos et al., 2016a, dos Santos et al., 2016b, Nunes et al., 2016) Psychological mechanisms also play a role in the therapeutic properties of these drugs, and appear to be related to neuroimaging findings. For instance, in the retrospective MRI study of long-term ayahuasca users, the ayahuasca group not only scored higher than controls in “self-transcendence”, but scores were negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate cortex (Bouso et al., 2015) “Self-transcendence” is a character dimension related to religiousness and spirituality, and the beneficial effects of serotonergic hallucinogens appear to be related to their ability to elicit religious/mystical experiences (Kurland et al., 1971, McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971, Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981, Grof, 2001, Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, Hintzen and Passie, 2010, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, MacLean et al., 2011, Krebs and Johansen, 2012, Baumeister et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, Majić et al., 2015). Indeed, psilocybin induced religious-like experiences in healthy volunteers, with sustained improvements in attitudes, mood, and personality (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, MacLean et al., 2011), and psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience, together with the overall intensity of the experience, were correlated with improvements in tobacco (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014, Johnson et al., 2014) and alcohol (Bogenschutz et al., 2015) dependence. Moreover, the religious-like effects of LSD were associated with sustained improvements in patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases (Gasser et al., 2014, Gasser et al., 2015). Interestingly, decreased DMN activity and decreased DMN-TPN inverse coupling were observed not only after administration of serotonergic hallucinogens, but also in meditation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, de Araujo et al., 2012) Taken together, the neuroimaging data reviewed suggests that serotonergic hallucinogens produce their effects by modulating brain areas associated with perception and emotion processing, executive functions, and other complex cognitive functions. Specifically, these group of compounds may induce acute increases in blood perfusion/glucose metabolism in prefrontal and limbic areas involved in the regulation of mood, interoception, cognition, and consciousness; decreases in reactivity of brain structures related to anxiety/fear processing such as the amygdala; and reduced brain activity in key regions of the DMN, involved in mind-wandering and self-awareness. Somehow, the altered state of consciousness produced by serotonergic hallucinogens appears to create a disruption of repetitive, rigid, and pathological patterns of negative thoughts and emotions, commonly observed in anxiety and mood disorders and in drug dependence, and this effect may be therapeutically relevant. Finally, long-term use of these drugs was also associated with cortical thickness alterations in important areas of the DMN, such as the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices A main limitation of the present systematic review is the inclusion of studies with small sample sizes, high degree of heterogeneity, and without placebo or control groups. Other important limitations include the variety of doses of the same compound used in different studies and the difficulty in accurately measuring drug dose/composition in retrospective studies However, despite these important limitations, the reviewed results suggest that the neural basis of the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens involve an agonist action of these drugs on 5-HT2A receptors expressed in deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the fronto-parieto-occipito-temporal cortex, involved in perception, memory, and emotion processing, cognitive functions, regulation of neurotrophic factors, and consciousness. Moreover, although the mechanisms of action responsible for the effects produced by serotonergic hallucinogens are not completely understood, the available evidence suggest that these drugs may not only improve our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, consciousness, and other complex topics, but may also have therapeutic uses in treatment-resistant patients with anxiety and mood disorders or drug dependence. Further development of neuroimaging techniques, better sample and drug delivery standardizations and the integration of data across neuroimaging modalities may extend progress in this important field",
49,10.1177/0269881116679368,"We have collated and summarized the pre-prohibition literature on the use of psychedelics  in the treatment of broadly defined UMD in Table 1. 22 studies published between 1949 and  1973 were included. LSD was, by far, the most commonly used psychedelic. Mescaline was  occasionally used. The absence of psilocybin is discussed below. The sample size ranged from  5 to 77, with a total aggregated sample size of 423 across all the studies where this was clearly  defined.  The  number  of  psychedelic  sessions  ranged  from  1  to  58 and  the  therapeutic paradigms applied were variable. The dose of LSD used ranged from 20 micrograms to 1,500  micrograms. Mescaline  was  used  at  doses  of  200-400mg, in  combination  with  LSD. Many  studies used titrated dosing schedules that took account of individual patient responses to  the drug. Savage(Savage,  Fadiman,  Mogar  and  Allen,  1966b),  in  1966,  neatly  summarized the  methodological difficulties of these pre-prohibition papers. “Nearly  all  studies  have  serious  shortcomings…namely,  1)  anecdotal  evidence;  2)  inadequate  assessment  procedures;  3)  insufficient  follow  up;  4)  naïve  statistical  treatment; 5) lack of controls.”. We agree with these criticisms, noting also that a meta-analytical approach to the reported  studies is  impossible  as  continuous  outcome measures  were  only  collected  by  1  research  group. Only 4 studies have any mention of a control group(Savage, 1952; Savage et al., 1973;  B Sloane and Lovett Doust, 1954; Whitaker, 1964) and in only one(Savage et al., 1973) could  the  control  group  be  deemed  to  be  A)  adequately  selected  and  B)  adequately  described.  Outcomes  measures  were  generally  so  vague  that  the  only  meaningful  grouping  was  a  dichotomous variable reflecting those who were felt by their clinicians to have ‘improved’, as  opposed to those that didn’t. Given the heterogeneity in definition, ‘improvement’ cannot be  further defined. Clearly this is subject to bias and is neither systematic nor objective. In those  studies  where  the  number  of  patients  who  were  deemed  to  have  improved  was  actually  specified (19  out  of  22),  335  (79.2%) out of 423 patients  were  judged  to  have  improved,  ranging in the various studies from 40% to 95%. Studies using higher doses of psychedelics  and/or combining psychedelics with psychotherapy or psychological support appear to show  better results. In  an  attempt  to  delineate  more  classical  depressive disorders  from  the  wider  clinical  definitions  of  ‘anxiety’  and  ‘neurotic’  disorders  subsumed  within  our  analysis,  we  also  repeated  this analysis  restricted  to  cases  classified as ‘depressives,’ ‘depressive  reactions,’  and ‘depressive neuroses’, where this was specified. Of the papers where there was sufficient  information  to  do  this  (11  out  of  a  total  of  21  papers)  improvement  was  seen  in  73.7%  (101/137). Further restricting the sample to purely ‘depressives’ and ‘depressive reactions’,  improvement was seen in 72.5% (58/80). Data on those who were felt to have worsened with  treatment was  either  incomplete,  or  not  included  at  all.  The  degree  of  improvement  is  notable even if the presumption must be that it is biased in favour of a therapeutic effect.  The research deserves repetition in a modern, controlled context. In response to the Thalidomide tragedy, the US introduced the Kefauver-Harris Drug Efficacy  Amendments in 1962, which required well controlled trials to evidence a drug’s efficacy and  safety  before  it  could  be  marketed(Peltzman,  1973).  These changes heralded  modern  paradigms of trial design, which rely on randomisation of individuals to a placebo or active  treatment, and blinding of both assessor and participants to the intervention. This is thought  to partially compensate for selection, performance and detection bias and serves to isolate the effect of the drug from the confounds of its surroundings. However, there are inherent  difficulties with such designs when psychotropic drugs are being used, and particularly with  psychedelics(Oram, 2012), for four reasons. Firstly, blinding is largely impossible. Therapeutic doses of psychedelics induce subjective and  objective changes in feeling, thinking and behaviour that are usually obvious both to recipient  and observer. Secondly, and on this basis, placebo control is problematic because the absence  of the psychedelic effect is also obvious. Thirdly, and perhaps most pertinently to psychedelic  trials, the ‘set’  (psychological state) and ‘setting’  (interpersonal and physical environment) within  which  the  drug  is  experienced  are  inextricably  linked  to  the  therapeutic  effect(Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1997). Attempting to isolate the drug from these variables, as  modern trials attempt to do, will miss the widely accepted point that the therapeutic effect  is  subsumed  within,  and  inextricable  from,  the  interaction  between  psychedelic,  set  and  setting. Finally, and a point common to trials in mood disorders in general, the diagnostic and  aetiological heterogeneity in patients diagnosed with UMD is famously wide. Some patients  have broadly adaptive personalities with particular sensitivities to certain stressors. Others  have  chronic  and  enduring  patterns  of  learned  helplessness or  other  personality  factors.  Others may have biologically mediated mood problems derived from subclinical imbalances  in  immune  or endocrine  function. Most  will  have  a variable mixture  of  these  factors  contributing to the clinical picture. Consequently, routine clinical treatments for UMDs are  also  variable, requiring a flexibility  in  clinical  approach  that  modern  trial  designs  are  particularly designed to avoid. Active  placebos  have  been  used to attempt  to compensate  for difficulties in  blinding  and  placebo  control.  In  a  randomized,  double  blind  trial  using  psilocybin in  psychedelic-naïve  volunteers over two or three sessionsto investigate mystical experiences, clinicians were told  that participants would receive at least one dose of psilocybin, but that at other sessions a  variety of other drugs might be administered(Griffiths et al., 2006). They were then asked to  guess  the  drugs  used  immediately  after  each  session.  In  fact,  only  psilocybin  or  methylphenidate  were  used  in  the  trial.  23%  of  sessions  were  misclassified  (that  is,  the  clinician  either  thought  a  methylphenidate session  was a psilocybin session or that  a psilocybin session was  something  other  than  psilocybin).  However when  clinicians  did misclassify a  session  they  tended  to misclassify a methylphenidate  session as a  psilocybin  session. Furthermore, when psilocybin was given but the clinician did not accurately guess  this, most participants still reported deeply meaningful, mystical experiences. This suggests  that  the  occurrence  of  a  mystical experience  is  not  likely  to  be  an  artefact simply  of  expectation or suggestion(Griffiths et al., 2006), and may suggest that the double blind, active  placebo condition is a more favourable trial design. Randomisation between low and high  doses of psychedelic is also a credible design strategy given the difficulties described, a design that was  partially implemented in  a  study  in  1973  by  Savage  et  al.  included  in  this  review(Savage et al., 1973). This showed statistically significant superiority of LSD at a dose  of  350  micrograms when  compared  to conventional  treatment  over  a  wide  range  of  psychological  test  variables  in  a  sample  of  96  patients  with  ‘severe  chronic  neuroses’ randomized to low dose LSD, high dose LSD and treatment as usual. Correction for multiple  statistical comparisons was not performed. Attempts to standardize the context, or setting, of the psychedelic experience are possible in  controlled trials, but the number of variables implied by this and the pragmatics of controlling  them, suggests that a significant degree of variation is unavoidable. Whilst the dose of drug  and basic environmental context (the layout of the room, decoration, sound and ambience,  for example) can be largely controlled in medical research settings, the psychotherapy itself  must inevitably  be  flexible. Defined  training  programs in  psychedelic  research  and  psychotherapy  are  now  being  set  up  to  provide  some structure  for  this,  such  as  the new  ‘Certificate in Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapies & Research’ in California, which took its  inaugural intake of students in 2015(Denenmark, 2015). However, a raft of questions remain  to be answered. In the pre-prohibition literature, distinction was made between ‘psycholytic’  therapy, which used low doses of psychedelics to facilitate access to unconscious material,  and  ‘psychedelic’  therapy,  which  used  high  doses  to  elicit  therapeutic  mystical/spiritual  experiences. There is some evidence that mystical experiences with psilocybin are associated  with  increased  well-being  and  personal  meaning  over  a  year  later(Griffiths  et  al.,  2008),  however it is not known whether one paradigm is generally superior to the other, or whether  there is variation in response according to disorder and paradigm used.Carefully  designed  clinical  trials  that  incorporate  biological  mechanism  studies  may  help  resolve some questions. For example, the dichotomy between the more verbal ‘psycholytic’ paradigm and the largely ineffable ‘psychedelic’ paradigm raises the question of whether they reflect a common continuum of response to psychedelics, or distinct entities in themselves. Modern neurobiology and neuroimaging studies may help answer this question, and ideally  such appraisals of mechanism will need to be embedded within clinical efficacy trials. If the  two paradigms appear mechanistically distinct in terms of neurobiology, it may suggest that  the  two  paradigms  will  have  different  therapeutic  efficacies  in  different  disorders  and,  perhaps, different personality  types. However,  there should be  robust ethical scrutiny and  oversight  of  trial  designs  that  expose  clinical  trial  participants,  who  by  definition  will  be  psychiatrically  unwell,  to  the  emotional  difficulties  implicit  in  brain  scanning  and  blood  sampling. Hitherto, neuroimaging studies using psychedelics have been restricted to healthy  volunteers. In summary, it appears that a particularly careful and well-considered balance between the  needs  of  the  participants  and  the  needs  of  the  trial  will  be  required in  studies  using  psychedelics. Funders and research ethics committees will need to understand the inherent  difficulties  discussed  above  if  they  are  to scrutinize trial  designs  using  psychedelics successfully,  and  trial  designers  will  need,  similarly,  to  be  detailed  and  explicit  about  the  environmental and  psychotherapeutic milieu  in which a  study is  to  be performed.  Clinical  trials using psychedelics will need to be sufficiently methodologically detailed at the point of  publication to allow genuine replication. Scientific mechanism studies will need, ideally, to be  pursued  alongside  clinical  trials if  this  is  pragmatic  and  ethical. Within  this multi-pronged  approach to evidence gathering, and a sufficient degree of definition, replicable results and  common threads of insight into the nature and applicability of psychedelics to medicine in  general, and to psychiatry in particular, should emerge with time. Psilocybin  was  marketed  under  the  trade  name  ‘Indocybin’ by  the  same  pharmaceutical  company  that  marketed  LSD  (Sandoz).  Whilst  it  was  used  in  individual  patients,  this  systematic review did not find any clinical trials of its pre-prohibition use in broadly defined  mood disorder. This is likely to be because psilocybin (and its active metabolite, psilocin) were  not isolated until 1959, and the drug marketed after this(Hofmann et al., 1959). By this time, LSD research was well underway and it is likely that most clinicians would have wanted to  stick  to  what  was  an  established  pharmaceutical  entity,  rather  than  risk  the  potential  complications of trying a new one. With this in mind, it is notable that psilocybin has been  favoured over LSD in modern clinical trials. There are several possible reasons for this. Firstly,  psilocybin  has  a shorter  duration  of  action than  LSD  or  mescaline,  which  makes  day-case  treatment sessions feasible, without the need for supervised (and costly) overnight hospital stays. Secondly, anecdotal evidence from recreational users suggests that psilocybin is less  liable  to  occasion  highly  distressing  psychological  reactions (although  this  may simply  be  because psilocybin is easier to measure than LSD). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, LSD remains a particularly stigmatized drug. Not only is this likely to colour individual experiences  of the drug effect, but it is also likely that this stigma still negatively affects the chances of  successful applications to grant funders and research ethics committees. These observations lead naturally to a discussion about the risks of using psychedelic drugs in  medical  and  recreational  settings. Physiologically, psychedelics (particularly  LSD  and  psilocybin) are notably safe. LSD and psilocybin have a toxicity ratio (estimated lethal dose as  a ratio of the estimated therapeutic dose) of one thousand or more (alcohol, by comparison,  has a toxicity ratio of about 10, cocaine about 15, ketamine about 38 and fluoxetine about  100)(Gable, 2004).  The risk of harm from recreational use of psychedelics should not be conflated with the risk  of harm from medical use. Turning to recreational use first. In 2010, an analysis of harms to  the end-user and society caused by a range of recreationally used psychoactive substances  ranked LSD and psilocybin amongst the safest of all those studied(Nutt et al., 2010), however  the precipitation of psychotic disorders by psychedelics remains a concern. Carhart-Harris et  al,  in  a  web-based  self-report  questionnaire  of  recreational  use  of  psychedelics,  noted  prolonged psychotic reactions were reported by 1.3% (six of 463) of LSD users and 1.6% (eight  of  503)  of  psilocybin  users  in  their  sample(Carhart-Harris  and  Nutt,  2010).  Howevr,  this  proportion included those reporting derealisation, which is generally classified as an anxiety  derived phenomenon rather than a psychotic phenomenon. Despite this, the prevalence is  not  significantly  greater  than  might  be  expected  in  the  general  population.  Three  large  population studies have found that use of psychedelics is associated with a lower relative risk of  suicide(Hendricks  et  al.,  2015),  need  for  psychiatric  medication  and  psychological  distress(Johansen  and  Krebs,  2015),  and  recidivism(Hendricks  et  al.,  2014).  Despite the  authors  attempting  to  correct  for  socio-demographic  variables  in  these  studies,  it  is  still  possible that these results are confounded by users of psychedelics tending not to be from  such  socially  disadvantaged  groups  when  compared  to  users  of  other  recreationally  used  substances. Very rare, reports of recreational users committing apparent acts of suicide whilst  under  the influence  of  psychedelics  do exist, and are  unfortunately emphasized  by media  outlets(Keeler and Reifler, 1967; Reynolds and Jindrich, 1985). Turning  to  harm  in medical  settings, Cohen noted  a  single case  of  prolonged  (>48  hours)  psychosis in a survey of 1,200 research participants given psychedelics, and this case turned  out to have an identical twin suffering with schizophrenia(Cohen, 1960). Savage et al. in 1973  noted that of ‘the nearly 500 diverse patients treated [with LSD]’ only 2 cases of psychosis  were noted. This first was in a 21-year-old patient with ‘severe chronic neurosis’ treated with  350  micrograms of  LSD.  This  patient  had a  history  of  psychotic  episodes in  the  past, and  recovered with psychotherapy and antipsychotic medication. The second case was a ‘schizoid  subject’  with  a  history  of  alcoholism,  but  no  further  details  were  given  about  the  case. According  to  recent guidelines(M  Johnson et al.,  2008), the  first  two of  these participants would have been excluded from participation in modern trials, whilst it is impossible to tell  whether the third would or would not have. In the most comprehensive review of specific adverse reactions to psychedelics in medical and  recreational settings,  Strassman(Strassman,  1984) pointed  out  that  researcher’s  and  clinician’s attitudes to psychedelics appeared to result in considerable variation in judgement  about what was, and was not, considered a risk or an adverse event “It  is  important  to  use  caution  in  discussing  the  concept  of  adverse  reactions  to  psychedelic drugs. At one extreme are those who believe that the drug-induced state  itself is either primarily a pathological one, i.e. a ""model psychosis"", or that the desire  to induce such a state is a function of pre-existing personality dysfunction. At the other  extreme is the view that even the most disorganized,  frightened, dysfunctional, and  regressed  reactions  to  psychedelic  drugs  are  necessary/healthy  reactions  seen  in throwing  off  ""straight""  society’s  ""shackles""  and  in  reaching  a  ""higher""  level  of  consciousness. The description and/or reporting of adverse reactions to psychedelics  is, therefore, subject to some degree of investigators’ perspective on the use of these  drugs.” As a natural extension of this, Strassman also points out, about LSD: “One of the most confounding aspects of almost all studies of either acute or chronic  effects  of  LSD  is  their  lack  of  pre-LSD  data.  The  role  of  LSD  in  producing  ""LSD  psychoses,"" brain damage, long-lasting personality change, and flashbacks is difficult,  if not impossible to discern without pre-LSD values for the dependent variables” His conclusions about the adverse effects of LSD are summed up in the following paragraph: “With  the  available  data,  it  appears  that  the  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  to  psychedelic drugs is low when individuals, both normal volunteers and patients, are  carefully  screened  and  prepared,  supervised  and  followed  up,  and  given  judicious  doses  of  pharmaceutical  quality  drug.  The  few  prospective  studies  noting  adverse  reactions have fairly consistently described characteristics predicting poor response to  these drugs. The majority of studies of adverse reactions, retrospective in nature, have  described a constellation of premorbid characteristics in individuals seeking treatment  for  these  reactions  where  drugs  of  unknown  purity  were  taken  in  unsupervised  settings.” Whilst  such  research  certainly  deserves  repetition  (particularly  because  modern  research  with psychedelics is tending to use psilocybin) a summation of the evidence suggests that the  risks associated with medically controlled and supervised use of psychedelics are low and that  evidence-based  guidelines(M  Johnson  et  al.,  2008) improve  safety  even  further. In  this  context it is also notable that far more dangerous substances, such as opiates, are routinely  used in medical therapy even though recreational use is also widespread, and certainly much  more dangerous than recreational use of psychedelics. No deaths have been unambiguously  linked to the physiological toxicity of classical serotonergic psychedelics whereas in 2014, in the  US  alone,  10,574 people died  of street  heroin  overdoses,  and  a  further  18,893  from  prescription opiate overdoses(National Center for Health Statistics, 2015).  A single pilot study of psilocybin in the treatment of resistant major depressive disorder was  recently  completed  in  the United  Kingdom(Carhart-Harris,  Bolstridge,  et  al.,  2016).  In this  open-label  feasibility  trial,  12  patients with  treatment-resistant  unipolar major  depression  received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart, in a supportive setting,  with psychological  support and medical  supervision before, during and after each  session.  Follow up was from 1 week to 3 months post treatment. 8 of 12 patients achieved complete remission  of  symptoms  at  1  week  and  7  patients  (58%)  continued  to  meet  criteria  for  response (50% reduction in BDI score relative to baseline) at 3 months, with 5 of these still in  complete remission. The therapy was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. The  American  psychologist  and  LSD  researcher,  Betty  Eisner,  summarised  the  psychotherapeutic  mechanism  by  which  LSD,  and  by  implication  other  psychedelics,  may  work as follows(Eisner and Cohen, 1958): 1) LSD lessens defensiveness 2) There is a heightened capacity to relive early experiences with accompanying release  of feelings 3) Therapist-patient relationships are enhanced 4) There is an increased appearance of unconscious material. If the aetiology of UMD in some patients can be understood, at least in part, as the present  day emotional and behavioural sequelae of unresolved traumas and emotional conflicts from  the  past, with anxieties about  the  future,  it  is  reasonable  to hypothesize that  psychedelic  psychotherapy will catalyse the resolution of such conflicts in a proportion of patients where  other treatment modalities have failed. There is a pressing economic need for such interventions. Unipolar depressive disorder costs  the  United  States  alone  over  $210  billion  annually(Greenberg  et  al.,  2015).  Response  to  treatment is often suboptimal and entrenched, maladaptive patterns of thought, feeling and  behaviour are the hallmark of resistance to treatment. Whilst long, detailed forms of dynamic, analytical and behavioural psychotherapy may change such patterns over the course of years they  are  expensive  and  time  consuming.  Psychedelic  therapy  may represent a  form  of  catalysed psychotherapy  whereby  the  drug  acts  to  hasten the  breakdown of  habitual maladaptive templates of  thinking and behaviour in  supportive  therapeutic environments.  The evidence from the pre-prohibition literature, whilst unsystematic and methodologically  suboptimal, suggests that this is worth re-investigating. Furthermore, a recent pilot study in  treatment resistant depressive disorder has shown encouraging results. Taken together, the  evidence  suggests  that  there  is  a strong  medical  and  economic  argument  for the  further  investigation  of  psychedelics  in  the  treatment  of  unipolar  mood  disorders  in  sensitively  designed, modern clinical trials",
50,10.1056/NEJMoa2032994,"In this 6-week randomized trial comparing psilocybin with escitalopram in patients with long-standing, mild-to-severe depression, the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6 (the primary outcome) did not differ significantly between the trial groups. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram; however, the confidence intervals for the between-group differences were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and no conclusions can be drawn from these data. In both trial groups, the scores on the depression scales at week 6 were numerically lower than the baseline scores, but the absence of a placebo group in the trial limits conclusions about the effect of either agent alone. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups, and no serious adverse events occurred. The percentages of patients who had anxiety, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, or reduced emotional responsiveness were higher in the escitalopram group than in the psilocybin group.19 Four patients in the escitalopram group stopped taking their daily capsules entirely, and 1 patient halved the dose because of perceived adverse events. No patient in the psilocybin group requested to cancel the second psilocybin dose. Three patients were unable to attend sessions to receive the second psilocybin dose owing to the Covid-19 lockdown (2 patients in the psilocybin group and 1 in the escitalopram group). The most common adverse event in the psilocybin group was transient headache reported within 24 hours after the day of psilocybin dosing. The incidence of headache was similar to those reported in previous studies of psilocybin Acute subjective effects of psilocybin relating to the psychedelic experience were not included as adverse events in our trial, because previous studies have suggested that they may have a mediating influence on positive outcomes.21 The altered quality of conscious experience typically induced by a 25-mg dose of psilocybin adds complexity to this treatment model, because it requires that psychological support be provided to patients during and after treatment sessions.15 This requirement informed this trial’s screening criteria that excluded patients with preexisting psychiatric conditions believed to be incompatible with the limited psychological support that could be made available within the trial. This exclusion criterion may have biased the trial sample toward patients who could receive psilocybin without unacceptable side effects. However, psychological support was provided for both groups in this trial, and it is possible that the adjunctive psychological support improved outcomes among those in the escitalopram group A limitation of the trial is the brief duration of escitalopram treatment, because this drug has a delayed therapeutic action on depression.22 Had the course of escitalopram been extended, it is possible that better efficacy would have been observed among the patients in the escitalopram group. Patients who received the 25-mg dose of psilocybin rated the intensity of acute subjective effects higher than patients who received the 1-mg dose (Fig. S7). We did not assess the effectiveness of blinding within each treatment group. It was assumed that the active comparator design would mitigate expectancy bias, but we cannot be confident that guessing of the trial-group assignment or biased expectations in favor of psilocybin did not influence the results. Although efforts were made to recruit patients by external referrals, most of the recruited volunteers referred themselves, and many expressed a preference for psilocybin over escitalopram. This created a selected trial population and limits generalization of the results The patients in the trial were not from diverse ethnic or socioeconomic backgrounds. Strategies to improve recruitment of more diverse study populations are needed in studies of psilocybin for depression. Also, average symptom severity scores at baseline were in the range for moderate depression, thus limiting extrapolations to patients with severe depressive symptoms or treatment-resistant depression Psychedelic agents have been shown to enhance suggestibility,23 and their psychological effects are assumed to be context-dependent.24,25 In other words, the content and subjective quality of the psychedelic experience is influenced by a person’s memories, perceptions, and degree to which the environment is supportive at the time of administration of the agent. In a study in which various psychedelic compounds were administered to rats, the compounds were shown to increase dendritic arbor complexity, promote dendritic spine growth, and stimulate synapse formation in the rat cortex, mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism,26 all of which are forms of neuronal plasticity that may be related to the principle that responses to psychedelics are especially dependent on contextual conditions This trial comparing psilocybin with escitalopram in a selected group of patients showed that the change in scores for depression at 6 weeks did not differ significantly between the trial groups. Secondary outcomes mostly favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the confidence intervals for the between-group differences were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are needed to compare psilocybin with established treatments for depression.",
51,10.1177/1455072517753339,"The purpose of this study was to explore how “ordinary” users of psychedelics approach psychedelic microdosing. The selection of users included in this study was not, however, representative of the population of psychedelics users, and the findings of the study therefore have no claim to general validity. Despite this shortcoming, the findings may serve to acquaint researchers with the, as of yet, understudied phenomenon of psychedelic microdosing The microdosing practices reported in this study generally conformed in regimen and dose to the recommendations published by Fadiman (2011), although some users experimented with daily microdoses. LSD and psilocybin-containing mushrooms were most commonly used, but some respondents also microdosed a wide range of lesser-known psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs. Respondents for the most part reported what they regarded as positive effects from microdosing, with few side effects. Microdoses most commonly served as mood and cognitive enhancers, allowing people to function at what they felt was a higher level than usual. There are clear parallels between psychedelic microdosing and the use of cognitive enhancement drugs among healthy individuals for performance improvements described by Corazza et al. (2014) and Hupli et al. (2016), as both forms of drug use can be motivated by a wish for enhanced performance in the workplace or in academic study However, there was also a therapeutic motivation for psychedelic microdosing among some of the respondents in this study who suffered from conditions such as anxiety or depression. These findings are congruent with reported effects from full doses of psychedelic drugs on conditions of depression and anxiety (Carhart-Harris & Nutt, 2010; Gasser et al., 2013; Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Johnstad, 2015; Ross et al., 2016). Reports about the efficacy of microdosing practices for conditions such as substance dependence, OCD, and PTSD also have parallels in research on therapeutic effects from psychedelics in full doses (Abramson, 1967; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2014; Krebs & Johansen, 2012; Nichols, 2004; Schenberg et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2013). It should be noted, however, that in the present study these observations were limited to one or a few individuals. Clinical research on microdosing should probably first look into putative anxiolytic and anti-depressive effects, but need not end there The lack of a clear distinction between therapy and enhancement that has been pointed to by anthropologists and sociologists who study enhancement technologies (Coveney et al., 2011; Hogle, 2005) is echoed in this study. Some respondents pointed to specific deficiencies that their use of psychedelic microdoses was intended to address, but there was an overlap between the use motivated by such therapeutic effects and the use motivated by an effect of enhancement. In either case, the desired effect from microdosing was to be lifted out of a state of relative limitation into a state of higher functioning. The difference was that in therapeutic use, the state of limitation corresponded with a specific medical diagnosis. One respondent explicitly challenged the notion that his “normal” or pre-microdosing state of being deserved the designation “healthy”, even though he had not been diagnosed with any specific ailment Some respondents experienced no effects from microdosing at all, however, and several others emphasised that, despite their positive experience, microdosing is no miracle cure. There were some indications that psychedelic microdoses might not retain their perceived beneficial effects over longer stretches of time, and that the use should therefore be constrained to phases, which was indeed the most common approach to microdosing among respondents with extensive experience. This reduction of effect over time might limit the medical value of microdosing psychedelics, and would seem to be an important area of investigation for subsequent clinical research of microdosing The most commonly reported challenges with microdosing were overdosing and insomnia. Overdosing in this case means going beyond microdose territory into a mini-dose that has some intoxicating effect. Such mini-doses are not by themselves overly problematic for experienced psychedelics users, but might have serious negative consequences for users who combine microdosing with work, driving a car, and other activities not compatible with drug intoxication. The overdosing problem applies both to LSD and to psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The former is fully active in doses of a hundred micrograms, and a microdose is often obtained, rather inexactly, by cutting a blotter into separate pieces. Mushrooms for their part may be subject to a natural variation in psilocybin content (Rätsch, 2005). Clinical applications of microdosing could solve this problem by supplying standardised microdoses, but would have to trust their clients not to take several doses at the same time The few negative reports about microdosing in this study were not apparently a result of overdosing, nor is there any other obvious explanation for their occurrence. While these negative experiences constitute a minority, it is important to note that some people may experience distinctly unpleasant effects as a result of microdosing. The reported “bad trip” might appear to be a product more of cannabis use than of the LSD microdose, but damage-reduction publications such as tripsafe.org often warn that cannabis might potentiate psychedelic drugs The question of whether microdosing of psychedelic drugs should be characterised as “abuse”, which was Corazza et al.’s (2014) label for piracetam use among healthy individuals, or as “functional drug use”, which Hupli et al. (2016) argued is the best way to understand the use of cognitive enhancement drugs, is not easily answered. Psychedelics are designated as drugs of abuse in most of the world, but there is a substantial research literature that indicates that their use may have therapeutic effect. It is possible that microdosing may allow users to procure some of the perceived positive effects of these drugs while avoiding the problems that may follow from taking them in full doses As a social phenomenon, we can perhaps understand psychedelic microdosing in light of Coveney et al.’s (2011) observation that the cultural authority of medical experts may be subject to change. Much medical knowledge is now readily available on the Internet, and electronic fora for psychedelic users serve as knowledge repositories that integrate shared user experiences with medical and neuroscientific information. This has resulted in increased knowledge availability (or at least in the perception of increased knowledge availability), which may have caused a corresponding decrease in the cultural authority of medical experts. The growth of microdosing may therefore reflect a social development in which ordinary people use the Internet for medical advice and feel empowered to take personal responsibility for their medication needs, pursuing therapy and enhancement through means that the medical establishment does not recognise and would perhaps frown upon There are no published studies on microdosing with which the findings of this study may be compared. The reports of therapy and enhancement, which constitute the majority here, conform to the findings of previously published anecdotal reports (Fadiman, 2011; Solon, 2016; Waldman, 2017), while the reports of no effect or negative effect are, as far as I can determine, without counterpart. This may reflect a bias towards beneficial effects in anecdotal reports, which Partridge et al. (2011) found to be a problem for media reports about enhancement drugs, or perhaps it may be that the method used in this study has been more conducive to obtaining balanced information There is no way to differentiate between drug effects and positive or negative expectation effects (placebo/nocebo) in these data, but the study affords an understanding of how “ordinary” users of psychedelics approach psychedelic microdosing. Several respondents expressed nuanced views about the relative benefits and disadvantages of microdosing that were not in any obvious manner indebted to placebo or nocebo effects. They also reported discovering specific practices that have worked well for them, compared to others that were found to be ineffectual or subject to negative side effects. Confidence in the reports is therefore increased by their high degree of specificity, as curative or symptom-abating effect was often reported only for one of several drugs that respondents used Another overall finding from this study is the value of tapping the psychedelic Internet community for academic studies. It is unknown whether this segment of Internet-active users is representative of the general psychedelic-using population, but the discussion fora frequented by these users are probably among the best recruitment arenas available to researchers. The respondents in this study were reflective, knowledgeable, and fully capable of expressing their views, and their participation would be an asset to any study of psychedelic drug use. It is possible, however, that a less erudite group of psychedelics users would have a less constructive and self-reflective approach to microdosing, and the study has nothing to say about the attractions of microdosing to women. The findings from this study should therefore be taken to reflect the microdosing experiences of a resourceful group of male psychedelic users, and have value primarily to the extent that they may provide subsequent investigations with research questions and hypotheses.",
52,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.09.012,"Eleven clinical trials were identified in which therapeutic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens were evaluated in patients with a life-threatening disease. Studies can be divided into three major subgroups: 1) initial trials which focused on analgesic effects of psychedelics, where psychological effects were merely considered as side effects, sometimes surprisingly associated with improved disease coping strategies and attitudes (Kast, 1967, Kast, 1966; Kast and Collins, 1964); 2) clinical trials conducted during the 1960s and 1970s, mostly at Spring Grove, where psychological effects of psychedelics were primarily focused in the framework of ‘Psychedelic (Peak) Therapy’ (PDT). In these studies, the classical variables of ‘set’ (referring to the patient's mind-set, history, health, personality, social and emotional situation), ‘setting’ (referring to the physical environment, study personnel, music selection and other stimulus during the session) and ‘substance’ (referring to type, dosage and frequency of the employed psychoactives) were carefully considered (Grof et al., 1973; Pahnke et al., 1969; Richards et al., 1980), and preparatory and post-treatment therapy sessions were understood as a vital part of the treatment process (Halifax and Grof, 1977; Kurland, 1985; Maslow, 1962; Sherwood et al., 1962). In the course of this close meshed patient care, fewer psychological adverse events such as panic reactions were described and up to two-thirds of the patients experienced reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy showed effective and promising results. 3) A third group includes recent clinical trials, carried out after a long hiatus period of legal restrictions (Gasser et al., 2014a, Gasser et al., 2014b; Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016), in which previous methods were reconsidered, aiming to induce insightful psychological experiences at somewhat lower dosages and with psilocybin being the predominant substance. These trials do not exhibit any fundamentally new conceptual framework, but they are of a substantially increased methodological quality (placebo control, randomization, double-blinding, use of modern psychiatric diagnostic classification and rating scales and long-term follow up). Mystical-type experiences have been repeatedly suggested as mechanisms of action, showing a conceptual proximity to the historical concept of ‘Psychedelic (Peak) Therapy’ (PDT) (Grof, 1980). However, PDT has been predominantly carried out in the US until the 1970s involving high dosages of psychedelics aiming to induce ‘peak experiences’. In contrast, in Europe, traditionally lower dosages have been employed in the framework of ‘Psycholytic Therapy’ (PLT), not necessarily aiming at inducing peak experiences (Majić et al., 2015). On the other hand, it has been reported that patients might have mystical experiences without profound impact on their lives and, vice versa, others might not have made these kind of experiences but still have profoundly benefitted from the treatment. Thus, we believe that mystical or peak experiences might be important, but there are other important factors as well that are responsible for the therapeutic effects of psychedelic-assisted therapy","From today's viewpoint, most of the studies before the year 2000 show strong methodological limitations. While early results were mainly based on anecdotal evidence, later results were based on non-standardized outcome criteria and were not compared with any control group. Additionally, no long-term follow-up studies of the patients were carried out. In regard to the open study design the trials carry a high risk of bias. Most studies also lack detailed methodical descriptions of the populations, diagnosis methods, psychotherapeutic interventions and statistical analysis Nevertheless, recent double-blind, randomized and controlled studies show some limitations in their study set-up. The blinding process is only possible to a limited extent since psychedelics produce unique characteristic psychoactive effects, which reveal the allocation in treatment or control group to patient and therapist (Gasser et al., 2014a; Grob et al., 2011; Mogar, 1967; Salzman and Hicks, 1969). Methods to counteract this phenomenon are the administration of the active placebo niacin or small dosages of the psychedelic compound but are only successful to a limited extent. Therefore, in combination with the subjective outcome measures based on clinician- and patient-administered rating scales, recent studies still carry a risk of bias. Furthermore, the obtained follow-up data are only conclusive to a limited extent, after control groups have also received an active therapeutic dose of the psychedelic compound within the applied cross-over design. The authors argued that the reason for the uncontrolled study design in the early studies and the cross-over design in more recent studies, were also because of ethical reasons, since it would be ethically questionable to withhold a potential beneficial treatment concept or to run a placebo control group over such a long period in regard to the patient's severe illness and reduced life expectancy (Gasser et al., 2014b; Grob et al., 2013, Grob et al., 2011). With regard to the generalizability of the results, the strict exclusion criteria (see below) under which the patients for the studies have been recruited constitute a restriction. Also, the high percentage of highly educated people in the population and the fact that around half of the patients reported a prior history of hallucinogen use in recent studies (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016), further limits the generalizability. In conclusion, there is some evidence that substance-assisted psychotherapy with serotonergic hallucinogens is effective in the treatment of mental health problems in patients with a life-threatening disease and is well tolerated. Moreover, there is some evidence that psychedelic-induced mystical-type peak experiences mediate not only reduction of psychiatric symptoms in these patients, but may also be helpful for these patients by improving disease coping and quality of life when facing a life-threatening condition. Given the reasonable safety profile of serotonergic hallucinogens in a controlled clinical environment, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy could be a promising treatment option in this context – especially for patients where other approaches have been ineffective. Hence, additional trials are needed to evaluate whether the presented results can be transferred in to clinical practice."
53,10.1177/0269881116628430,"This study sought to assess the effects of LSD on spontaneous mental time travel and relate this to the drug’s neurobiological effects. Results revealed a selective reduction in the number of linguistic references to mental time travel to the past under LSD. Moreover, there was a relationship between the general intensity of LSD’s subjective effects and the reduction in mental time travel to the past, further supporting the assumption that the effect was driven by LSD. Results provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of this effect, as decreased DMN integrity correlated with reduced mental time travel to the past Prior research links the DMN to autobiographical memory (Spreng et al., 2009) and self-reflection (Gusnard et al., 2001), as psychological functions relevant to the notion of the self or ego (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). This fits in with the present data on the correlation between decreased integrity within this particular brain network and reduced time travel to the past. The DMN appears to subserve spontaneous cognition and particularly cognition that has an introspective and itinerant (i.e. freely-wandering) quality (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010) Many brain networks receive a driving input from the external world (e.g. for the visual system this input is light activating cells in the retina) and therefore possess a relatively secure anchor point. The DMN, however, does not possess such an obvious anchor point. If an equivalent ‘driving input’ was to exist for the DMN, it would likely have an endogenous or intrinsic origin (e.g. a structure or system already within the brain) and be hierarchically inferior (e.g. evolutionarily older) to the cortical DMN. The DMN is known to possess strong anatomical and functional connections with the hippocampus, via the parahippocampal cortex (Ward et al., 2014). Hippocampal to cortical-DMN RSFC has been found to correlate with the prevalence of mental time travel (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010); moreover, given the classic association between the hippocampus and autobiographical memory (e.g. Fletcher et al., 1997), it seems logical to suspect that the hippocampal-DMN circuit is important, not just for autobiographical memory recollection, but for the preservation of the sense of self or ego. Support for this hypothesis is provided by evidence that the hippocampal-DMN circuit undergoes significant development during maturation (Supekar et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2015), and that the psychedelic, psilocybin, decreases parahippocampal to cortex RSFC in a manner that correlates with ego-dissolution (Lebedev et al., 2015). Further work is required to test and develop the hypothesis that the hippocampus-DMN circuit is important for the maintenance of one’s sense of self and its reliance on autobiographical information The present results may help to extend our knowledge of the psychological effects of LSD and could inspire a new perspective on the construct of ‘ego-dissolution’. Ego-dissolution is an abstract construct, yet it is generally considered to be an important feature of the psychedelic experience, especially at higher doses, and it is often described by users of psychedelics (Turton et al., 2014). Moreover, the phenomenology of psychedelic-induced ego-dissolution overlaps with the phenomenology of ego-disturbances in early psychosis (Lebedev et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2012; Schneider, 1959), as well as classic accounts of ‘self-loss’ in spontaneous religious, spiritual or mystical experiences (James and Bradley, 2012). However, although the experience of ego-dissolution is often described in relation to the psychedelic experience, it is not always clear what is meant by this. It has yet to be investigated if the experience of ego-dissolution under psychedelics is conceptually similar to ego-disturbances in psychosis: Self-disorder in psychosis focuses on a basic, minimal, or core self, also known as ipseity (Nelson et al., 2014; Zahavi, 2005). Further studies could compare phenomenological similarities and differences between the concept of ego disturbances and the concept of ego dissolution, using the linguistic tool presented in the current study. If similarities were to be observed, this would substantiate the LSD state as a model of psychosis (Carhart-Harris et al. 2015) The notion of ‘the narrative self’ and ‘narrative identity’ (Habermas and Bluck, 2000) may be particularly relevant to the findings of the present study and how they relate to psychedelic-induced ego-dissolution. The importance of accessing and rehearsing autobiographical information for the development of a narrative self has been well demonstrated (Pasupathi and Hoyt, 2009). Thus, the existence of a secure sense of self or ego may depend on a regular input or ‘feed’ from autobiographical memory into consciousness (Fivush and Nelson, 2006), and if this feed is suspended, then the self/ego may collapse (Turton et al., 2014). Based on prior findings (Lebedev et al., 2015), we speculate that the hippocampal-DMN circuit may be an important part of such a ‘feed’ The therapeutic potential of LSD for psychotherapy is currently being revisited (Gasser et al., 2014). LSD has a history of use as an adjunct to psychotherapy, and was originally thought to lower psychological defences and facilitate emotional insight and release, i.e. ‘catharsis’ (Cohen, 1967; Kaelen et al., 2015). The present finding of decreased mental time travel to the past under LSD may seem contradictory when one considers that a major rationale for using LSD in psychotherapy is that it can facilitate emotional insight, often via stimulating personal memories and associated affect (Cohen, 1967). Indeed, patients undergoing psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy often report re-experiencing past memories with an unusual vividness, an experience sometimes referred to as ‘reliving’ (Grof, 1979; Sandison, 1954) and facilitated recollection of positive episodic memories was demonstrated in a controlled experiment with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b) How can such improved access to autobiographical memory be reconciled with the present finding of less spontaneous reflections on the past under LSD? An explanation for this paradox may be found in the nature of the phenomena themselves, as well as how they are tested and measured. For example, spontaneous recollections or relivings that occur in early psychedelic-psychotherapy often relate to highly salient, personal themes, e.g. familial and/or intimate relationships and highly salient and/or traumatic events that may be temporally remote, e.g. sometimes dating back to childhood (Grof, 1979; Sandison, 1954), such as the following Standing about 4 yards away was my father with his fishing rod…. The sun was shining and the whole scene was peaceful and lovely… all the rest of the day and ever since that picture has remained with me as something too precious to part with because my father has died just before my illness. That is three years this year, and owing to his illness we hadn’t fished for some two years…. (Sandison et al., 1954: 497 Yet the kind of comments coded as reflections on the past in the present study appear to be less emotionally potent and are typically more recent: ‘Thinking about… random stuff which happened in the last few days’ (Placebo example, Table 1). Thus, during normal waking consciousness, mental time travel to the past may occur with greater regularly than in the psychedelic state; however, the content of these reflections may be more anodyne and (ego) syntonic or unthreatening. Moreover, it should be acknowledged that psychedelic-psychotherapy occurs in a relatively distinctive context, i.e. a patient with mental health problems receives treatment with a psychotherapeutic focus. Further work is required to investigate whether the present findings in healthy volunteers can be replicated in a patient population in a therapeutic context Where facilitated autobiographical memory recollection has been demonstrated in controlled research with a psychedelic (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b), participants were explicitly cued to recollect positive episodic memories. This is quite a different procedure to coding natural speech for spontaneous reflections on the past, present and future, and thus, the outcomes derived from these two different approaches cannot be easily compared. One should also consider that individuals demonstrate hypersuggestibility under psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015), and thus, reports of psychedelic-enhanced autobiographical memory recollection in controlled studies (where hypotheses may be easy to intuit) may be biased or, at least confounded, by enhanced suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015). Measures of spontaneous cognition (as were employed here) may be particularly useful and informative in this regard, since the experimental aims and hypotheses motivating these measures are effectively hidden The raters using the tool of quantitative linguistic analysis in this study evaluated it as easy to apply, and indeed the inter-rater reliability was very high. This tool has been used effectively in previous studies to differentiate between (altered) states of consciousness (e.g. in sleep and waking states, and under electrostimulation; Speth and Speth, unpublished, 2016; Speth et al., 2015) as well as here with LSD. This helps to develop its utility as a means to quantify markers of different states of consciousness Mentation reports produced post-LSD were longer and more elaborate than those given post-placebo. This ties in with findings from other studies of altered states of consciousness, and especially dream research: mentation reports conceived after forced awakenings from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are known to be longer than reports conceived after non-REM sleep or sleep onset (Stickgold et al., 2001). This was one of the reasons why REM dreams have been interpreted as emotionally richer and more vivid. Their hallucinatory quality has been compared to acute states of psychosis (Hobson, 1997, 2004), as has the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris, 2007, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). It is thus not surprising that a (hallucinatory) psychedelic waking experience likewise results in longer reports than a normal relaxed waking experience. It could prove fruitful to consciousness research if the similarities and differences between spontaneously occurring hallucinatory states (e.g. REM dreaming or hypnagogic hallucinations) and pharmacologically induced hallucinatory states (e.g. after LSD or psilocybin) were further explored by applying quantitative linguistic analysis and related quantitative tools, ideally in physiology-monitored experimental settings and within-subject designs (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2014) It is important to highlight some limitations of the present study. One of these relates to the fact that participants were intoxicated on LSD when asked to deliver their retrospective accounts of their experience in the MRI scanner. This makes it difficult to determine whether the main effects reported here (i.e. reduced mental time travel to the past) are reflective of the acute intoxication state (which we assume) or the content of the participants’ descriptions about their experiences in the scanner, and so the nature of their retrospective thinking. Since the present analyses cannot make this differentiation, one way to address it in future studies might be to ask participants about their present state, e.g. with questions such as ‘How do you feel right now? There is also an important limitation which is related to the correlation analysis. It has been argued before that sample sizes in neuroimaging studies are commonly too small to yield reliable, replicable findings and that many reported positive outcomes may therefore be false positives (Button et al., 2013). It would be sensible to caution therefore that the present study’s sample size of n=15 (for the fMRI) may be too small to demonstrate a reliable relationship between individual differences in DMN connectivity and mental time travel and greater sample sizes are therefore advised for future studies Another important limitation of the present study’s findings must be considered. Namely, it could be inferred that the observed reduction in reflection on the past under LSD is not the result of a specific action of the drug on this specific measure but rather a product of a more general effect of LSD on cognition. If this interpretation were true, any intoxicant (i.e. not just LSD) that alters cognition in a profound way, might impact on mentation about the past. However, if this were true, then it might also apply to mentation about the future, but there was no effect of LSD on this measure. Moreover, the reduced mentation about the past was not caused by participants simply reporting less in their interviews on LSD; in fact, LSD interviews were significantly more elaborate and lengthy than the placebo ones (see Supplementary Material for a fuller discussion of this matter). This alternative explanation for the present results could be explored by examining the effects of other intoxicants, with quite different psychological effects to LSD (e.g. alcohol or amphetamine), on the same measures, to see whether consistent results are observed. Beyond pharmacological manipulations, the effects of other exhilarating experiences on the same measures might also be investigated. These important validity checks would inform on whether the effect of psychedelics on past-focused mentation is indeed exclusive to this class of drugs, or rather something more generally associated with intoxication and/or exhilarating experiences If the reported effect of LSD on past-focused reflection is relatively exclusive to psychedelics, then this may say something more interesting about them. The therapeutic potential of psychedelics is currently being revisited, with promising preliminary results (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Gasser et al., 2014; Grob et al., 2011; Osorio Fde et al., 2015). Inspired by the findings of neuroimaging research with psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), our team are currently investigating the antidepressant potential of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression, and again, the initial results are very promising. fMRI studies with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a), ayahuasca (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015) and LSD (Carhart-Harris, 2015) have all shown decreased DMN RSFC, as have fMRI studies with meditation (Brewer et al., 2011; Farb et al., 2007; Hasenkamp et al., 2012), whereas DMN RSFC has been found to be elevated in depression (Greicius et al., 2007), and to correlate positively with ruminative thinking (Berman et al., 2011) The present analyses found a decrease in mental time travel to the past under LSD. Previous work has shown that daydreaming about the past is associated with low mood (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010) and popular treatments for depression, such as mindfulness-based psychotherapy, encourage patients to adopt a more present-focused style of thinking (Shapiro et al., 2006). It is intriguing to consider whether psychedelics work in a similar way to mindfulness-based therapies; promoting a mental state that is less focused on the past and therefore less unhappy (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010) – and there is some recent evidence to support this (Soler et al. 2016). It would be interesting to extend this work to enquire whether any mindfulness-promoting effects of psychedelics are be mediated by decreases in intra-DMN functional connectivity The present study has found decreased mentation on the past in conjunction with decreased DMN integrity under the acute effects of LSD; however, further work is now required to test whether the same effect can be observed after the acute effects of LSD have subsided. If the results of previous controlled studies with psychedelics (Griffiths et al., 2008), as well as subjective reports of participants from our own previous studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a) are considered, then such enduring effects seem likely Ever since [the psilocybin session on] Thursday, I’d say I have found it much easier to engage in the moment – to attend to the here and now. Whether this be watching water in a fountain, or sitting in science talks and meetings this morning. There were some fountains in Cardiff and the water was being blown by the wind, allowing the sun to highlight the spray. I could have watched it for ages – somehow the beauty was enhanced…. Whatever it was, it has lasted – like the sun shining through the leaves this morning, it made me slow down my walk to work and enjoy the experience of it flickering over my face.","In conclusion, the present study sought to investigate the effect of LSD on mental time travel to the past, present and future. Results revealed a selective effect of LSD on mental spaces linked to the past, i.e. there were significantly fewer cases of mental time travel to the past under LSD than placebo, and this effect correlated with the general intensity of LSD’s subjective effects. These outcomes shed light on the phenomenon of ego-dissolution and specifically a decomposition of the ‘narrative-self’ or ‘narrative identity’, which is strongly associated with autobiographical thought (Pasupathi and Hoyt, 2009). A specific hypothesis was tested that this phenomenon relates to decreased DMN integrity, and this was supported by the data. The findings were discussed in relation to potential therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs, with a particular focus on depression. Further research is required to investigate the robustness, reliability and specificity of the reported findings."
54,10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.020,"Major hurdles facing research with psychedelics include the burden that their Schedule 1 status incurs and a lack of mainstream funding, and we suspect these things are related. The Schedule 1 status of psychedelics led to vastly increased regulations on research, associated costs, and damaging stigma that likely deterred governmental agencies, other reputable funding bodies, and companies from backing the relevant research. Before LSD was banned, the US NIH funded over 130 studies exploring its clinical utility; however, since the ban, it has funded none and until a few years ago, no company was committed to manufacturing medical grade psychedelics and thus procurement of the required drugs for clinical trials was almost impossible (Nutt, 2015) Nowadays, both COMPASS Pathways and Usona are making psilocybin at scale with others starting. Natural plant-based products such as ayahuasca, peyote, and magic mushrooms are now legal in some South American countries and are becoming decriminalized in a few US cities. Moreover, magic mushrooms could be legalized in the US state of Oregon later this year. Magic truffles, which contain the same active compound, are legal in the Netherlands, and this loophole, combined with a growing interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, has led to fast-growing industry in Dutch truffle retreats. Some finance journalists have begun predicting a “shroom boom” to rival the “green rush” seen with medicinal cannabis (Raphael, 2018). This escalating recreational use presents an opportunity to collect “Big Data” for educational and harm-reduction purposes, and we have set-up an online platform for doing this, called psychedelicsurvey.com It is possible to make new 5-HT2A receptor agonist ligands that would, at the time of synthesis, be outside national or UN Conventions. However, based on recent examples, the risk of them becoming restricted would be very high. In the UK, the ultra-restrictive 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act makes all novel psychoactive compounds illegal, and some of the newer 5-HT2A receptor agonists (e.g., the NBOMeS) have been found to be more toxic than the older ones, a situation similar to that seen with the growth of legal but more harmful synthetic cannabinoids Overall, it seems the best way forward to fostering research and therapeutic application is to press for a rescheduling of psychedelics with proven therapeutic utility, especially psilocybin. That psilocybin was made Schedule 1 (i.e., having no medical value) on the shirt-tails of politically motivated banning of LSD has had an immense negative effect on treatment and research (Nutt, 2015). A campaign to re-schedule psilocybin is now underway in the UK, led by the charity DrugScience.org.uk and has international, scientific support","The resurrection of research into the neuroscience and therapeutic application of psychedelics represents one of the most important initiatives in psychiatry and brain science in recent decades. It rectifies decades of global research paralysis that emerged as collateral damage from the war on drugs and that has become one of the worst examples of censorship of human research in the history of science. The past ten years have seen the first green shoots of recovery with a number of teams across several continents beginning human neuroimaging and clinical trials that have delivered remarkable insights into brain function and instigated an exciting new approach to the treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders (Table 1). What is now needed is a combined, multi-level, multidisciplinary program of research into the mechanisms underpinning these findings."
55,10.1177/0269881117748902,"The present study sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin with psychological support on nature relatedness and authoritarianism in patients with TRD. Patients reported a greater connection with nature 1 week after treatment. This increase in nature relatedness was sustained at the 7–12-months follow-up. One week post-treatment a significant decrease in authoritarianism was also observed, and at the 7–12-month follow-up the decrease was at trend level. No significant differences in nature relatedness, authoritarianism or depressive symptoms were found in an age and education-matched group of control subjects measured over an equivalent time period, thus supporting the inference that the changes were not due to order effects. Taken together, these findings indicate that the psychologically supportive administration of psilocybin might induce sustained changes in attitudes and beliefs, including feeling closer to nature and less allied to authoritarian views The reduction of depressive symptoms following psilocybin treatment found here is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). Long-term improvements in psychological wellbeing (Griffiths et al., 2008) and trait openness and optimism (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; MacLean et al., 2011; Schmid and Liechti, 2017) have been observed in healthy volunteers following a single exposure to a psychedelic drug. A single dose of psilocybin has also been shown to induce enduring reductions in anxiety and depression as well as increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism in patients with anxiety reactive to advanced-stage cancer (Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016). Furthermore, rapid and sustained antidepressant effects were found in patients with recurrent MDD that were treated with a single dose of the plant-based psychedelic brew, ayahuasca (Osorio Fde et al., 2015) Evidence suggests that greater nature relatedness is associated with lower anxiety (Martyn and Brymer, 2014) and greater personal wellbeing (Capaldi et al., 2014; Cervinka et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2011; Mayer and Frantz, 2004; Mayer et al., 2008; Nisbet and Zelenski, 2011; Nisbet et al., 2011; Zelenski and Nisbet, 2014), and that exposure to awe-inspiring nature may increase pro-social behaviour (Piff et al., 2015) – perhaps through a related mechanism of seeing oneself as small in relation to the vastness of nature. Here, we show that the TRD patients felt more connected to nature up to 7–12 months after psilocybin treatment. This is consistent with a previous study in healthy participants in which 38% of the sample reported enduring positive changes in their relationship to nature and the environment 8–16 months post-psilocybin (Studerus et al., 2011). Psychedelic use in a large sample of web-survey respondents was found to positively predict nature relatedness (Nour et al., 2017); moreover, as with nature-inspiring experiences of awe (Piff et al., 2015), this relationship was strongest in people who experienced the greatest ego-dissolution during their most intense psychedelic experience (Nour et al., 2017) Psychedelic users have been found to rate themselves as more concerned with the environment than users of other illicit substances (Lerner and Lyvers, 2006; Nour et al., 2017). Interacting with nature has been shown to have cognitive and affective benefits in healthy individuals (Berman et al., 2008) and patients with MDD (Berman et al., 2012). Although we found no correlation between the changes in nature relatedness or authoritarianism and changes in depression in the patients, this may simply have been due to the small sample size (n=7), or it is possible that a measure of mental wellbeing may have been more sensitive to such a relationship than the presently used measure of depression. There is, however, evidence to suggest that nature exposure decreases rumination as well as activity in brain regions implicated in depression (Hamilton et al., 2015), namely the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC) and regions of the default mode network (DMN) (Bratman et al., 2015). Interestingly, the administration of psilocybin has also been shown to acutely decrease sgPFC and DMN blood flow and within-network functional integrity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2015) and to increase global connectivity in the brain (Petri et al., 2014; Roseman et al., 2016). Further work is required to test the hypotheses that a renewed sense of ‘connectedness’, including feeling connected to nature, is a key factor determining therapeutic outcomes in psychedelic therapy (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b) and to better elucidate its basis in the brain. A working hypothesis is that increased global connectivity in the brain and its relationship to ego-dissolution (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016) and associated ‘connectedness’ (Watts et al., 2017b) is a key mediating factor (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b) Psychedelic drug use in the 1960s and 1970s was strongly associated with anti-establishment and egalitarian counter-culture movements (Nichols, 2016), yet very little controlled research has investigated the link between psychedelic use and political perspectives. Here we show for the first time, in a controlled study, lasting changes in political values after exposure to a psychedelic drug. This is in line with early research showing that recreational LSD users score higher on attitudes of ‘personal liberty’ and ‘foreign policy liberalism’ than control subjects (McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971). Psychedelic users have also been shown to score higher on ‘concern for others’ and place lower value on ‘financial prosperity’ than non-users of illicit substances as well as users of amphetamine, cannabis or heroin (Lerner and Lyvers, 2006). Given that psychedelics act through the serotonin system, it is interesting that serotonin has been implicated in the assessment of harm in moral decision-making, altruistic punishment and fairness (Crockett et al., 2008, 2010, 2013; Story et al., 2015). Moreover, psychedelics have been shown to increase trait openness (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Griffiths et al., 2008; MacLean et al., 2011), and a substantial body of evidence demonstrates a positive association between openness and liberalism within individuals (Carney et al., 2008; Nour et al., 2017; Sibley et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013). Relatedly, the role of the serotonin 2A receptor, the key site of action of psychedelics, in mediating ‘conversion-type’ or ‘quantum change’ (Miller, 2004) experiences has recently been discussed (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) There are a number of important limitations to this study that must be considered when interpreting the results. The study formed part of an open-label clinical trial with a small sample size. The sample was smaller still for the NR-6 and PPQ-5, as these measures were introduced late in the trial due to inspiration from a separate project of ours (Nour et al., 2017). Also, although we recruited a control group to examine test–retest reliability on these measures, the controls were healthy subjects and were not exposed to the same treatment procedures. Critically, since treatment with psilocybin involved more than just drug administration (e.g. psychological support before and after the psilocybin dosing sessions), it is quite possible that drug-unrelated factors contributed to the changes in NR-6 and PPQ-5 scores observed here. The caring therapeutic model may have been one such factor. A large double-blind randomised control trial, ideally with an active control condition (to try and maintain the study blind), is required to more rigorously test the possible causal association between psilocybin and changes in nature relatedness and political perspective reported here. It would be hasty, therefore, to attempt any strong claims about a causal influence due specifically to psilocybin at this stage, and we should also be aware of anomalies in the relationship between psychedelic use and left-wing politics (Henrik, 2017); however, intriguing questions relating to psychedelics and political/philosophical perspectives remain A further limitation concerns the gender matching of control subjects and TRD patients; all TRD patients were male, whereas there were more females (71%) than males (29%) in the control condition. Thus, our findings in the TRD group cannot necessarily be extrapolated to females and the possibility of a gender effect cannot be discounted, and neither can we directly extrapolate the present findings to non-depressed populations The specificity of our main results also requires careful consideration. The question remains to be addressed whether the reported changes in nature relatedness and authoritarianism observed here post-treatment with psilocybin were selective for these outcomes, or rather an epiphenomenon of the treatment’s core effects on depressive symptoms. The question of causality is of central relevance here, and only further research can elucidate this. In this context, we would like to propose that there is a common mediating factor at play, driving both the improvements in mental health and changes in belief systems seen here – as well as elsewhere with psilocybin and other psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Hendricks et al., 2015b; Krebs and Johansen, 2013; MacLean et al., 2011). Such a common factor could be seen as a mental health equivalent of the general intelligence factor (e.g. Spearman’s g) in cognitive science (Spearman, 1987; Spiegelman, 2010). More specifically, in line with a recent commentary from our team (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b) we propose that connectedness is this factor (see Carhart-Harris et al. (2018b); Watts et al. (2017b)), and that psychedelics positively and potently modulate this Connectedness is a construct in need of development, but related concepts can be found in the literature (Alexander, 2010). In brief, connectedness can be defined as a sense of feeling connected to one’s self (i.e. a sense of feeling emotionally and somatically integrated and at peace) as well as others (e.g. one’s partner, family, friends, colleagues and community) and the world more generally (e.g. feeling connected to nature and a guiding ethical and/or philosophical principle), as described in our recent work (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b). Thus, a remediating effect on feelings of disconnectedness, characteristic of a broad swathe of mental illness (Alexander, 2010), may underlie both the improvements in depressive symptoms and the relevant changes in political perspective reported here What of the association between mental health and political perspective? There is some support for a link between lower authoritarianism and better mental health (Amodio et al., 2007; Hirsh et al., 2010; Jost et al., 2003), although there are also some contradictory findings (Verhulst et al., 2016; Vigil, 2010). The idea that drugs, including legal ones such as alcohol (Nour et al., 2016) and caffeine (Carpenter, 2015), and medications such as stimulants (Ohler and Whiteside, 2017) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Kramer, 1997) can modulate belief systems, including political perspective, is relatively new – but one that may be fundamentally important, with potentially profound implications. If, for example, it was found that excessive alcohol use promotes a detachment from nature (Nour et al., 2016), chronic stimulant use promotes an aggressive industriousness and hubris – and potential for paranoia (Ohler and Whiteside, 2017) – and psychedelic experiences promote a generalised sense of connectedness (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b), including greater altruism (Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017; Schmid and Liechti, 2017), what implications would this have for societies and their policies on such drugs? This and related topics may be seen as part of a new branch of political science, focused on the psychology and neurobiology of political perspective (Amodio et al., 2007; Everett et al., 2015; Haidt, 2013; Kanai et al., 2011; Kaplan et al., 2016; Nash et al., 2017) Finally, we are keen to avoid a value judgement about the political changes that may (or may not) be attributable to psychedelic use. For some, ecological considerations (e.g. captured by nature relatedness) may be assigned the greatest importance (Lovelock and Hudson, 2016), particularly when considering the scale and seriousness of the problem posed by climate change, for example (Prüss-Ustün et al., 2016), whereas others may recognise ‘order’ (e.g. captured in part by our authoritarianism scale) as an essential and functional counterweight to lawlessness (Bejan, 2017; Haidt, 2013). Testing whether psychedelic use is ‘beneficial for society’ would be a complex project, not least because opinions will differ on how to define ‘beneficial’ (although see Harris (2010) for a thought-provoking discussion on this matter). Even so, exploring the potential of psychedelics to moderate extremist views, and/or facilitate reconciliation, might be worth exploring, given the present results and wider supporting literature (Amodio et al., 2007; Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Hirsh et al., 2010; Jost et al., 2003; Watts et al., 2017a) In conclusion, this study sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin with psychological support on nature relatedness and authoritarian attitudes in patients with TRD. With significant caveats clearly highlighted, our findings tentatively raise the possibility that given in this way, psilocybin may produce sustained changes in outlook and political perspective, here in the direction of increased nature relatedness and decreased authoritarianism. These findings motivate further controlled studies to better determine the causality, reliability, specificity and durability of this relationship, as well as potential applications",
