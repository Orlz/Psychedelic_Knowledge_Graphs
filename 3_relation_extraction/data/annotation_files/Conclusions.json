After correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, male rats administered chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT exhibited a trend toward eating less food (p = 0.13, Figure S3c). Similar effects have been observed following administration of ayahuasca (60) and various serotonergic agonists. (61) Surprisingly, despite eating less food than vehicle-treated controls, the DMT-treated animals gained significantly more weight (Figure S3b). This contrasted with a previous report of chronic ayahuasca administration in rats, (60) and the reason for the discrepancy is not immediately obvious. Metabolomics experiments revealed that serum levels of most steroids remained unchanged following psychedelic microdosing. However, male rats treated with DMT did experience a nearly 50% reduction in estradiol levels, though the effect was not significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing In general, more work needs to be done to identify potential risks associated with the increasingly popular practice of psychedelic microdosing. While psychedelic-induced activation of mTOR in young adults might lead to changes in neural plasticity having beneficial effects on mood and anxiety, in some individuals, psychedelic microdosing could cause overstimulation of cortical neurons and actually exacerbate symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, nothing is known about the effects of psychedelic microdosing on neurodevelopment or the aging brain. As overactivation of mTOR has been proposed to contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (62) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), (63) more research is warranted to fully understand the risks associated with the chronic, intermittent use of psychedelics and related psychoplastogens While our study only assessed the impact of a single low dose of DMT administered on a chronic, intermittent schedule, it is important because it provides critical information about which behaviors are sensitive to psychedelic microdosing, and which are not, for both males and females. Moreover, it accomplished this using the minimal number of animals possible—an important ethical consideration. Follow-up studies can now hone in on particular behaviors of interest (e.g., FST or fear extinction) and perform dose–response or time–response studies. We still do not know if (1) lower doses would maintain therapeutic efficacy while minimizing changes in spine density or other potential side effects, or (2) if more complex dose–response relationships (e.g., U-shaped) are operative. Future studies examining dose–response effects and the impact of different dosing schedules are certainly warranted Despite the potential risks associated with psychedelic microdosing, the data presented here suggest several exciting possibilities for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. First, a chronic intermittent dosing regimen lends itself to the potential prophylactic treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. As acute doses of serotonergic psychedelics produce similar effects as an acute dose of the psychoplastogen ketamine, and ketamine has demonstrated promise for preventing stress-induced depression- and anxiety-related phenotypes in animal models, (64−66) it will be interesting to see if psychedelic microdosing is also capable of preventing the development of depression and anxiety symptoms. Second, the ability of low doses of DMT to produce positive effects on mood and anxiety in rats suggests that the perceptual effects of psychedelics can be decoupled from rats therapeutic properties. This could lead to the development of nonhallucinogenic psychoplastogens with broad therapeutic potential and minimal risk for abuse. Taken together, our results encourage cautious optimism about the potential for psychedelic microdosing to produce beneficial effects on depression and anxiety", "tokens": [{"text": "potential risks",

Within a dimensional or domain-based taxonomy of brain function and pathology, the reported findings are consistent with a trans-diagnostic process that may underlie both mood and substance use disorders. Reduction of negative affect may undermine ruminative processes that contribute to the development and maintenance of mood disorders, and these effects are consistent with psychological and neural changes that might be expected to accompany antidepressant effects of psilocybin. Disruption of the negative components of craving and withdrawal may undermine the development and maintenance of substance use disorders, consistent with psychological and clinical changes observed in patients with tobacco and alcohol use disorders. Reported findings may also account for long-term positive changes in mood, attitude, and well-being that have been reported in healthy individuals While both negative affect and brain response to affective stimuli were reduced 1 week after psilocybin, both rebounded at the 1 month timepoint, suggesting that psilocybin may have initiated a dynamic and neuroplastic process that was sustained for at least a number of weeks. It is possible that such a neuroplastic period may allow for a more enduring shift towards positive affective. The observed increase in functional connectivity strength indiscriminately across networks may reflect a domain-general cortical plasticity process supporting the observed changes in affective processing, consistent with preclinical evidence for psychoplastogenic properties of psychedelic drugs45,90.

Although limited conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy due to the crossover design, results suggests that the treatment continues to be associated with reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety up to an average of 4.5 years following a single psilocybin session in conjunction with psychotherapy. Theories regarding neurobiological and psychological change mechanisms remain speculative and exploratory. Further research will need to validate the main findings of the parent trial and this LTFU article with a fully experimental design in order to empirically establish the use of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat the psychiatric and existential distress of those with life-threatening cancer diagnoses An advanced experimental design of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy would likely include a larger sample size (i.e. N=200) that is nationally representative of cancer patients. An advanced experimental design of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy would also include randomized, parallel groups without a crossover, use of an adequate placebo control group, measures taken to minimize blinding and expectancy effects, and the use of valid and reliable outcome measures. An advanced experimental design of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy might also include design elements that would allow for exploration of potential neurobiological (e.g. growth factor expression, functional connectivity, neuroplasticity) and psychological (e.g. mystical experience, personality, psychological flexibility, emotional breakthroughs and insights, challenging experiences) mechanisms of action of psilocybin-assisted therapy Funding for psychedelic research in the USA remains mostly limited to the private sector at present time. It would be an historic and important milestone if the National Institutes of Health were to fund advanced research exploring the therapeutic potential of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with life-threatening cancer and concomitant psychiatric and existential distress. If the Food and Drug Administration were to sanction this next phase of research (i.e. phase III trials) for this clinical indication, and favorable findings were to emerge, the Food and Drug Administration could help to form a pathway for psilocybin to become re-scheduled and clinically available for cancer patients. the Food and Drug Administration would represent a major paradigm shift in the psycho-oncological approach and care of patients with cancer.

The controlled/ritualistic use of AYA has a good safety profile, and recent research has suggested that AYA can have therapeutic effects on the remission of some psychiatric disorders such as major depression and substance dependence However, these preliminary studies were not controlled and the long-term effects of AYA, as well as the mechanisms of action responsible for these effects, are still largely unknown and therefore need to be further clarified. Thus, the lack of studies highlights important gaps, such as the aforementioned lack of research with children and pregnant women who drink the tea.

Furthermore, more studies assessing the effects of AYA in naïve users are needed considering that most studies conducted so far assessed experienced AYA consumers, which may limit the generalizability of the results since these individuals are well adapted to long-term AYA use Therefore, more research is necessary to better understand the effects of AYA and AYA therapeutic potentials, avoiding the reckless spread of information devoid of scientific basis, which may interfere with the conduct adopted in clinical practice (Dos Santos et al., 2013b, 2016).", "tokens": [{"text": "AYA", "start": 87, "end": 90, "token_start": 10, "token_end": 10, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "performance of working memory", "start": 54, "end": 83, "token_start": 5, "token_end": 8, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "performance in other executive functions", "start": 145, "end": 185, "token_start": 20, "token_end": 24, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "planning", "start": 194, "end": 202, "token_start": 27, "token_end": 27, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "inhibitory control", "start": 207, "end": 225, "token_start": 29, "token_end": 30, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "AYA", "start": 454, "end": 457, "token_start": 72, "token_end": 72, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "good safety profile", "start": 464, "end": 483, "token_start": 75, "token_end": 77, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "AYA", "start": 524, "end": 527, "token_start": 85, "token_end": 85, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "therapeutic effects on the remission", "start": 537, "end": 573, "token_start": 88, "token_end": 92, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "major depression", "start": 612, "end": 628, "token_start": 99, "token_end": 100, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "substance dependence", "start": 633, "end": 653, "token_start": 102, "token_end": 103, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "AYA", "start": 1303, "end": 1306, "token_start": 216, "token_end": 216, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "health problems", "start": 1137, "end": 1152, "token_start": 190, "token_end": 191, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "AYA", "start": 1604, "end": 1607, "token_start": 266, "token_end": 266, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "therapeutic potentials", "start": 1616, "end": 1638, "token_start": 269, "token_end": 270, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}], "relations": [{"child": 5, "head": 10, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 20, "head": 10, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 27, "head": 10, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 29, "head": 10, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 75, "head": 72, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 88, "head": 85, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 99, "head": 72, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 102, "head": 72, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 190, "head": 216, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 269, "head": 266, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_18_2021-12-29_13:17:05.1.txt", "document": "The resurrection of research into the neuroscience and therapeutic application of psychedelics represents one of the most important initiatives in psychiatry and brain science in recent decades.

While early results were mainly based on anecdotal evidence, later results were based on non-standardized outcome criteria and were not compared with any control group. Additionally, no long-term follow-up studies of the patients were carried out. In regard to the open study design the trials carry a high risk of bias. Most studies also lack detailed methodical descriptions of the populations, diagnosis methods, psychotherapeutic interventions and statistical analysis Nevertheless, recent double-blind, randomized and controlled studies show some limitations in recent double-blind, randomized and controlled studies study set-up. The blinding process is only possible to a limited extent since psychedelics produce unique characteristic psychoactive effects, which reveal the allocation in treatment or control group to patient and therapist (Gasser et al., 2014a; Grob et al., 2011; Mogar, 1967; Salzman and Hicks, 1969). Methods to counteract this phenomenon are the administration of the active placebo niacin or small dosages of the psychedelic compound but are only successful to a limited extent. Therefore, in combination with the subjective outcome measures based on clinician- and patient-administered rating scales, recent studies still carry a risk of bias. Furthermore, the obtained follow-up data are only conclusive to a limited extent, after control groups have also received an active therapeutic dose of the psychedelic compound within the applied cross-over design. The authors argued that the reason for the uncontrolled study design in the early studies and the cross-over design in more recent studies, were also because of ethical reasons, since it would be ethically questionable to withhold a potential beneficial treatment concept or to run a placebo control group over such a long period in regard to the patient's severe illness and reduced life expectancy (Gasser et al., 2014b; Grob et al., 2013, Grob et al., 2011). With regard to the generalizability of the results, the strict exclusion criteria (see below) under which the patients for the studies have been recruited constitute a restriction. Also, the high percentage of highly educated people in the population and the fact that around half of the patients reported a prior history of hallucinogen use in recent studies (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016), further limits the generalizability. In conclusion, there is some evidence that substance-assisted psychotherapy with serotonergic hallucinogens is effective in the treatment of mental health problems in patients with a life-threatening disease and is well tolerated. Moreover, there is some evidence that psychedelic-induced mystical-type peak experiences mediate not only reduction of psychiatric symptoms in these patients, but may also be helpful for these patients by improving disease coping and quality of life when facing a life-threatening condition. Given the reasonable safety profile of serotonergic hallucinogens in a controlled clinical environment, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy could be a promising treatment option in this context – especially for patients where other approaches have been ineffective. Hence, additional trials are needed to evaluate whether the presented results can be transferred in to clinical practice.", "tokens": [{"text": "psychedelics", "start": 805, "end": 817, "token_start": 139, "token_end": 139, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "unique characteristic psychoactive effects", "start": 826, "end": 868, "token_start": 141, "token_end": 144, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "serotonergic hallucinogens", "start": 2580, "end": 2606, "token_start": 469, "token_end": 470, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "mental health problems", "start": 2640, "end": 2662, "token_start": 477, "token_end": 479, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "mystical-type peak experiences", "start": 2788, "end": 2818, "token_start": 503, "token_end": 507, "entityLabel": "SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE"}, {"text": "reduction of psychiatric symptoms", "start": 2836, "end": 2869, "token_start": 511, "token_end": 514, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "improving disease coping", "start": 2935, "end": 2959, "token_start": 528, "token_end": 530, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "quality of life", "start": 2964, "end": 2979, "token_start": 532, "token_end": 534, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}], "relations": [{"child": 141, "head": 139, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 477, "head": 469, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 511, "head": 503, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 528, "head": 503, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 532, "head": 503, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_15_2021-12-29_13:17:04.9.txt", "document": "It is estimated that nearly 20 000 people worldwide are members of some of the Brazilian ayahuasca religions (Santo Daime, UDV, Barquinha) [Labate et al. 2009]. The scientific literature suggests that acute ayahuasca administration to healthy volunteers has a good safety profile, and that long-term ritual ayahuasca consumption is not associated with cognitive or psychiatric problems [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. The psychotic episodes described in the present systematic review are apparently associated with several contributing factors, and not only ayahuasca or DMT intake. Many cases involved individuals with a personal or family history of psychosis or nonpsychotic bipolar disorder, or concomitant use of other drugs. Therefore, these individuals have a different profile from those that participate in controlled studies where a psychiatric screening is performed and use of other drugs is not allowed. Moreover, in controlled studies, only single or few ayahuasca/DMT doses are administered, and in some cases described, related to DMT use, the subjects have used several doses DMT before the subjects psychotic episode Previous reviews of adverse effects of hallucinogens in noncontrolled/recreational settings demonstrated that in reports ‘from the field’ it is very difficult to tease apart preexisting psychopathology, drug/alcohol abuse, family history, and other important features such as proper preparation, guidance, and integration of drug effects. Thus, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship with hallucinogen use and most of these cases [Klock et al. 1974; Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2014; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. In the case reports described in the present review, it is similarly difficult to determine the significance of ayahuasca/DMT use in such complicated settings, especially considering the safety record of ayahuasca/DMT administration in controlled clinical trials where rigorous screening, supervision, and follow up are provided Taken together, these results suggest that the incidence of psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca/DMT intake is a rare phenomenon, and these rare instances appear be associated with previous premorbid characteristics of the individuals, previous and possibly concurrent drug abuse, and lack of a supervised setting. Therefore, considering the possible influence of these and other factors, the causal relation between ayahuasca/DMT and these cases is not always clear. These data suggest that performance of a psychiatric and drug use history before ayahuasca or DMT administration in controlled settings may reduce the occurrence of psychotic experiences. Regarding noncontrolled/recreational use, individuals with personal or family history of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders, psychotic depression or mania, or with ongoing manic or psychotic symptomatology, should avoid ayahuasca/DMT intake", "tokens": [{"text": "ayahuasca", "start": 307, "end": 316, "token_start": 57, "token_end": 57, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "cognitive or psychiatric problems", "start": 352, "end": 385, "token_start": 63, "token_end": 66, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "ayahuasca", "start": 207, "end": 216, "token_start": 40, "token_end": 40, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "good safety profile", "start": 260, "end": 279, "token_start": 47, "token_end": 49, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "ayahuasca", "start": 2100, "end": 2109, "token_start": 368, "token_end": 368, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "psychotic episodes", "start": 2065, "end": 2083, "token_start": 364, "token_end": 365, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "DMT", "start": 2110, "end": 2113, "token_start": 370, "token_end": 370, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "psychiatric and drug use history", "start": 2522, "end": 2554, "token_start": 440, "token_end": 444, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "psychotic experiences", "start": 2646, "end": 2667, "token_start": 458, "token_end": 459, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "ayahuasca", "start": 553, "end": 562, "token_start": 96, "token_end": 96, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "psychosis", "start": 647, "end": 656, "token_start": 112, "token_end": 112, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "nonpsychotic bipolar disorder", "start": 660, "end": 689, "token_start": 114, "token_end": 116, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "DMT", "start": 566, "end": 569, "token_start": 98, "token_end": 98, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "adverse effects", "start": 1150, "end": 1165, "token_start": 198, "token_end": 199, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "hallucinogens", "start": 1169, "end": 1182, "token_start": 201, "token_end": 201, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "ayahuasca", "start": 2898, "end": 2907, "token_start": 494, "token_end": 494, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "schizophrenia", "start": 2758, "end": 2771, "token_start": 474, "token_end": 474, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "schizophreniform disorders", "start": 2775, "end": 2801, "token_start": 476, "token_end": 477, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "psychotic depression", "start": 2803, "end": 2823, "token_start": 479, "token_end": 480, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "mania", "start": 2827, "end": 2832, "token_start": 482, "token_end": 482, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "manic or psychotic symptomatology", "start": 2850, "end": 2883, "token_start": 487, "token_end": 490, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "DMT", "start": 2908, "end": 2911, "token_start": 496, "token_end": 496, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}], "relations": [{"child": 63, "head": 57, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 47, "head": 40, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 364, "head": 368, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 364, "head": 370, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 458, "head": 440, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 112, "head": 96, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 114, "head": 96, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 112, "head": 98, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 114, "head": 98, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 201, "head": 198, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 474, "head": 494, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 476, "head": 494, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 479, "head": 494, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 482, "head": 494, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 487, "head": 494, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 474, "head": 496, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 476, "head": 496, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 479, "head": 496, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 482, "head": 496, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 487, "head": 496, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_14_2021-12-29_13:17:04.9.txt", "document": "The Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) as validated in this report may serve as a valuable tool for characterizing psychologically difficult aspects of experiences occasioned by psilocybin and, very likely, by other classic hallucinogens.

First, we show that LSD induces widespread alterations of GBC in cortical and subcortical brain areas, characterized by a synchronization of sensory and somatomotor functional networks and dis-integration of associative networks. we show that this effect is sensitive to GSR, which has important implications for future pharmacological resting-state studies. Second, we investigated the receptor-pharmacology of LSD, showing that the 5-HT2A receptor plays a critical role in subjective and neuronal LSD-induced effects. However, analyzing the time course of LSD-induced alterations in functional connectivity, it seems likely that at a later phase, modulation by receptors other than the 5-HT2A receptor is involved. The comparison of LSD-induced effects on functional connectivity and receptor-gene expression maps underscores the interpretations of 5-HT2A pharmacology and points to potentially impactful studies on 5-HT7 receptor pharmacology. Lastly, in line with various theories of consciousness we showed that the somatomotor system in particular is related to LSD-induced psychedelic effects.

We postulate that the state induced by ayahuasca could be useful in the treatment of trauma, substance use disorders, impulsive-related disorders, and certain patients suffering from borderline personality disorder More research is warranted in clinical populations, using larger samples, matched comparison groups, randomized designs and blinded raters to confirm More research efficacy.

There is little evidence linking psychedelic use to lasting mental health problems. In general, use of psychedelics does not appear to be particularly dangerous when compared to other activities considered to have acceptable safety. It is important to take a statistical perspective to risk, rather than focusing on case reports and anecdotes: ‘Nothing in life is free from risk – risk is simply impossible to avoid… Even ordinary activities – eating breakfast, watching television, walking the dog – carry risks, however minor’ (BMA, 2012). As Steven Pinker recently noted, ‘In a free society, one cannot empower the government to outlaw any behavior that offends someone just because the offendee can pull a hypothetical future injury out of the air’ (Pinker, 2008).

Included studies also show a high degree of heterogeneity, and three of the selected citations did not include placebo or a control group (open-label, proof-of-concept studies). Another important limitation is the difficulty in disentangling placebo effects, drug effects, and the influence of the psychological intervention included in the clinical trial However, despite these important limitations, results consistently showed that ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD produced anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects in patients, and these results were also observed in animal studies and with healthy volunteers. Given the low success rates of current pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for drug dependence and anxiety and mood disorders, and considering the high morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders, it is necessary to perform more studies with these drugs, even if only a small portion of patients may reduce patients suffering with these drugs. Future studies should include more patients, placebo or active placebo, randomized and double-blind designs, and multiple doses during treatment. Moreover, the influence of psychological interventions and the possible increases in therapeutic efficacy proportionated by these psychotherapeutic approaches should be better explored Currently available pharmacological treatments for drug dependence and anxiety and mood disorders have limited efficacy and often produce important adverse reactions that may limit treatment continuation. Classic tryptamine hallucinogens such as ayahuasca/DMT, psilocybin, and LSD are safely administered in controlled settings and several basic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that these drugs have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects. Such beneficial properties seem to be mediated by an agonist action of these compounds on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors, which are involved in emotional processing, regulation of neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory actions, and modulation of frontal and medial brain structures. Other mechanisms of action not related to serotonergic receptors, such as regulation of cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxidative stress, also appear to mediate these therapeutic effects The reviewed studies suggest that the therapeutic use of classic hallucinogens may offer to some patients fast-acting and prolonged beneficial effects after a single dose, producing few adverse effects. Indeed, interest in the medicinal uses of this class of drugs is increasing: new clinical trials investigating the effects of psilocybin in the treatment of alcoholism, cocaine dependence, tobacco dependence, and anxiety and depression associated with cancer are currently underway [ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02061293, NCT02037126, NCT01943994, NCT00957359, NCT00465595]. Moreover, our group recently replicated the results of the original open-label, proof-of-concept study [Osório et al. 2015] but including an increased sample size (n =17) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), showing that ayahuasca antidepressive properties may be associated with increased blood perfusion in brain areas related to depressive symptoms (Sanches et al. 2016 “This reference was not included in the review because This reference was not published at the time of the electronic search”). Our group is currently performing randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the antidepressive and anxiolytic potentials of ayahuasca [Frood, 2015] Further studies are urgently

development of psychedelics, and particularly psilocybin, for medical use is a major point of convergence. There may be a subtle difference in Our views of the so-called ‘mystical’ elements of the psychedelic experience, ie, both of us see the term ‘mystical’ as problematic—but whereas GMG views the acute ‘psychedelic experience’ as irrelevant to the clinical development of psychedelics, RLC-H sees RLC-H as a potentially exploitable component—especially as RLC-H has been shown to be predictive of long-term clinical outcomes (eg, in Johnson et al, 2014; Bogenschutz et al, 2015; Griffiths et al, 2016; Ross et al, 2016; Carhart-Harris et al, 2016a, b). Perhaps the most notable point of divergence, however, relates to the choice of patient population for the clinical development of psilocybin for depression. For GMG, the most obvious and relevant unmet need is treatment-resistant depression (see below), and while RLC-H accepts that treatment resistance is often the first port-of-call for the development of a novel intervention, RLC-H accepts that treatment resistance is often the first port-of-call for the development of a novel intervention feels that unipolar depression more generally, will prove a better indication for this treatment. In RLC-H accepts that treatment resistance is often the first port-of-call for the development of a novel intervention view, psilocybin will be safest, most effective, and easiest to implement, prior to the treatment-resistant stage of illness Focusing on treatment-resistant depression for the moment, however, we both recognize that a significant number of patients treated first line with either a SSRI or CBT fail to respond adequately (Gaynes, 2009). Persisting symptoms lead to enduring chronicity of depression, and there is no consensus in existing guidelines on what to do next. Moreover, the efficacy of secondary intervention is often modest and new medications can introduce new side effects. The duration of distress with TRD and its economic impact are considerable. We agree that TRD represents a valid point in the treatment pathway, where a single psychedelic intervention might find a place; however, RLC-H questions whether patients must wait until patients depression is significantly stamped-in before psilocybin can be considered, and based on the speed and duration of treatment responses seen in the trials listed above, it seems reasonable to ask whether early intervention with psilocybin could be prophylactic—and there is also the issue of SSRIs obstructing the potential therapeutic action of psilocybin If it is to be TRD, however, then patient recruitment can be based on pre-existing criteria (Sackeim, 2001) and patients meeting patients will not be rare and should not be excessively treatment resistant. As noted earlier, there is a significant challenge to the issue of continuing medication, most commonly with SSRIs. There is anecdotal evidence that psychedelic effects are largely attenuated by ongoing treatment with SSRIs (Bonson et al, 1996) and perhaps with other antidepressants (Bonson and Murphy, 1996). Downregulation of 5-HT2A receptors is a feature of many different first-line antidepressant drugs (Muguruza et al, 2014), as well as second-line antidepressant medications (eg, atypical antipsychotics) with significant 5-HT2AR antagonist properties (Gray and Roth, 2001). Any trial would ideally be conducted in patients withdrawn from such drugs for at least 2 weeks or so, but we accept that this is not always straightforward Moving on from questions of the optimal patient population, both of us can see merit in a multiple dose trial comparing, for example, 1, 10 and 25 mg of psilocybin. Such a design seems to overcome some of the problems any trial of a psychedelic will face. The ethical problem of equipoise seems satisfactory because we really do not know which dose, if any, will be effective, and patients can enter the study knowing that whatever group patients are allocated to, patients will receive active drug. The omission of a strict placebo control would be pragmatic in this sense, as expectation and preparation would be standardized. We know the highest dose of psilocybin will likely unblind participants and the expectation of a possible placebo would complicate recruitment. An approximation to an inert placebo condition may be met with the 1 mg psilocybin arm, as such a dose is likely too low to produce appreciable subjective or physiological effects (Griffiths et al, 2016). The differences between a dose mainly producing perceptual distortion (10 mg) and one more capable of producing the more profound, putatively ‘transformative’ aspects of the psychedelic experience (25 mg) is also of scientific and clinical interest Comparing mechanisms and/or efficacy with an established treatment would be a next step to advance the evidence base for psilocybin for TRD. For example, psilocybin could be compared with ketamine since it has some similarities: rapid, single-dose efficacy, and obvious subjective effects during it infusion. Psilocybin’s distinctive subjective effects and the implications of this for blinding would still remain a major challenge; moreover, as with ketamine, there will also remain the question of how much an acute response is sustained and whether a maintenance dose may be required The traditional view of the mechanism, whereby psilocybin works, emphasizes the importance of accompanying psychotherapy (Johnson et al, 2008; Richards, 2015). Accordingly, psychedelics administered without psychological support and/or a supportive environment may have limited antidepressant efficacy, and in very rare cases, could even worsen a patient’s condition (Oram, 2014). We share the view that the presence of psychological support is an essential component of the psychedelic treatment model (Johnson et al, 2008) but We also recognize that the magnitude and nature of its contribution needs to be better defined and tested Pragmatically, We accept that minimizing the active psychological work of the therapy would be desirable (eg, therapy time is expensive) and scientifically, doing so would allow drug effects and dose to be better identified. Critically however, any such therapy minimization should not be allowed to jeopardize patient safety (Johnson et al, 2008). A future challenge will be to learn how psychological interventions can maximize the advantages of the psychedelic state. For example, we can imagine how cognitive therapy, attentional-bias training and/or de-sensitization could be investigated with or without psilocybin assistance In other respects, a psilocybin trial is easier to conduct than studies requiring continuing adherence to a daily oral dose of an antidepressant. Exposure to the treatment can be completely controlled and follow-up can be relatively pragmatic. It seems logical to determine an early proximal end point to prove initial impact of treatment and then to follow subsequent illness course as comprehensively as possible. In this way, we will be able to determine time to supplementary treatment, document recovery of symptoms and function, and perhaps objectify improvement using a simple frictionless measure of activity-like geolocation (Palmius et al, 2016) In the short term, there will also be a need to demonstrate cost effectiveness. The requirement for psychological support and/or a supportive environment could be a major limitation of the psychedelic treatment model. However, direct medical costs need to be netted off against the social and economic costs of illness In summary, a door has been opened for the medical repurposing of psychedelics. The possibility exists that drugs like psilocybin can meet a major unmet need in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. For GMG, treatment-resistant depression is the most logical place to start because of the uncertainty around the choice of next-step treatment after an SSRI fails, and while RLC-H accepts this (Carhart-Harris et al, 2016a, b), RLC-H accepts this (Carhart-Harris et al, 2016a, b) looks forward to a time when an individual may receive psilocybin before the ruts of depression are allowed to deepen (Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011). Regardless of who the ‘right’ patient population might be eventually, a key challenge now is to design the optimal trial to demonstrate efficacy, agree a key challenge validity with regulatory authorities and fund a key challenge.", "tokens": [{"text": "SSRIs", "start": 3038, "end": 3043, "token_start": 571, "token_end": 571, "entityLabel": "ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG"}, {"text": "psychedelic

unresolved problem in neuropsychopharmacology, namely what is the function of brain serotonin? This paper proposes that the principal function of brain serotonin is to enhance adaptive responses to adverse conditions via two distinct pathways: (1) a passive coping pathway which improves stress tolerability; and (2) an active coping pathway associated with heightened plasticity, which, with support, can improve an organism’s ability to identify and overcome source(s) of stress by changing outlook and/or behaviour. Crucially, we propose that these two functions are mediated by signalling at postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors respectively, with 5-HT1AR signalling dominating under ordinary conditions but 5-HT2AR signalling becoming increasingly operative as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We suggest that the two functions of interest (5-HT1AR-mediated stress relief and 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity) are sufficiently distinct – and may even be mutually oppositional in certain contexts (see also Azmitia, 2001), evoking dilemmas over whether it is better to passively endure or actively approach, and in so doing, initiate some sort of fundamental change – with the potential for major resolution. This rule may not be absolute however, and the two functions may also be complementary, e.g. in the case of enhanced serotonin functioning with chronic SSRI use – or indeed with normal basal 5-HT functioning, facilitating improved endurance and plasticity (Clarke et al., 2004, 2007; Mithoefer et al., 2011, 2016; van Apeldoorn et al., 2008) Despite this complementarity, we do anticipate that conventional serotonergic antidepressants such as the SSRIs and classic psychedelics such as psilocybin may become competitive options for the treatments of certain disorders such as depression; most fundamentally because conventional serotonergic antidepressants such as the SSRIs and classic psychedelics such as psilocybin may become competitive options for the treatments of certain disorders such as depression work via distinct pathways (i.e. 5-HT1AR versus the 5-HT2AR signalling) – but also because conventional serotonergic antidepressants such as the SSRIs and classic psychedelics such as psilocybin may become competitive options for the treatments of certain disorders such as depression cannot easily be taken in combination, i.e. conventional antidepressants attenuate the characteristic psychological effects of psychedelics (Bonson et al., 1996; Bonson and Murphy, 1996). SSRIs are established evidence-based treatments for anxiety and major depression (Baldwin et al., 2016; Hieronymus et al., 2016), whereas psychedelics are experimental medicines in an early phase of development (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). However, if evidence supporting the therapeutic value of psychedelics accrues – as we anticipate, and it is increasingly shown that Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) therapeutic mechanisms are significantly distinct from those of conventional medications, then this will open-up new and potentially empowering options for patients and clinicians (as well as a real potential for resistance – however it may arise). For the brave new psychiatry of the future – that many would like to see (Miller, 2010) – decisions about whether to passively endure or actively address, may become increasingly pertinent.", "tokens": [{"text": "brain serotonin", "start": 187, "end": 202, "token_start": 30, "token_end": 31, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "adaptive responses to adverse conditions", "start": 217, "end": 257, "token_start": 35, "token_end": 39, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "stress tolerability", "start": 329, "end": 348, "token_start": 54, "token_end": 55, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "heightened plasticity", "start": 399, "end": 420, "token_start": 67, "token_end": 68, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "organism’s ability to identify and overcome source(s) of stress", "start": 458, "end": 521, "token_start": 78, "token_end": 88, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "changing outlook and/or behaviour", "start": 525, "end": 558, "token_start": 90, "token_end": 93, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "5-HT1AR-mediated stress relief", "start": 907, "end": 937, "token_start": 155, "token_end": 161, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "fundamental change – with the potential for major resolution", "start": 1207, "end": 1267, "token_start": 214, "token_end": 222, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity", "start": 942, "end": 969, "token_start": 163, "token_end": 168, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "SSRI", "start": 1421, "end": 1425, "token_start": 251, "token_end": 251, "entityLabel": "ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG"}, {"text": "enhanced serotonin functioning", "start": 1377, "end": 1407, "token_start": 246, "token_end": 248, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "antidepressants", "start": 2421, "end": 2436, "token_start": 416, "token_end": 416, "entityLabel": "ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG"}, {"text": "attenuate the characteristic psychological effects of psychedelics", "start": 2437, "end": 2503, "token_start": 417, "token_end": 423, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "SSRIs", "start": 2552, "end": 2557, "token_start": 439, "token_end": 439, "entityLabel": "ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG"}, {"text": "anxiety", "start": 2604, "end": 2611, "token_start": 447, "token_end": 447, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "major depression", "start": 2616, "end": 2632, "token_start": 449, "token_end": 450, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "psychedelics", "start": 2885, "end": 2897, "token_start": 506, "token_end": 506, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "therapeutic mechanisms", "start": 2989, "end": 3011, "token_start": 528, "token_end": 529, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}], "relations": [{"child": 35, "head": 30, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 54, "head": 30, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 67, "head": 30, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 78, "head": 30, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 78, "head": 90, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 214, "head": 155, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 214, "head": 163, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 246, "head": 251, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 417, "head": 416, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 447, "head": 439, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 449, "head": 439, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 528, "head": 506, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_4_2021-12-29_13:17:04.5.txt", "document": "This article has argued that scientific research with psychedelic drugs can have a revitalizing effect on psychoanalysis and an informing influence on mainstream psychology and psychiatry. Rather than discuss the content and interpretation of psychoanalytically-relevant material, we have adopted a mechanistic approach, in keeping with the mainstream cognitive neuroscience. This article proposes that a distinction can be made between two fundamentally different modes of cognition: primary and secondary consciousness. Primary consciousness is associated with unconstrained cognition and less ordered (higher-entropy) neurodynamics, whereas secondary consciousness is associated with constrained cognition and more ordered neurodynamics (i.e., that strikes an evolutionarily advantageous balance between order and disorder - that may or more not be perfectly “critical”). It is hoped that this mechanistic model will help catalyze a synthesis between psychoanalytic theory and cognitive neuroscience that can be mutually beneficial to both disciplines. It is a fair criticism of this paper that this paper has given insufficient consideration to the phenomenological content of the relevant altered states of consciousness, and to the specifics of Freudian theory, and so by neglecting this, has failed to present a sufficiently compelling case that these states have anything to do with psychoanalytic theory. To some extent, this charge can be conceded; however, as outlined in the introduction, the intention of this paper was to develop a mechanistic account of altered states of consciousness based on the quantity of entropy, and this task has demanded a substantial amount of space. A more thorough discussion of the phenomenology of primary states is required to develop the case that primary states show characteristics that are consistent with Freudian accounts of “the unconscious” or “Id.” The reader should be made aware however, that this has been attempted before (Carhart-Harris, 2007; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). To conclude, it is perhaps not surprising that with only dreaming and psychosis at it disposal, psychoanalysis has failed to convince the scientific community that the psychoanalytic unconscious exists (Hassin et al., 2005). From a neuroscientific perspective, dreaming and psychosis are notoriously difficult to study. The occurrence of dreaming in sleep impedes experimental control and psychosis is an especially complex and variegated phenomenon. However, for those brave enough to embrace it, research with psychedelics could herald the beginning of a new scientifically informed-psychoanalysis that has the potential to influence modern psychology and psychiatry. The unique scientific value of psychedelics rests in their capacity to make consciously accessible that which is latent in the mind. This paper takes the position that mainstream psychology and psychiatry have underappreciated the depth of the human mind by neglecting schools of thought that posit the existence an unconscious mind. Indeed, psychedelics' greatest value may be as a remedy for ignorance of the unconscious mind.", "tokens": [{"text": "psychedelic drugs", "start": 54, "end": 71, "token_start": 8, "token_end": 9, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "revitalizing effect on psychoanalysis", "start": 83, "end": 120, "token_start": 13, "token_end": 16, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "influence on mainstream psychology and psychiatry", "start": 138, "end": 187, "token_start": 20, "token_end": 25, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "Primary consciousness", "start": 522, "end": 543, "token_start": 77, "token_end": 78, "entityLabel": "SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE"}, {"text": "unconstrained cognition and less ordered (higher-entropy) neurodynamics", "start": 563, "end": 634, "token_start": 82, "token_end": 92, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "secondary consciousness", "start": 644, "end": 667, "token_start": 95, "token_end": 96, "entityLabel": "SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE"}, {"text": "constrained cognition and more ordered neurodynamics", "start": 687, "end": 739, "token_start": 100, "token_end": 105, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "phenomenology of primary states", "start": 1727, "end": 1758, "token_start": 277, "token_end": 280, "entityLabel": "SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE"}, {"text": "characteristics that are consistent with Freudian accounts of “the unconscious” or “Id.", "start": 1816, "end": 1903, "token_start": 291, "token_end": 305, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psychedelics", "start": 2552, "end": 2564, "token_start": 422, "token_end": 422, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "influence modern psychology and psychiatry", "start": 2666, "end": 2708, "token_start": 439, "token_end": 443, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psychedelics", "start": 2741, "end": 2753, "token_start": 450, "token_end": 450, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "capacity to make consciously accessible that which is latent in the mind", "start": 2769, "end": 2841, "token_start": 454, "token_end": 465, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "human mind", "start": 2954, "end": 2964, "token_start": 483, "token_end": 484, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "unconscious mind", "start": 3026, "end": 3042, "token_start": 495, "token_end": 496, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "psychedelics", "start": 3052, "end": 3064, "token_start": 500, "token_end": 500, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "remedy for ignorance of the unconscious mind", "start": 3093, "end": 3137, "token_start": 508, "token_end": 514, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}], "relations": [{"child": 13, "head": 8, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 20, "head": 8, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 82, "head": 77, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 100, "head": 95, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 291, "head": 277, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 439, "head": 422, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 454, "head": 450, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 495, "head": 483, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 508, "head": 500, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_3_2021-12-29_13:17:04.5.txt", "document": "In conclusion, single moderate-dose psilocybin (in conjunction with psychotherapy) was safely administered to a cohort of patients with cancer-related psychological distress (e.g. anxiety, depression).
