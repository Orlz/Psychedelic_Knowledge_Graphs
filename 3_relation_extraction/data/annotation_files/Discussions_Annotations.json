Thus, as far as modern science is able to determine, rats do not have a sense of self and are incapable of having existential anxiety, pondering the meaning behind rats own existence or fearing a reality in which rats, as individuals, do not exist. No one knows what the subjective experience of a rat is after being given a psychedelic, but a rat is highly unlikely that they are able to place that within the context of they life experiences and utilize that knowledge therapeutically to improve they affective state. Therefore, because psilocybin has robust effects similar to those of other antidepressants in rats that is very long lasting, which is similar to the long lasting antidepressant effects of psilocybin to alleviate the symptoms of depression in humans, we posit that the basis for the antidepressant effects in humans is at the antidepressant effects in humans core biological in nature, and that while correlated to antidepressant effect (27) peak ego dissolution subjective experiences following psilocybin administration is not causational to antidepressant effect. These biological processes could include cellular proliferation, increased synaptic connectivity, and anti-inflammatory effects. Drugs like LSD and psilocybin have been demonstrated to elicit these types of changes in preclinical models, and these types of physiological effects have each been associated with antidepressant-like behavioral outcomes. (32,36) Although we propose that the antidepressant-like effects are primarily rooted in biological processes, our data suggest that post drug administration environmental factors also play a critical role in overall drug effects. Our results suggest that psilocybin facilitates a period of behavioral flexibility in which exploration of a non-home-cage environment reduces their anxiety during future exploration of a novel environment (the EPM, Figure 3A), but FST evaluation 1 week after psilocybin blunts the antidepressant-like effect in the FST (Figure 2A,F,G). In this context, psilocybin may open a window during which time certain experiences are salient to the development of new coping strategies, similar to MDMA-facilitated social learning reported in mice. (37) As the FST measures the coping strategies of rodents challenged with the threat of drowning, successfully surviving the first trial by floating may make rats given psilocybin more likely to use this coping strategy in the future, whereas rats given psilocybin and not subjected to FST for 5 weeks choose active coping strategies. Interestingly, that is not true of ketamine, as ketamine’s antidepressant-like effect was independent of repeated FST, but transient (Figure 2D,G) and no anxiolytic effect was observed (Figure 3C). Therefore, overall efficacy in humans is likely a combination of both the acute neurological effects of the drug and subjective, contextual experiences during and/or immediately following the drug administration session", "tokens": [{"text": "subjective experience", "start": 489, "end": 510, "token_start": 101, "token_end": 102, "entityLabel": "SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE"}, {"text": "psychedelic",

very low “microdose” of LSD (13 μg) on resting state connectivity in healthy human volunteers. we found that LSD increased amygdala seed-based connectivity with the right angular gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and the cerebellum, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the left and right postcentral gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. Although the drug’s effects on mood were small and variable, the increase in amygdala – middle frontal gyrus connectivity strength was positively correlated with positive mood after the drug. No changes in CBF were recorded. Despite the growing popularity of the practice of microdosing in the community and handful of studies investigating the subjective and behavioral effects of microdoses of LSD, to we knowledge this the first study to investigate the effects of a very low dose of the drug on resting state connectivity and CBF Our results are in line with previous studies investigating changes in amygdala responses under the influence of higher doses of LSD and other psychedelics, including psilocybin. The amygdala receives inputs from all manner of sensory information-focused areas and prefrontal cortex, and the latter is also a target of amygdala afferents, making the interpretation of results involving amygdala connectivity a complex process. Nonetheless, our study is consistent with prior work showing reduced amygdala system modulation. Using a much higher dose of LSD (100 μg compared to 13 μg) Mueller (15) reported dampened amygdala responses to fearful facial expressions and Kraehenmann (13) found similar results with the serotonergic drug psilocybin. Grimm (18) found that psilocybin not only modulated amygdala activation, but also decreased amygdala connectivity to the frontal pole during the viewing of happy faces, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the striatum during the viewing of angry faces. Though Grimm (18) investigated task-based connectivity and our study investigated resting-state connectivity, our result that LSD decreases connectivity between the amygdala and the superior temporal gyrus, a region shown to be involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli (30), is of interest in light of these previous findings. Notably, however, the previous studies used substantially higher doses of the drugs, and the previous studies is of particular interest that we detected these changes in neural function at doses of LSD that produce minimal direct subjective or behavioral effects and do not alter CBF Amygdala hyperreactivity has been associated with a host of psychiatric disorders involving negative processing bias, including major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders (31, 32). Further, standard antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) act acutely to dampen, and thereby normalize, disrupted amygdala responses, which may be a mechanism underlying standard antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) efficacy (33, 34). The extent to which microdoses of LSD or other serotonin agonists dampen amygdala activity and connectivity, after either acute or repeated dosing, and how these are related to mood symptoms remain an important direction for future research Interestingly, we also observed increased connectivity between the amygdala and middle frontal gyrus, right angular gyrus, and cerebellum. Beyond dampening amygdala responses to negative stimuli, negative stimuli has been suggested that SSRIs may act by enhancing cortico-limbic connectivity in the brain, thereby facilitating appropriate emotion regulation (35). In line with these findings, in our study, changes in amygdala-middle frontal gyrus connectivity were significantly correlated with changes in positive mood. Furthermore, reduced connectivity between the right amygdala and the cerebellum has been reported in depressed patients (36). These alterations in connectivity have been suggested to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression given that dysfunctions in cerebellar-limbic circuits have been shown to disrupt emotional processing (36, 37). In a future study it will be important to determine whether small doses of LSD normalize decreased amygdala-cerebellar connectivity in depressed patients In contrast to LSD-induced changes in amygdala connectivity, we did not find alterations in thalamo-cortical connectivity. This is not surprising given that altered information processing in thalamo-cortical loops has been suggested to underlie the psychedelic-induced altered state of consciousness (9). The “microdose” used in this study did not induce psychedelic symptoms or an altered state of consciousness and may therefore not influence these pathways, but rather change information processing in emotional networks Our study design had several limitations. First, Our study included only healthy volunteers, and the effects of the drug on mood or brain function may be different in individuals with symptoms of depression or anxiety. Second, Our investigated effects of only a single administration of LSD, whereas individuals who “microdose” the drug in real-world settings report using the drug repeatedly, every 3 or 4 days. Whether drug produces different effects on brain activity or mood after repeated doses remains to be determined. Another limitation is that we did not examine subjects’ responses to behavioral tasks implicated in mood-enhancing effects of drugs such as tasks assessing cognitive and emotion processing. Finally, perhaps because of the low dose, the effects of the drug were subtle. For example, we detected correlations between mood and connectivity in both the placebo and drug conditions. The specificity of the effect to the drug condition will await further study with additional subjects and repeated dosing In summary, here we report the results of the first study to investigate the effects of a very low, “microdose” of LSD on resting state functional connectivity in a sample of healthy human volunteers. We describe changes in amygdala connectivity in brain regions that are implicated in depression. It remains to be determined with repeated doses of this low-dose drug result in antidepressant effects. These promising findings provide a good basis for pursuing the efficacy of low doses of serotonin agonists in psychiatric treatment", "tokens": [{"text": "LSD", "start": 151, "end": 154,

"coreferenced_full_texts_83_2021-12-28_12:51:41.1.txt", "document": "The present study demonstrates the first attempt to assess the acute effects of psilocybin on glutamate levels in key areas of the human brain, which may play a major role in the actions of serotonergic psychedelics. Using an ultra-high field multimodal MRI approach, we demonstrated that, compared with placebo, psilocybin-induced region-dependent alterations in neurometabolite concentrations. Specifically, participants who received psilocybin demonstrated higher relative glutamate concentration levels in the mPFC, and lower relative glutamate concentration levels in the hippocampus. Analyses indicated that region-dependent alterations in glutamate were also correlated with different dimensions of ego dissolution. Whereas changes in mPFC glutamate were found to be the strongest predictor of negatively experienced ego dissolution, changes in hippocampal glutamate were found to be the strongest predictor of positively experienced ego dissolution Previous studies have demonstrated that the mPFC is highly enriched with 5-HT2A receptors located primarily on layer V pyramidal neurons [61], and modulate excitatory transmission in cortical circuits [43, 62, 63]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of such receptors via serotonergic psychedelics results in a predominantly excitatory response [18, 64] via an increase in glutamate release, as observed in humans for the first time in this study. A glutamatergic increase in this area is also in accordance with human functional imaging studies which have demonstrated a hyperfrontal regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) pattern after psilocybin [46, 65], and similar 5-HT2A agonist psychedelics [66, 67] However, we also found that psilocybin administration was associated with higher levels of GABA in this area, results in line with findings that 5-HT2A receptors are also located on GABAergic interneurons [17, 68]. Taken together, findings suggest that activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the mPFC results in both excitation and inhibition of cortical pyramidal cells [17], potentially resulting in an increased metabolic rate in this area, but not necessarily increased neural input or output In contrast to the mPFC, the present study demonstrated that participants who received psilocybin demonstrated lower relative glutamate concentrations in the hippocampus, suggesting that psilocybin decreases glutamate in this area. Such a decrease is in line with data from a recent functional imaging study with psilocybin, demonstrating reduced absolute CBF in the hippocampus compared with placebo [69], of which the authors proposed two potential mechanisms. Namely, decrements could be due to agonism of 5-HT2A receptors located on GABAergic interneurons [44], which can indirectly inhibit pyramidal neurons, decreasing activation in this area. Conversely, agonism of 5-HT2A receptors located on GABAergic interneurons [44], which can indirectly inhibit pyramidal neurons, decreasing activation in this area has also been established that, along with the 5-HT2A receptor, psilocin also has a high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor [70, 71]. Referred to as serotonin’s principal inhibitory receptor [72], the 5-HT1A receptors highest density is found in the limbic regions of the brain such as the hippocampus [73] where the 5-HT1A receptors highest density is expressed on neurons that are postsynaptic to the serotonergic input. Thus lower levels in glutamate as seen in this study, as well as regional decreases reflected in others [69], could be due to activation of postsynaptic inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors Nevertheless, due to methodological limitations, this study is not able to delineate which mechanism is contributing to the lower levels in glutamate. Further information could have been potentially gained from quantification of GABA in the hippocampus, however we were unable to reliably do so, due to inherent quantification challenges when assessing GABA levels, arising from low brain concentration levels, metabolite signal overlap, and low signal-to-noise in the hippocampus [74, 75]. Future studies with sequences developed to specifically quantify GABA in low signal-to-noise areas should make further attempts to do so, given recent research implicating hippocampal GABA in the pathology of disorders that psychedelics are being investigated to treat [76] In the current study, psilocybin induced previously established key features of a psychedelic experience: increases in feelings of ego dissolution, and disrupted RSN activity. Psilocybin increased scores on all dimensions of the 5D-ASC [16], as well as on the EDI [1]. In addition, psilocybin altered within-network FC similarly as has been shown with LSD, including decrements in coactivation within the DMN, visual network 1, and the auditory network [32, 33]. Finally, we demonstrated higher between-network FC across all networks, which is similar with previous studies assessing the same after psilocybin [35, 42] and LSD Finally, we assessed the relationship between psilocybin-induced changes in the brain, and the subjective experience of sense of self. Canonical correlations were conducted to predict increases in ratings of AED, the dimension encompassing the loss of autonomy and self-control of thought processes, intentionality, decision making, and spontaneous movements [46]. Our data support the conclusion that increasing levels of mPFC glutamate were the strongest predictor in regards to feelings of AED, with decreasing anterior DMN FC and hippocampal glutamate being secondary predictors. These findings are in line with previous work, implicating increased frontal metabolism in feelings of AED after psilocybin [46] and ego pathology in the ketamine model of psychosis [77]. Interestingly, AED-associated changes in mood include paranoia, heightened arousal and attention to the surroundings, and anxiety [46]. A paradoxical effect of serotonergic psychedelics is that acutely they have been found to increase feelings of anxiety [6, 78], whereas clinical trials with psychedelic drugs suggest long-term anxiety relief in patients [11, 12, 14]. Accordingly, there is a wide range of animal and human pharmacological evidence supporting the role of the glutamatergic system in anxiety [79], with increases in glutamate in the frontal cortex associated with high versus low state-trait anxiety [80], and reductions corresponding to anxiety-related symptomatic relief [81]. Taken together, the finding that mPFC glutamate was by far the strongest predictor of increased feelings of anxiety, one could propose that acute psychedelic-induced anxiety may be due to localized glutamate-induced hyperfrontality, whereas long-term reductions could be due to agonist-induced 5-HT2A receptor downregulation in this area [72, 82]. Nonetheless, future studies should assess long-term changes in 5-HT2A receptor function in the mPFC, and future studies relation with subjective effects We also assessed the relationship between psilocybin-induced brain changes and feelings of positively experienced ego dissolution, including ratings on the EDI, and scores of OB on the 5D-ASC. We found that the primary predictor of positively experienced ego dissolution was a decrement in hippocampal glutamate, with secondary contributions of mPFC glutamate and posterior DMN integrity. Previous work has implicated both the MTL (containing the hippocampus) and DMN circuitry in the neural correlates of the self [49]. Namely, abnormal function of MTL regions have been implicated in psychotic states [83, 84] and feelings of depersonalization [85] and ego-disturbances [86]. Similarly, studies of drug-induced ego dissolution have found that the decoupling of MTL regions such as the parahippocampus and the DMN correlate positively with feelings of ego dissolution [49, 87], with this decoupling being hypothesized to be one of the main underlying mechanisms of the subjective experience [47,48,49]. In regards to why this gives rise to ego dissolution, this has been suggested that psychedelic drug-induced decoupling of these regions results in a temporary loss of access of semantic autobiographical information, resulting in a breakdown of one’s personal identity [87]. Our data add to this hypothesis, suggesting that modulations of hippocampal glutamate in particular may be a key mediator in the decoupling underlying feelings of (positive) ego dissolution. Interestingly, although the DMN has been the most implicated RSN in this process, Lebedev et al. [49] found that increases in ego dissolution correlated with decreased FC between the parahippocampal formation and other major networks, such as the salience, frontoparietal, and sensorimotor network; suggesting a key role in this area in particular, as our data also demonstrate. However future research should further assess the contribution of other areas to this experience, such as the posterior cingulate cortex Implications of these findings also extend far beyond understanding the neurobiology of the acute psychedelic experience and drug-induced ego dissolution. There is growing evidence that psychedelics can provide therapeutic relief for individuals suffering from increasingly common and difficult to treat disorders such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorders [4, 9, 11, 88, 89]. Thus understanding the mechanisms by which psychedelics provide symptomatic relief may identify novel therapeutic targets. Interestingly, the degree of ego dissolution has been found to correlate with long-term clinical outcomes [90] and increases in well-being [10, 91]. In addition, a hypothetical (neurobiological) model has been proposed to explain the long-term effects witnessed in clinical trials. the long-term effects witnessed in clinical trials has been suggested that indirect activation of glutamate networks via 5-HT2A receptor agonism increases BDNF, and ultimately enhances neuroplasticity [16]. In line with this, the long-term effects witnessed in clinical trials has been shown in preclinical models that psychedelics increase functional and structural neuroplasticity [92], however evidence in humans is limited, due to restrictions of methodological techniques. Our data provide indirect evidence that psychedelics might have the potential to increase neuroplasticity in the human cortex via increased glutamatergic activity, but not in the hippocampus; findings that are in accordance with previous 5-HT2A receptor activation studies [27, 93, 94]. In addition, psilocybin administration was associated with higher levels of mPFC NAA, a compound regarded as a measure of neuronal viability and function, and decreased in disorders associated with regional neuronal loss and disrupted neuronal function Of note, compared to previous psychedelic studies, the dose administered was low to moderate [96], and thus not high enough to induce total ego dissolution. However, the aim of this study was not to assess maximal effects of psilocybin, but rather an effective dose that would induce a relevant psychedelic state that participants could endure in the MRI scanner. Our data demonstrate that the dose was effective, inducing significantly higher levels of both positively and negatively experienced ego dissolution compared with placebo, as well as the other subjective effects representative of a psychedelic state (Figs. 1, S1). Furthermore, although BOLD sensitivity is increased by the use of ultra-high magnetic fields, geometric distortions become more prominent, which could have affected our BOLD signal in inferior brain regions [97], and our scan time was arguably short from a test–retest reliability standpoint [98]. Nevertheless, our results are similar to aforementioned studies [32, 33, 35, 42] who acquired our results data at a lower field strength, with varying scanning lengths. Finally, an inherent difficulty of studying substances with such salient subjective effects is maintaining the treatment blind. Thus, it could be suggested that participant recognition of the treatment condition could affect neural and subjective results, emphasizing the importance of active placebo conditions or cross-psychotropic comparisons in future trials In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the serotonergic psychedelic, psilocybin, acutely induces region dependent alterations in glutamate that correlate with established behavioral changes during the psychedelic state. Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic state, and importantly, provide a neurochemical basis for how these substances alter individuals’ sense of self, and may be giving rise to therapeutic effects witnessed in ongoing clinical trials", "tokens": [{"text": "psilocybin", "start": 313, "end": 323, "token_start": 56,

"Evidence from carefully designed and performed open and controlled trials involving the administration of single or few doses of serotoninergic hallucinogens suggests that these compounds have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties that should be further investigated in controlled trials with larger samples sizes. Importantly, the incidence of severe adverse reactions such as psychotic episodes in these trials is extremely low or nonexistent, which is based on careful screening, preparation of the subject and of the experimental context, and monitoring during drug effects. Furthermore, evidence from observational studies on the physical and mental health of ritual ayahuasca users suggest a low toxicity profile for this practice, and even suggests benefits on mood, anxiety, a substance use disorders In 2018 the investigation of psilocybin as a possible treatment for treatment-resistant MDD received the Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, and similar trials are planned to occur in Europe (Anon., 2018). If these trials show positive results, the carefully controlled use of psilocybin can become available for treating MDD in the US and Europe, which could later expand to the off-label and compassionate use of psilocybin in cancer-related depression and anxiety and maybe in other medical conditions characterized by mood and anxiety symptoms. The therapeutic use of LSD should follow the same steps as those of psilocybin In the case of ayahuasca, indigenous and mestizo communities of the Northwestern Amazon and Brazilian syncretic religions have been using it ritually and therapeutically for generations, and these practices are continuously evolving into new forms and expanding to new territories. If the clinical trials with ayahuasca continue to show positive results, regulatory agencies worldwide (including in Brazil) may be faced with the challenge of regulating a plant-based hallucinogen/psychedelic It should also be considered that a synthetic equivalent of ayahuasca could be developed (for example by combing harmine with DMT), which could bypass the complexities of a plant-based preparation. Chemical changes in the DMT molecule could allow the DMT molecule oral absorption. While the use of synthetic equivalents may be unacceptable to some people involved in the religious ayahuasca practices, it may be a more practical way to have the medicine become approved for use in patients. However, legislations regarding the use of purified DMT are very restrict. Thus, the use of a plant-based preparation that is already allowed in some countries could be the fastest and cheapest way to make the medicine reach the population. Moreover, the ritual users of ayahuasca developed over the generations techniques to use ayahuasca in a safe manner. This could also facilitate the incorporation of ayahuasca as a medicine, at least in countries were these religious groups are present Mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders are among the most important contributors to global disability. Available medications are ineffective for many patients, induce significant adverse reactions, and need weeks of daily intake before therapeutic effects appear. Therefore, new drugs with rapid onset of action and sustained effects after single or few doses could be beneficial for many patients Moreover, although ketamine (which also has hallucinogenic/psychedelic effects and has been recently approved by the FDA to treat MDD) has a rapid onset of action and enduring effects, ketamine (which also has hallucinogenic/psychedelic effects and has been recently approved by the FDA to treat MDD) use may be associated with tolerance, potential for dependence and diversion, and urinary adverse events (Radvansky et al., 2016; CADTH, 2019). None of these problems have been observed in trials with serotoninergic hallucinogen, but long-term studies are lacking. Further clinical trials using different doses of serotoninergic hallucinogens and larger samples are necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of these drugs, as well as naturalistic

study investigated acute effects of LSD using a range of well-defined doses in healthy subjects. Previous recent studies mostly used LSD products that were not developed according to pharmaceutical standards, as discussed elsewhere [20]. Additionally, we determined plasma LSD concentrations as measures of exposure to the substance in the body that are a prerequisite for a valid dose-finding study. We used LSD doses in the psychedelic effect dose range (25–200 µg of LSD base) that were expected to induce full subjective effects of LSD as previously reported by comparable studies that used single-dose levels [4, 10,11,12]. Plasma LSD concentrations increased proportionally with increasing doses and decreased according to first-order elimination. The PK parameters were consistent with single-dose studies [20, 31]. A preliminary report of a longer terminal elimination half-life of LSD [32] was not confirmed in the present study. We found no sex differences in LSD concentrations or effects consistent with previous studies using no body weight adjustment of LSD doses [20, 31, 32] LSD dose-dependently increased subjective effects that were largely similar to previous studies that used single-dose levels [10,11,12,13, 26]. Importantly, a ceiling effect was reached at higher doses of LSD (>100 µg) with regard to higher doses of LSD (>100 µg) positive subjective effects, with no difference in good drug effects between the 100 and 200 µg doses. However, the 200 µg dose of LSD produced significantly greater ego dissolution and anxious ego dissolution than the 100 µg dose. Additionally, only the 200 µg dose and not the 100 µg dose of LSD-induced significant anxiety. However, doses above 100 µg may be used if the goal is to induce the experience of ego dissolution or disembodiment. These experiences, however, were produced at doses that also produced more anxiety compared with lower doses. LSD doses of 100 and 200 µg were both subjectively identified as high doses but could not be subjectively distinguished with certainty from each other. Both of these doses can clearly be considered full psychedelic doses and have previously been investigated in healthy subjects [11, 12]. No previous studies directly compared LSD doses of 100 and 200 µg. In contrast to the present findings, we previously reported moderately greater effects of a 200 µg dose of LSD in one study [12] compared with 100 µg in another study [11]. Specifically, 200 µg LSD produced significantly greater total scores on the 5D-ASC scale, including higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts compared with 100 µg [26]. In a previous study, the 200 µg dose of LSD also produced higher ratings of good drug effects, bad drug effects, fear, open, and trust on the VAS compared with 100 µg [11]. There are two explanations for the absence of an LSD dose response for good drug effects in the present study compared with our previous studies. First, the true doses that were used in the previous studies were 60–70 and 150 µg rather than the reported 100 and 200 µg doses because of the use of an unstable formulation with a lower LSD content, as discussed elsewhere [20]. Second, the past comparison was between different subjects and studies [11, 26], whereas the present study used valid within-subject and within-study comparisons. In the present study, we observed a ceiling effect on the dose–response curve. Considering that the previously reported 200 µg dose likely contained only 150 µg of active LSD, additional positive effects may be reached with 150 µg compared with 100 µg. This possibility remains to be tested. One of our recent studies also used an analytically confirmed LSD dose of 100 µg, which produced scores on the VAS and 5D-ASC scale that were nominally higher than those that were reported after 100 µg administration in the present study [13] and more similar to the scores that were reported herein after 200 µg administration. Altogether, the available data support the view that mainly high acute positive effects of LSD can be induced at a 100 µg dose of LSD base. Therefore, we speculate that a dose of 100 µg of LSD may be selected for the treatment of depression or anxiety where higher Oceanic Boundlessness and lower anxiety ratings acutely induced by psychedelics predicted better treatment efficacy [16,17,18,19]. The 50 µg dose that was used in the present study also produced substantial positive mood effects and notably only very small and nonsignificant anxious ego dissolution, with no anxiety. Thus, the 50 µg dose may be useful for inducing a moderately intense and predominantly positive psychedelic experience. This low psychedelic dose would likely be a good starting dose to be used in patients with no previous experience with psychedelics or in subjects who are considered to be more sensitive to the effects of psychedelics [33] In the present study, LSD produced moderate elevations of arterial blood pressure and heart rate starting at the 50 µg dose that were largely similar to the effects of 100 and 200 µg. Similarly, previous studies that used pharmaceutically not well-characterized doses of 100 and 200 µg LSD found no difference in the acute cardiostimulant effects of these doses [11]. A previous study in patients did not observe any increases in blood pressure using a non-confirmed dose of 200 µg of LSD [34]. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine clearly has more pronounced cardiostimulant effects and a less favorable overall physical safety profile than LSD [13, 35]. In contrast, the psychotropic effects of LSD are significantly greater compared with MDMA [13] In the present study, administration of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin 1 h before LSD administration markedly reduced the subjective response to the 200 µg LSD dose to levels that were similar to the 25 µg dose. Retrospective reports showed that ketanserin and LSD together were identified correctly by the participants or mistaken as a low dose of LSD but never mistaken for a high dose of LSD. The present findings are consistent with a previous study in which ketanserin administration prior to the administration of 100 µg LSD almost completely prevented the acute effects of LSD [4]. These findings support the view that LSD primarily produces its acute psychedelic effects in humans via 5-HT2A receptor activation [3,4,5, 36], which was also shown for a high and fully psychedelic dose of LSD. ketanserin also prevented acute adverse effects of LSD and the LSD-induced heart rate response. However, the weak blood pressure-elevating effects of LSD were only transiently prevented by ketanserin and reappeared later during the LSD response. This observation is consistent with the relatively short half-life of ketanserin (i.e., 2 h) during the first 1–9 h following administration [37, 38] In the present study, 200 µg LSD significantly increased BDNF plasma concentration compared with placebo with a peak at 6 h. Additionally, there were nonsignificant increases in plasma BDNF after lower doses of LSD or after ketanserin with LSD. In previous studies, 100 µg LSD had no effect on BDNF plasma levels [13] up to 5 h while the psychedelic ayahuasca increased BDNF at 2 days. Further, higher BDNF levels were associated with lower depression ratings after administration of ayahuasca [39]. More research is needed to define the time course of the BDNF response and whether there is a link between psychedelics, BDNF, and the antidepressant response [39] In addition to providing dose–response data on full psychedelic doses of LSD, the present study further characterized the effects of small doses of LSD [9, 40]. The lowest dose that was used in the present study contained 25 µg of LSD base. This dose produced subjective “any drug effects” that were significantly different from placebo and retrospectively identified as LSD by the majority (>85%) of the participants. Very low doses of LSD have typically been referred to as “microdoses.” Psychedelic microdoses have been postulated to have beneficial prolonged effects on mood while producing no or only minimal acute adverse subjective effects [40,41,42,43]. Positive long-term effects of psychedelic microdoses remain to be documented [42], and remaining unclear are the LSD doses that actually have no acute subjective effects and thus could be considered microdoses [40]. Very low to low doses of LSD were recently studied in two placebo-controlled trials [9, 21, 44, 45]. One study also provided preliminary PK data [45]. In older healthy volunteers, 5–20 µg of LSD tartrate produced small but significant linear dose-dependent increases in ratings of all of the following: subjective drug effects, vigilance reduction, dizziness, and changes in body feeling [21, 45]. The frequency of adverse effects of LSD at doses up to 20 µg was not different from placebo. The mean plasma Cmax values of LSD (non-compartmental analyses) were 0.44 ng/ml (n = 8) after the administration of 20 µg of LSD tartrate [45] and 0.51 ng/ml after the administration of 25 µg of LSD base in the present study, indicating comparable dose-proportional peak concentrations. The previous study included younger healthy subjects and found dose-dependent increases in subjective ratings of “feel drug” and “like drug” on VASs and on the 5D-ASC scale after the administration of 6.5, 13, and 26 µg of LSD tartrate [9]. Notably, a 26 µg dose of LSD tartrate would be lower than the 25 µg dose of LSD base (i.e., 31 µg of LSD tartrate equivalent) that was used in the present study. Nevertheless, the 26 µg dose of LSD tartrate produced significant effects on the 5D-ASC scale compared with placebo and nominally greater ratings on the 5D-ASC subscales than the 25 µg dose that was used in the present study. Unfortunately, no plasma LSD concentration data have been published for the 26 µg dose of LSD tartrate [9]. Therefore, a comparison of drug exposures between this previous study and the present study to further validate the dose comparison is not possible. Altogether, the available data from these controlled studies, including the present study that used very small and small doses of LSD, indicate that the 25 µg dose of LSD is clearly acutely psychoactive in the majority of subjects. Doses in the range of 21–30 µg of LSD base may thus be considered “minidoses” rather than “microdoses.” Doses of LSD base in the 1–20 µg range may be considered “microdoses” but need further study. However, Doses of LSD base in the 1–20 µg range may already elicit small dose-dependent subjective effects, although Doses of LSD base in the 1–20 µg range are unlikely to relevantly impair cognition or produce adverse effects [9, 21, 44, 45] Overall, the present dose–response study characterized a range of LSD doses. Based on the available data, the following dosing terminology may be useful for future LSD research: “microdose” (1–20 µg), “minidose” (21–30 µg), and “psychedelic dose” (>30 µg). Within the psychedelic LSD dose range, good effects likely predominate at doses of 30–100 µg (good-effect dose), whereas ego dissolution and anxiety increase at doses above 100 µg (ego-dissolution dose) The present study has numerous strengths. Four different doses of LSD were used within subjects and compared with placebo under double-blind conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. A ketanserin-LSD condition was also included to elucidate the mechanism of action of LSD and enhance blinding between the different conditions. We also included equal numbers of male and female participants and used internationally established standardized and validated psychometric outcome measures. The doses of LSD were pharmaceutically well-characterized, and plasma LSD concentrations and PK parameters were determined up to 24 h for all doses. Notwithstanding these strengths, the present study also has limitations. The study used a highly controlled setting and included only healthy subjects. Additionally, participants willing to participate in LSD research are likely to have positive expectations and some participants had past substance experiences. Thus, subjects in different environments and patients with psychiatric disorders may respond differently to LSD", "tokens": [{"text": "LSD", "start": 421, "end": 424, "token_start": 74, "token_end":

talking therapies is that all talking therapies operate through language, thus risking getting caught in language traps. The PFM model recognises these traps and tries to target the excesses of language to enhance psychological flexibility. Psychedelics provide another route to disrupting ordinary language processes that unhelpfully narrow and constrain behaviour and appear to enhance psychological flexibility, potentially more intensely and without verbal instruction. Psychedelics offer a route to embodied awareness and the relief and learning this can bring. Psychedelics also offer the opportunity for more patients to experience profound psychological change than through talking therapy alone Conversely, the PFM can inform how psychedelic preparation and integration are conducted so as to enhance and sustain change. The PFM can guide preparation to potentially enhance the effects of psilocybin dosing sessions. Afterwards, as psilocybin induced psychological flexibility waxes and wanes, acceptance-focused work can help remind patients of how they can engage with they felt sense, continuing to open up to challenging events. Perhaps most importantly, the behaviour change emphasis of the PFM can empower patients to continue to connect with new perspectives gained and prolong and deepen the behaviour change that would likely have faded without support This paper outlined how the PFM model can be used to guide psilocybin assisted therapy for depression and reviewed qualitative evidence suggesting that PFM is central to the processes of change involved in this therapeutic modality. We also reviewed how the PFM has been adapted for use in psilocybin preparation and integration and how the resulting model, called ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody), is being utilised in an ongoing clinical trial. As the PFM is now being used as the principal therapeutic modality in other studies using psilocybin to treat depression (i.e., NYU, Yale) as well, we may be at the beginning of a new phase in psychedelic assisted therapy, in which the psychotherapy component is more fully nurtured, grown, and studied. It is our hope that the psychedelic therapy models of the future will be comprehensive enough to support habits of acceptance, connection and embodiment that last a lifetime and catalyse transformational processes in individuals and the communities in which they live", "tokens": [{"text": "Psychedelics", "start": 261, "end": 273, "token_start": 42, "token_end": 42, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "disrupting ordinary language processes", "start": 299, "end": 337, "token_start": 47, "token_end": 50, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "enhance psychological flexibility", "start": 400, "end": 433, "token_start": 60, "token_end": 62, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "Psychedelics", "start": 494, "end": 506, "token_start": 72, "token_end": 72, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "embodied awareness", "start": 524, "end": 542, "token_start": 77, "token_end": 78, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "Psychedelics", "start": 587, "end": 599, "token_start": 88, "token_end": 88, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "profound psychological change", "start": 659, "end": 688, "token_start": 98, "token_end": 100, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 961, "end": 971, "token_start": 145, "token_end": 145, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "psychological flexibility", "start": 980, "end": 1005, "token_start": 147, "token_end": 148, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 1450, "end": 1460, "token_start": 227, "token_end": 227, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "depression", "start": 1482, "end": 1492, "token_start": 231, "token_end": 231, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 1925, "end": 1935, "token_start": 309, "token_end": 309, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "depression", "start": 1945, "end": 1955, "token_start": 312, "token_end": 312, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}], "relations": [{"child": 47, "head": 42, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 60, "head": 42, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 77, "head": 72, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 98, "head": 88, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 147, "head": 145, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 231, "head": 227, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 312, "head": 309, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_79_2021-12-28_12:51:40.9.txt", "document": "The current meta-analysis evaluated effects of psilocybin coupled with supportive behavioral interventions on anxiety and depression. Although a small number of studies were included, available data were promising. Within-group effects at post-treatment and six-month follow-up showed large reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms with no evidence of publication bias. Qualitative assessment of risk of bias was more concerning, with high risk in several domains. High between-study heterogeneity suggests there may be systematic variation across the studies. Future meta-analyses should examine study features (e.g., psilocybin dose) as moderators of treatment effects Effects of psilocybin on anxiety and depression were also evident in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Effect sizes (gs = 0.82 to 0.83 for psilocybin vs. placebo) are similar to psychological interventions versus no treatment (d = 0.80; Wampold and Imel, 2015) and cognitive behavioral therapy versus no treatment (d = 0.82; Butler et al., 2006). Given both psilocybin and placebo groups received equivalent behavioral interventions, the additive benefit of psilocybin may be substantial. However, this effect was not robust to publication bias, highlighting the need for further placebo-controlled studies. As supportive behavioral interventions were included in all studies, results cannot be interpreted to indicate general benefits associated with the use of psilocybin in the absence of support Additional large-scale studies examining the effects of psilocybin on treatment-resistant depression may be warranted, as only one of the four studies focused on this population. It may be valuable to evaluate various behavioral interventions to support or extend benefits of psilocybin treatments The current meta-analysis has several limitations. Only four studies (N = 117) were available, limiting the reliability of the observed effects. Small sample studies can introduce biases (Button et al., 2013). Heterogeneity in effect sizes and design features were generally high. High risk of bias was present for most studies (performance bias and detection bias due to lack of blinding, attrition bias). Selection bias also limits generalizability of the available evidence as all participants were willing to receive a Schedule I substance. Three of the four studies included individuals with terminal cancer diagnoses, which may not represent anxiety and depression generally. Limited racial/ethnic diversity reduces generalizability Nonetheless, the current meta-analysis suggests psilocybin in combination with behavioral support may provide a safe and effective treatment option for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Through careful chemical design, we were able to engineer tabernanthalog (TBG)—a nonhallucinogenic analogue of 5-MeO-DMT that promotes cortical neuron structural plasticity through activation of 5-HT2A receptors.33 Like psychedelic compounds, TBG has demonstrated preclinical therapeutic effects suggesting that TBG might be effective at treating a range of neuropsychiatric diseases including depression, alcohol use disorder, and heroin use disorder.33 Future work needs to address why functionally selective 5-HT2A receptor ligands such as TBG can produce plasticity and therapeutic behavioral responses without inducing behavioral effects characteristic of classic psychedelics Ultimately, clinical trials will be necessary to determine if psychoplastogenic analogues of psychedelics can produce therapeutic effects in humans without inducing mystical-like experiences. Additionally, there are several other experiments that could potentially be performed to elucidate the roles of both subjective effects and enhanced neural plasticity in the therapeutic properties of psychedelics. One option is to employ a compound producing mystical-like effects without promoting neuronal growth in the PFC as a true active placebo. However, no such compound has been identified yet, and such a compound might not even exist if hallucinogenic effects inevitably lead to enhanced neural plasticity Alternatively, psychedelics could be administered to patients under anesthesia. This would solve the blinding issue by preventing patients from experiencing the altered state of consciousness. Such an experimental design could be a powerful way to dissociate the psychological from the neurobiological effects of these drugs. However, care must be taken in the design of such studies, as several common anesthetics are known to promote neural plasticity and produce antidepressant effects care To the best of my knowledge, no clinical trial has administered a classic serotonergic psychedelic after the induction of general anesthesia. However, several studies have demonstrated that intraoperative ketamine can improve postoperative mood despite the fact that patients were unconscious during ketamine administration.34−36 While this suggests that ketamine-induced mystical experiences may not be necessary to produce therapeutic responses, the patients in these studies were not severely depressed. Thus, studies administering ketamine under general anesthesia to patients with major depressive disorder are warranted, and at least one such study is currently ongoing While preliminary evidence suggests that the subjective effects of psychedelics are not necessary to produce therapeutic responses, the subjective effects of psychedelics are not necessary to produce therapeutic responses may be critical for achieving maximal efficacy. Though the strong positive correlation between mystical-type experiences and the strength of therapeutic responses does not imply causation, the strong positive correlation between mystical-type experiences and the strength of therapeutic responses does not imply causation does implicate either psychological mechanisms or perhaps an exceptionally strong placebo effect in the impressive effect sizes observed following psychedelic-assisted therapy. Thus, the combination of a pharmacologically induced state of heightened neural plasticity with a profound subjective experience could prove invaluable for treating those who are especially ill or who have attempted other treatments without success Despite the promising therapeutic responses produced by psychedelic-assisted therapy, the intense subjective effects of these drugs make it unlikely that these drugs will ever become widespread treatments for disorders such as depression. In contrast, strategies for rewiring pathological neural circuitry without producing psychedelic-like mystical effects hold enormous promise as potential first-line treatments for a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. Regardless, nonhallucinogenic analogues of psychedelics will provide a wealth of information about the fundamental neurobiology underlying both compound-induced neural plasticity and hallucinogenic effects.

(43−45) Recent data also suggests that a single hallucinogenic dose of DMT can change rodent brain structure and behavior long after the drug has been cleared from the body. (16,24) Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that a nonhallucinogenic 1 mg/kg dose of DMT leads to increased frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in layer V pyramidal neurons of the PFC 24 h after administration. (16) Therefore, we hypothesized that administering DMT on a chronic, intermittent, low dose regimen—similar to psychedelic microdosing—might alter behavior To the best of our knowledge, there has only been one peer-reviewed scientific report on the effects of psychedelic microdosing in rodents. This study employed three doses of psilocin spaced over 6 days, with behavioral testing occurring 48 h after the final dose. (46) In agreement with our findings, the authors report no statistically significant changes in EPM behavior when two-tailed statistical tests were employed. The distinct lack of robust anxiogenic-like effects following chronic, intermittent, low doses of psychedelics is striking when compared to the effects of acute high doses. A hallucinogenic dose of DMT (10 mg/kg) decreases exploratory behavior in the NIL paradigm (i.e., both locomotion and rearing), decreases the number of open arm entries in the EPM, and increases freezing behavior immediately following the administration of foot shocks. (24) None of these effects are observed when a subhallucinogenic dose (1 mg/kg) of DMT is administered on a chronic intermittent schedule (Figures 2 and 3c) Unlike the anxiogenic-like effects produced by an acute hallucinogenic dose of DMT, the beneficial effects on fear extinction learning and forced swim behavior (24) are reproduced by the chronic, intermittent low dose regimen (Figures 3f and 4). These antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects are consistent with the anecdotal human reports regarding psychedelic microdosing providing strong supporting evidence that psychedelic microdosing might actually have therapeutic potential. Compounds capable of enhancing fear extinction learning in rodents, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), (47,48) are excellent candidates for treating PTSD symptoms in humans We hypothesize that chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT increase the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC that project to the basolateral amygdala and dorsal raphe nucleus to decrease the expression of conditioned fear responses and increase swimming behavior in the forced swim test, respectively. DMT and other psychedelics are potent psychoplastogens—compounds capable of promoting the rapid growth of dendritic branches, spines, and synapses—due to DMT and other psychedelics ability to stimulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through activation of 5-HT2A receptors. (16) These receptors are enriched in the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain that is known to exert top-down control over mood and anxiety. It is likely that the behavioral changes induced by chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT are the result of positive neuroadaptations in circuits involving the PFC that are relevant to fear extinction (22) and effortful response to behavioral challenge (i.e., FST) (21) as DMT has an extremely short half-life in rats (ca. 15 min) (49) and the behaviors were performed on days when DMT was NOT administered. In fact, we have previously shown that a 1 mg/kg dose of DMT increases the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs in the PFC long after DMT had been cleared from the body. Despite producing similar anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like behavioral effects, an acute hallucinogenic dose and chronic, intermittent, low doses of DMT produce very different biochemical and structural phenotypes. We have previously shown that a single hallucinogenic dose of DMT (10 mg/kg) increases dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons of the PFC, (16) but a similar effect was not observed following administration of chronic, intermittent low doses (1 mg/kg) of DMT (Figure 5). We hypothesize that chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT promote sufficient plasticity to strengthen key circuits involved in the regulation of mood and fear, thus impacting behavior, but that homeostatic plasticity tightly controls the overall synaptic input to these neurons leading to similar spine densities between treatment groups over time While there were no major behavioral differences between male and female rats following DMT treatment, there were distinct changes in neuronal structure. Dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons of the PFC was unchanged in male rats administered chronic, intermittent, low doses of DMT; however, female rats exhibited a reduction in spine density (Figure 5). As psychedelics are known to increase glutamate release in the cortex, (50) the reduced spine density observed in females could reflect greater sensitivity to glutamatergic excitotoxicity. This highlights the fact that the overall psychedelic microdosing load, which includes the amount of drug in each dose, the frequency of administration, and the length of treatment, is likely to be critical for achieving the beneficial effects of psychedelic microdosing without negative repercussions. Long-term intermittent use of ayahuasca is correlated with thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in humans, (51) but not increased risk for mental illness. (52) However, Nichols and co-workers have shown that chronic (>3 months), intermittent, high doses of LSD administered to rats produce neuroadaptations leading to a persistent behavioral state consisting of hyperactivity, anhedonia, and social deficits. (53) These behavioral changes are accompanied by significant gene expression changes in the PFC related to neural plasticity. (35) As a similar dose of LSD given over 11 days resulted in antidepressant-like effects, (54) it appears that the total length of treatment is critical for determining behavioral outcomes A single hallucinogenic dose of several psychedelic compounds has been shown to increase gene expression of several genes related to neural plasticity. (55,56) However, we did not observe similar changes following the administration of chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT (Figure 6). Duman and co-workers also observed that repeated dosing of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), an amphetamine-based psychedelic, caused minimal changes in BDNF expression in the cortex when compared to a single acute dose. Duman and co-workers hypothesized that 5-HT2 downregulation might explain the differences observed between the two dosing regimens. However, in the case of chronic, intermittent administration of low dose DMT, we do not observe any changes in HTR2A expression (Figure 6), and HTR2A has been previously shown that DMT does not induce receptor downregulation in cellular studies, (57) nor does HTR2A cause tolerance in humans. (58) This distinct lack of increased BDNF expression following chronic, intermittent, low doses of DMT highlights an important mechanistic difference between psychedelic microdosing and chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other slow-acting antidepressants. In the latter case, increased BDNF expression is believed to facilitate the repair of damaged circuits relevant to mood and anxiety. (59) Chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT appear to accomplish this without any obvious changes in the expression of BDNF or other genes known to be differentially regulated following administration

present retrospective cross-sectional survey study examined whether psychedelic occasioned mystical-type or psychological insight experiences predicted decreases in depression and anxiety following a psychedelic experience (H1), acute psychedelic effects predicted increases in psychological flexibility (H2), increases in psychological flexibility predicted decreases in depression/anxiety, (H3) and whether increases in psychological flexibility mediated the relationships between acute psychedelic effects and decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms (H4). Findings from our regression and path analysis models supported each of these hypotheses. Consistent with prior studies (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016; Davis et al, 2019), in the present study mystical experiences were associated with decreases in depression and anxiety. Importantly, these observations were extended by showing that experiences of psychological insight during a psychedelic experience are also associated with decreases in depression and anxiety. Further, when mystical and psychological insight effects were included simultaneously as predictors of changes in our models, results showed that psychological insight stands out as a more robust predictor of change, as evidenced by the larger direct (Insight: β=.46 versus Mystical: β=.09) and indirect (Insight: β=.29 versus Mystical: β=.06) coefficients in the path analysis. That psychological insight is strongly related to decreases in depression and anxiety is perhaps not surprising given the history of insight-oriented therapies (Connolly Gibbons et al., 2007), but it has also been questioned whether gaining insight is sufficient in and of it to produce lasting changes in behavior or mental health functioning (Kuncewicz, Lachowicz-Tabaczek, and Zaluski, 2014; Leichsenring et al., 2006). To this point, our models also showed that psychological insight was predictive of change when accounting for the correlation between insight and mystical experiences. Insightful as well as mystical-type experiences have been identified as subtypes of the phenomenon of quantum change, which refers to a sudden, distinctive, benevolent, and enduring experience resulting in personal transformations that affect a broad range of personal emotions, cognitions and behaviors (Miller and C’de Baca, 2001). Such experiences after taking a psychedelic have also been implicated in decreases in alcohol use among individuals with alcohol use disorder (GarciaRomeu et al., 2019). Furthermore, findings from the present study underscore a potential explanation for how acute psychedelic experiences, including gaining psychological insight and mystical experiences, may exert such changes. Specifically, we demonstrated the importance of increases in psychological flexibility as a mediator of the positive therapeutic effects. Although several other mechanisms have been proposed at various levels of functioning, from changes in the entropy of brain network connectivity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014) to the importance of awe/ego dissolution (Hendricks, 2018; Preller & Vollenweider, 2018), findings from this study are consistent with evidence demonstrating that psychedelic effects are associated with changes in psychological flexibility among a small sample of subjects who use the psychedelic ayahuasca (Kuypers et al., 2016), and research showing that increases in psychological flexibility is associated with positive depression and anxiety outcomes (Twohig & Levin, 2017). Although the exploration of potential mediators of psychedelic effects on therapeutic outcomes is in therapeutic outcomes early stages, if psychological flexibility emerges as a consistent and robust mediator of effects in prospective clinical trials, then the field of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy should consider integrating psychedelic administration with contextual behavioral therapies (e.g., ACT; Hayes et al., 2006) or other therapies designed to target psychological flexibility. Such therapies are designed to enhance processes of change by supporting increases in psychological flexibility which could be enhanced through the administration of a psychedelic. Moreover, it is possible that some acute psychedelic effects overlap with the core processes of the ACT model of psychopathology (Hayes et al., 2006). For example, consistent with the core processes of ACT, qualitative analysis of first-hand accounts of tobacco smokers in a clinical trial examining the effect of psilocybin-assisted therapy (Noorani et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2014), suggested that 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) psychedelic experiences helped 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) see 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) in the context of 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) addiction (i.e., self as context), realize that 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) are not the labels (e.g., smoker) which 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) previously identified as (i.e., defusion), understood 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) values more clearly than before (i.e., values), and connected with the fullness of the present moment and 2018; Johnson et al., 2014) experience of it (i.e., contact with the present moment). Although not highlighted in the qualitative reports per se, another component of the ACT model, committed action, was demonstrated in the clinical trial by the high rates (80%) of biologically verified abstinence at 6 months post-treatment (Johnson et al., 2014). These data suggest that psychedelics appear to occasion both mindfulness/ acceptance processes as well as commitment and behavior change processes. However, more research is needed to systematically investigate these processes in rigorous longitudinal trials among individuals with depression or anxiety in order to replicate these findings in this population. This study has several limitations. Internet-based recruitment and data collection procedures were anonymous. Although this likely increased participation from individuals from a variety of geographical locations, This study would have excluded people who prefer not to participate in research conducted on the internet. Further, a limitation of survey methods is that all reports are retrospective, increasing the likelihood that current affect and personality bias could influence recollection of subjective psychedelic experiences as well as depression and anxiety symptoms that were experienced many years ago. However, this potential confound is not expected to be more or less than similar confounds in other retrospective survey research (Davis et al., 2018; Davis et al, 2019). Additionally, the parent study from which the data were drawn, was designed to investigate the acute effect of gaining insight during a psychedelic experience. Although the mean score of the intensity of mystical experiences in this sample was similar to prior studies (Davis et al., 2018), suggesting comparably strong mystical effects in addition to insight effects, we cannot rule out the possibility that recruiting people who specifically reported gaining insight as part of a psychedelic experience accounts for some of the differential strength in the association between acute insight and other study variables. Another limitation to this study is that, despite our efforts to recruit individuals with diverse backgrounds by placement of notices on a variety of internet forums, respondents were primarily young, white, and male. Although our sample is consistent with prior studies of psychedelic users using similar recruitment procedures (Davis et al., 2018; Barret et al., 2016), similar to Michaels et al. (2018) our strongly encourage future researchers to continue efforts in recruiting a diverse sample. There are several possible explanations for the lack of diverse representation in psychedelic survey studies. For example, it could be that the topic of these studies are not interesting to some potential respondents, that there is a perceived risk involved with reporting an illegal behavior, or that the internet computer format excluded individuals from differing socio-economic backgrounds. Efforts to overcome these factors could include a community-based participatory research methodology (Israel et al., 2005), wherein the study is designed through engagement with leaders from a variety of diverse backgrounds, with the intention of better understanding the ways in which the study can be designed to connect with individuals from these communities", "tokens": [{"text": "mystical-type",

abstraction, but no less real or predictively useful for that. On the predictive coding construal of the integrative self, the self-model functions as a centre of representational gravity—not just in narrative processes but also in lower-level affective, bodily, and spatial processes. It is a representation of the ′point′ around which everything else revolves. But crucially, it is not a representation as of a mere point, but as of a particular. This is why we reject Dennett’s metaphysics of selfhood, as well as Hohwy and Michael’s claim that the self-model has enough of the right attributes to qualify as a self If our conjectures are right, the content of the self-model is Cartesian: it is of a substance or an entity which has the properties and experiences. And here we agree with Metzinger that there ‘is just no entity there, no individual substance, and scientifically we can predict and explain everything we want to predict and explain in a much more parsimonious way’ (quoted in Marshall 2016). Thus, our view is structurally analogous to Mackie’s (1977) error theory of morality, conjoining the psychosemantic claim that the self-representation is as of a Cartesian substance with the ontological claim that no such substance exists. It is also substantially similar to Metzinger’s views about the self-model, developed in the context of a specific case and a mechanistic proposal (self-binding on predictive processing principles) about how the model performs the model adaptive functions for the organism All of this fits smoothly with the idea that the DMN and SLN implement narrative and embodied aspects of self-representation, respectively. The self-representation as we conceive The self-representation as we conceive serves as an organizing principle at different levels and in different domains of processing. Perceptual representations are organized in an egocentric space; interoceptive representations are interpreted as signals of adaptively relevant events or ‘core relational themes’ (Prinz 2004); and narratives are structured around the fortunes and prospects of a protagonist. At all levels, salience is attributed, attention directed, and information integrated in accordance with the relevance of information to the organism’s goals.

The following also increase: geodesic distance, clustering coefficient and local efficiency. However, the global efficiency decreases. Overall, we find an increase of local integration and a decrease of global integration in the functional brain networks We interpret these findings in the context of some well understood prototypical classes of networks. Regular lattices have fixed coordination number, hence all nodes have the same degree and the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution is thus zero. In contrast, the entropy is high in networks with broad distributions of degree. The observed increase in entropy after Ayahuasca ingestion indicates that the degree distribution becomes broader. In the context of the Watts-Strogatz model59, clustering and geodesic distance both decrease when highly regular networks are transformed into small-world networks by randomly re-assigning the links. Whereas clustering and geodesic distances decrease with increasing randomness in such models, we find the opposite behavior for Ayahuasca, i.e., randomness as measured by the Shannon entropy of the node degree distribution increases in parallel with clustering and geodesic distances. Hence, our findings cannot be reduced to simple explanations of greater or lesser randomness. Locally, there is an increase in integration (as measured by network efficiency), but globally there is a decrease in integration. Indeed the increase of geodesic distance and decrease of global efficiency after Ayahuasca intake signify that the functional brain networks are less globally integrated. One possible interpretation of these findings is that the increase of local robustness and the decrease of global integration reflect a variation in modular structure of the network. Recent studies have reported the presence of modularity in functional brain networks on several scales50, 60, 61. Modular networks are characterized by the existence of reasonably well-defined subnetworks in which internal connections are denser than connections between distinct subnetworks50. However, traditional algorithms62,63,64 were not able to detect variation on modular structure features between our sets of networks Our results are broadly consistent with the entropic brain hypothesis, hence Our discuss the latter in the context of Our findings. The hypothesis maintains that the mental state induced by psychedelics, which the original authors term “primary-state,” presents relatively elevated entropy in some features of brain organization, compared to the ordinary waking state (termed “secondary”)11. Although it may be somewhat counter-intuitive that the psychedelic state is considered primary while ordinary consciousness is secondary, ordinary consciousness is secondary hypothesis is inherently plausible considering that a wider spectrum of experiences is possible with psychedelics than in ordinary consciousness. In this sense, ordinary consciousness can be thought of as a restriction or constrained special case of a more primary consciousness. The hypothesized lower entropy of ordinary consciousness relative to primary consciousness is attributed to this reduction of freedom. In fact, the idea that ordinary consciousness is not primary was previously put forth by Alan Watts to describe what later became widely known as mindfulness 65. (We emphasize that the terms “primary” and “secondary” are used not as value judgements, but rather to denote temporal order, i.e. the order of appearance, both evolutionarily as well as in the maturation of a healthy individual) More specifically, we believe that the observed increase in entropy may be related to the temporary removal of the some of the restrictions that are necessary for sustaining ordinary (adult trained) consciousness. With these restrictions temporarily gone, the entropy increases and the mind may become effectively more “free”, attaining a more flexible state in which self-referential narratives and thoughts about the past or the future are no longer mentally identified with the reality that they represent. We emphasize, however, that “correlation is not causation” and that the entropy increases may occurr in parallel with the loss of constraints, rather than bear a direct causal relation to rather. These ideas are further explored in the Supplementary Discussion (see also refs. [80,81,82,83]) Relatively few studies have investigated entropy in brain functional networks, hence additional comments are in order. Tagliazucchi et al.14 showed that psilocybin (psychedelic present in some species of mushrooms) may be responsible for increases of a different entropy measure in functional connectivity of the 4 regions of Default Mode Network (DMN), a relevant functional network related to resting state. Recently, Yao et al.66 correlated entropy increases in the human brain with age. This study also supports the view that entropy is correlated to brain function (and perhaps also This study development). Moreover, in agreement with our results, a study by Schröter et al.4 similarly suggests that functional network topology may have a central role in consciousness quality. functional network topology may have a central role in consciousness quality investigated the effects on the human brain of the anesthetic propofol, which can induce loss of consciousness67. functional network topology may have a central role in consciousness quality reported a decrease of the clustering coefficient, which is strongly influenced by degree distribution (however, geodesic distance remained unchanged). Very recently, Lebedev et al.15 and separately Schartner et al.16 have reported evidence of increases in measures of entropy, the former with LSD and the latter with LSD, psilocybin and ketamine We briefly comment on the limitations of We method: (i) the reduced number of subjects and the fact that all of them were experienced with Ayahuasca do not allow population inferences and do not elucidate whether the effects observed here were only due the acute administration or if previous experience also played a significant role; (ii) expectancy and suggestion were not controlled, as placebo was not used; (iii) networks were built upon a number of critical choices, such as the atlas used to partition the brain, the method used to build the correlation matrix, and the cutoff thresholds for generating the adjacency matrices from correlation matrices68, 69, which may affect the final results; (iv) the chosen range of correlation values automatically limits the networks’ behavior to a small-world network. Despite this limitation, it is important to highlight that several studies have consistently demonstrated that brain networks exhibit a small-world behavior Finally, We speculate about whether or not We finding of larger mean geodesic distances may have any relation to self-reports of “mind-expansion” by users of psychedelics (see also ref. 16). Could there be a direct relation between entropy increases and the higher creativity reported by users of psychedelics? Such questions merit further investigation. In conclusion, our results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that psychedelics increase the entropy in brain functions. By calculating the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution of complex networks generated from fMRI data, we have taken a new low-computational-cost approach to investigating brain function under

psychedelics being studied as potentially therapeutic agents to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with life-threatening disease. Therefore, the present systematic review aimed to determine depression and anxiety associated with life-threatening disease efficacy, tolerability and mechanisms of action. The main findings were that psychedelics produced significant anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects with good tolerability response. These results, in addition to the putative mechanisms of action underlying These results beneficial effects, will be further discussed below In all studies, psychedelic administration caused statistically significant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings corroborate the limited previous research conducted in animal studies and healthy volunteers, as well as anecdotal evidence describing improved mood and reduced feelings of apprehension following psychedelic administration (Riba et al., 2001, Hilber and Chapillon, 2005, Farzin and Mansouri, 2006, Fortunato et al., 2009, Fortunato et al., 2010aa, Fortunato et al., 2010b, Santos et al., 2007, Griffiths et al., 2008, Kast, 1967, Richards et al., 1977). These improvements were consistently observed across a variety of rating scales, and this is suggestive of a genuine therapeutic effect rather than a specific scale's tendency to show a positive effect. Moreover, the lack of equivalent symptom reduction in control patients indicates that the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects can be attributed to psychedelic intervention. Participants also described the experience as spiritually meaningful, resulting in decreased disease-related demoralisation and hopelessness as well as improved quality of life (Ross et al., 2016, Griffiths et (Ross et al, 2016, Grob et al., 2011, G et al., 2014) Psychedelics’ ability to provide acute symptom relief, within one day, is advantageous when compared to current antidepressants, which take several weeks to work. This is because antidepressants’ delayed therapeutic effects can lead to non-compliance and contribute to increased morbidity (Machado-Vieira et al., 2010, Tylee and Walters, 2007). Moreover, since psychedelics’ beneficial effects are maintained with impressive response rates for several months, this could imply that less frequent administration is required compared to typical pharmacotherapy for anxiety and depression. This, coupled to the fact that exposure to treatment is monitored, could help to overcome treatment-resistance stemming from non-compliance Psychedelic treatment was generally well-tolerated. The commonest adverse effects included transient anxiety, headaches, nausea and vomiting. These were generally self-resolving except for three patients on LSD requiring benzodiazepines to counteract treatment-induced anxiety and/or emotional distress. One of these patients had received the placebo-like low-dose of LSD, suggesting that the need for tranquilising medication was also dependent on individual susceptibility in addition to dose-related drug factors. Vomiting was considered cathartic and thus an integral component of the therapeutic experience (Osório et al., 2015). Nevertheless, ways to manage (Osório et al such as by pre-medicating with an anti-emetic can be explored. LSD-induced paranoia, illusions and feeling cold were predictable side effects and may be explained by its superior hallucinogenic strength compared to psilocybin and ayahuasca (D et al., 2016, Schmid et al., 2015). All psychedelics also increased heart rate and blood pressure. The statistically significant elevations reported by Grob et al. and Ross et al. with psilocybin may have been confounded by niacin's ability to acutely lower blood pressure through vasodilation in the controls (Bays and Rader, 2009). Nevertheless, medical intervention was never required Previous research has shown these compounds to be relatively safe when used in medically-controlled environments (Guimarães dos Santos, 2013, J et al., 2008, Nichols, 2004). They have no reported risk of dependence as daily administration causes serotonin (5-HT2A) receptor downregulation, leading to rapid induction of tolerance (Nichols, 2004). In fact, They may even have anti-addictive properties (B et al., 2015, J et al., 2014). Concerns over anti-addictive properties (B et al., 2015, J et al impact on mental health have been challenged by large-scale population studies showing that psychedelic users have lower rates of psychological distress and suicidality compared to individuals who had never used psychedelics but an equivalent amount of other recreational drugs (Hendricks et al., 2015, Krebs and Johansen, 2013). Although the observational nature of these studies cannot establish causality, these studies suggests that psychedelics are not counter-productive over time. However, the findings of this research need to be considered in light of certain limitations. Only seven studies were included in this review, each with a small sample size (range 6–51 subjects), and a higher proportion of females, particularly Caucasian, among the cohort. These factors limit the generalisability of the results. Additionally, the significant level of bias present across the studies (Fig. 3a/b) affects the reliability of the conclusions. Three studies were open-label proof-of-concept studies, recruiting patients largely by self-referral who are possibly more inclined to endorse the positive effects of psychedelics. The fact that patients are aware of receiving the active drug could introduce expectancy bias, whereby patients anticipate a beneficial effect. The double-blind randomised nature of the other four studies served to minimise this predisposition. However, even in these instances maintaining blinding proved challenging, as the drugs’ psychoactive effects were florid, with patients experiencing a heightened state of consciousness with marked emotional accompaniments. Administering active placebos in the form of niacin or very low-dose psychedelic was an attempt to overcome this, as these would induce mild physiological and/or psychological effects but would be incapable of substantially facilitating the therapeutic process. When the psychedelic was administered to both study groups, the psychedelic also permitted study investigators to instruct patients in such a way as to reduce expectancy bias i.e. that everyone would receive the drug, albeit different doses. Nevertheless, it is likely that patients were usually unblinded by patients experience on the active drug. Psychedelics are also known to promote suggestibility, which might have further enhanced positive outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015). The influence of Carhart-Harris et al., 2015) would be difficult to avoid in judging outcomes, especially since the scales used to measure efficacy are largely subjective. Therefore, at least inclusion of blinded clinician-raters is necessary in future studies. Additionally, more objective outcome parameters are possible and should be considered. For example, geolocation from mobile phones can be measured, as amount of time spent at home correlates with depression severity (Palmius et al., 2017). In cancer patients, treatment efficacy could also be reflected in patients’ increased adherence to treatment or reduced need for narcotic pain-relief (Grof et al., 1973). Future trials could also address the role of expectancy and suggestibility by measuring and controlling for these variables. For example, patients could be asked about patients pre-treatment expectations, and outcomes from self-referred patients could be compared with those from patients referred by clinicians. If expectancy and suggestibility are found to be influential, expectancy and suggestibility are found to be influential could be treated as exploitable components of the treatment model rather than confounding variables (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) Limitations also exist in treating participants with grave somatic diseases in clinical trials. This is because improvements or deteriorations in deteriorations illness can impact psychological parameters independent of therapeutic intervention. Additionally, patients who become too ill to continue or pass away during the course of the experiment contribute to missing data. These factors can introduce bias in the results and affect the overall evidence base for psychedelics’ therapeutic potential In terms of methodology, accepting only English citations with full publication access may have introduced a minor degree of publication bias (Pilkington et al., 2005). Moreover, the subjective nature of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool may have caused inaccuracies in the bias assessment results. Considering that inter-assessor agreement can be inconsistent (Armijo-Olivo et al., 2014, Armijo-Olivo et al., 2012, Savović et al., 2014), inclusion of multiple reviewers would strengthen inter-assessor agreement can be inconsistent (Armijo-Olivo et al validity as any discrepancies would be discussed. Before widespread use of psychedelics can be contemplated, there are several challenges that future research needs to address. Firstly, the aforementioned promising results need to be replicated in larger-scale trials with more participants. Ideally, these studies would also be longer in duration to determine long-term safety and efficacy. Although observational studies have provided some evidence that long-term psychedelic use is not harmful (Guimarães dos Santos, 2013, Bouso et al., 2012, Barbosa et al., 2016, Barbosa et al., 2012, Hendricks et al., 2015, Krebs and Johansen, 2013), the inherent limitations of these studies call for more robust long-term clinical trials to be carried out. It must be recognised that despite clinical interest in psychedelics resuming, regulatory obstacles still exist, therefore performing such research is not straightforward (Nutt et al., 2013). Nevertheless, future questions to be answered include whether repeated administration for long-term treatment is possible and how frequently long-term treatment should be done Alongside these, optimum dosing must be determined, and target population identified. For example, Griffiths et al. reduced the psilocybin dose once the trial had commenced because there were concerns over the high dose causing too psychologically challenging experiences, and the low dose producing psychoactive effects, thus not serving as an appropriate placebo-like control (Griffiths et al., 2016). Protocol amendments like this are less than ideal, therefore defining correct dosing is key. Regarding target population, it is necessary to identify whether this treatment should only be considered for individuals with depression and anxiety that are non-responsive to other treatment methods, or whether it could be prophylactic for patients with severe symptoms. This is relevant as long-term antidepressant use can obstruct the potential therapeutic action of psychedelics (Bonson et al., 1996). As it is unclear whether a wash-out period would be enough to negate this effect, it seems worthwhile to avoid delaying psychedelic treatment too long. Additionally, treating cancer-related psychological distress with psychedelics is desirable, however in reality cancer-related psychological distress with psychedelics is limited by a variety of exclusion criteria. Patients may also be reluctant to participate in such an intervention as high doses have sometimes been associated with transient episodes of psychological distress or anxiety (G et al., 2011, Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2016) It would also be necessary to determine an early proximal end-point to prove initial impact of treatment. As previously mentioned, several studies have shown that the intensity of the subjective mystical experience was correlated with long-term clinical outcomes (Ross et al., 2016, Griffiths et al., 2016, Carhart-Harris et al., 2018, Grof et al., 1973, Roseman et al., 2017, Pahnke, 1969, C-H et al., 2017). Hence, this could serve as a useful early predictor of treatment response, but first this needs to be further explored and better defined Finally, cost-effectiveness must be established. The fact that psychological support or at least a supportive environment are required every time could be a major limitation (Johnson et al., 2008). In light of this, future research needs to determine the relative therapeutic contribution of psychotherapy as part of the treatment model. The results presented herein indicate that psychedelics caused comparable anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects when administered with and without formal psychological intervention. Although the high degree of heterogeneity among studies limits this interpretation, The results suggests that providing a supportive environment may be enough. Understanding whether this is the case is important, as minimising therapy requirement is desirable to reduce costs, however such therapy minimisation should not compromise treatment efficacy or jeopardise patient safety. Overall, the direct medical costs need to be balanced against the social and economic costs of illness (C-H et al., 2017).", "tokens": [{"text": "Ayahuasca", "start": 0, "end": 9, "token_start": 0,

"coreferenced_full_texts_69_2021-12-28_12:51:40.4.txt", "document": "Scientific interest in the effects of psychedelics has risen sharply in the past decade. Preclinical and clinical studies leveraging modern neuroscientific methods have produced various novel results with significant implications for understanding the neuropharmacology of human cognition, emotion and self-regulation, discovering potential trans-diagnostic treatment mechanisms in psychiatry and the development of novel rapid-acting and long-lasting treatment approaches Pharmacological challenge studies investigating the acute effects of single doses of psychedelics in healthy human participants have revealed important insights into the role of the 5-HT2A receptor in human cognition, emotion and self-regulation. These studies have shown that this specific receptor system is implicated in modulating social functioning, mood regulation and coherent self-representations. Importantly, these studies have also revealed the importance of targeting and studying specific sub-receptor systems to be able to conclusively understand human psychopharmacology and eventually be able to inform the development of new pharmacological therapeutics Recent neuroimaging studies have furthermore started to increase our understanding of the ways in which psychedelics temporarily change the functional architecture of the brain. Although different analytical approaches often limit the comparability between studies (see Box 2), some congruent patterns have started to emerge. Changes in functional and directed connectivity between the thalamus and cortical areas have been reported across different analysis techniques31,70,71. In addition, increased synchrony of sensory brain regions and decreased integrity of associative brain regions (including the DMN and the frontoparietal control network) have been reported after the administration of LSD, psilocybin and DMT31,78,79,83,86,87,89,96,153. However, it has to be noted that some of these effects are sensitive to GSR as outlined in Box 2. Increases in various measures of entropy and signal complexity have also been reported after the administration of LSD, psilocybin and DMT101,102,104,105,106. Other analytical approaches, such as the investigation of between-network connectivity during the resting state, have so far revealed inconsistent results or still need replication. These results support hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive but, rather, reflect different aspects of changes in neuronal dynamics. It is conceivable that future studies will reveal a more detailed (in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution) pattern of psychedelic-induced changes in brain connectivity that will allow one to better associate these neuronal effects with specific psychedelic-induced subjective experiences Studies of the effects of psychedelics in healthy participants have shown that these substances modulate a person’s self-focus, reduce negative emotional processing and strengthen social functioning12,120,138. Patients across different disorders who underwent treatment with psychedelics identified these effects as contributing to treatment success149,150. These experiences may therefore represent trans-diagnostic mechanisms for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses within and beyond the framework of psychedelic-assisted therapy. Additionally, preclinical results point to the potential of induced neuroplasticity as a promising neuronal mechanism that could be leveraged in psychotherapy Lastly, studies in patient populations show that psychedelics may constitute promising therapeutic agents that represent a novel treatment model in psychiatry: psychedelics may constitute promising therapeutic agents that represent a novel treatment model in psychiatry have been shown to act rapidly and to have long-lasting effects after only a few doses. This is in stark contrast to the current treatment approaches in psychiatry, which usually consist of a regular intake of psychotropic medication. However, many open questions remain. The exact mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects are still not well understood and beneficial clinical results need to be replicated in larger trials. It is unclear whether the therapeutic effects of these substances are due to these substances direct effects on brain activity and connectivity or due to the cognitive and psychological experience of an altered state of consciousness. In other words, it is unclear whether the conscious experience of the psychedelic-induced subjective effects is necessary for therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the field still needs to uncover individual predictors or biomarkers of treatment efficacy. The impact of different approaches to accompanying psychotherapy will also require empirical investigation. Accompanying psychotherapy may turn out to be of critical importance, if the proposed neuroplastic effects of psychedelics indeed contribute to Accompanying psychotherapy clinical efficacy. Using psychedelics in a clinical setting can therefore be understood as pharmacologically assisted psychotherapy that leverages the molecular, systems-level and functional alterations induced by

cancer-related psychiatric and existential distress at two long-term follow-ups. The data suggest that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy was associated with large and significant reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety, as well as improvements in spiritual well-being at an average of 3.2 and 4.5 years following psilocybin administration, after a crossover. The magnitudes of reductions relative to baseline in primary measures of anxiety and depression were large, with the largest effect sizes seen for global distress of combined anxiety and depression. Approximately 60–80% of participants continued to meet criteria for clinical antidepressant or anxiolytic response and remission at the second LTFU. At the second LTFU, participants overwhelmingly (71–100%) attributed subjective experiences of positive changes to the psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy experience, reporting improved well-being or life satisfaction, and rating it among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of participants overwhelmingly (71–100%) lives Due to the limitations of the crossover design of the parent study, it is not possible to attribute long-term improvements in psychiatric and existential distress directly to psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The majority of participants met criteria for an adjustment disorder (on the DSM-IV-TR) relative to cancer-related stressors at enrollment, and 71% reported entering partial or complete cancer remission at the second LTFU. Participants may have thus experienced naturalistic or spontaneous diminishment of distress and resolution of Participants adjustment disorders as Participants entered remission and approached the five-year cancer survival threshold. It is also possible that other psychiatric interventions received after the end of the parent trial accounted for improvements in depressive or anxious symptoms. However, this possibility is less likely given that in the follow-up assessment period only 8% of participants reported receiving any psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy specifically targeting cancer-related psychiatric distress These findings have meaningful implications for the clinical management of cancer-related existential distress. It is hopeful to consider the possibility that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy could represent the first empirically-driven pharmacotherapy intervention to treat this indication. Existential distress is under-recognized and under-treated in cancer patients within Western medicine (Cepoiu et al., 2008; Gouveia et al., 2015). Among medical illnesses, depression and hopelessness associated with a diagnosis of cancer can serve as severe stressors and are well-known risk factors for suicidal ideation and completed suicides (Rosenfeld et al., 2011; Breitbart et al., 2000). The potential rapidity and long-term durability of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy’s effects represents a promising protective strategy against suicides. Future trials should carefully explore this application with cancer populations with chronic, passive suicidality, as there is preliminary evidence that psychedelic use may prevent suicidal ideation and behaviors (Hendricks et al., 2015; Johansen and Krebs, 2015) An intriguing finding from our analyses was that the greater amount of time that had passed between participants’ psilocybin session and the second LTFU predicted stronger reductions in subjective reports of depression and hopelessness during this period. The significance of this finding is unclear. However, it is interesting to consider that certain domains of cancer-related distress, particularly certain key domains of existential distress, could continue to improve rather than diminish over time in relation to a single psilocybin session. The extended follow-up is an important strength of this study as the vast majority of psycho-oncology RCTs to treat psychological distress report a follow-up period of typically no more than one year following treatment (Faller et al., 2013; Gasser et al., 2015; Stagl et al., 2015) If it were established that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy effectively treats cancer-related psychiatric and existential distress, it would be important to understand the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms of action. In our previous report, the psilocybin-facilitated mystical-type experience was found to partially mediate the effect of dose sequence on anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy prior to the crossover, suggesting that acute aspects of participants’ subjective experience may explain changes in psychiatric outcomes up to seven weeks (Ross et al., 2016). In the present study, a mystical-type experience was not associated with long-term changes at the LTFU points. A reduction in power might have weakened our ability to detect an effect as the sample size in this LTFU study was reduced by 50%. It is also possible that the mystical-type experience does not represent a significant psychological change mechanism accounting for psilocybin’s therapeutic effects, or that other aspects of participants’ experiences are more influential in determining longer-term response. However, given the growing body of evidence linking the intensity of the psilocybin-facilitated mystical-type experience to therapeutic improvements across a range of psychiatric and addictive disorders (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2016; Pahnke et al., 1969; Roseman et al., 2019; Ross et al., 2016), it is important to further explore this potential psychological mechanism of action in additional adequately-powered RCTs. it would also be important to explore other potential psychological change mechanisms of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in this patient population One such mechanism may relate to rapid and enduring shifts in cognition. Classic psychedelics offer a rapid means of dismantling habitual mental templates that, over time, may rigidify one’s attention and behavior—patterns that are associated with various psychiatric pathologies (Carhart-Harris, 2018; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019). Psychedelic-induced states of consciousness are, instead, associated with increases in trait openness and cognitive flexibility (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Kuypers et al., 2016). In an open-label trial of psilocybin in patients with treatment-resistant depression participants reported increased trait openness, with significant increases in the following sub-traits: “openness to values” (i.e. valuing open-mindedness and psychological flexibility) and “openness to actions” (i.e. readiness to try and engage in new activities; Erritzoe et al., 2018). Being open to novel and more constructive ways of thinking, feeling and behaving is one of the central goals of contemporary evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (Hayes et al., 2012)), and enhanced cognitive and psychological flexibility may constitute a psychological mechanism mediating psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy’s antidepressant and anxiolytic effects (Watts and Luoma, 2020). Further, given the link between enhanced mystical-type states and enduring increases in trait openness (MacLean et al., 2011), it is possible that certain features of the mystical-type state (e.g. dissolution of boundaries and feelings of unity) lead one to develop enduring increases in psychological flexibility when coupled with supportive psychotherapy. The psilocybin experience may have enabled participants to establish a new inner framework from which participants could flexibly avail participants of resources internally and in participants environment to cope with life stressors, particularly stressors associated with participants cancer diagnoses It is also possible that other aspects of the acute psilocybin experience, such as challenging (Barrett et al., 2016) or emotional breakthrough experiences (Roseman et al., 2019), are more influential in explaining long-term changes of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The resolution and integration of difficult emotions may be particularly relevant for clinical populations such as cancer patients, and such emotional processing may support the development of greater psychological flexibility and emotional regulation in the long-term (Lane et al., 2015). It would be important to assess these potential psychological change mechanisms in future trials that are adequately designed and powered. These theories are supported by a growing consensus that serotonin 2A signaling mediates functional shifts in connectivity in cortico-striato-thalmo-cortical pathways (Preller et al., 2019), increased entropy in the brain (Carhart-Harris, 2018), and disruption of activity within the default mode network, a brain system that is associated with self-referential information processing and mind-wandering (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017; Ly et al., 2018). These theories are also consistent with the quantitative (Ross et al., 2016) and qualitative (Belser et al., 2017; Swift et al., 2017) findings from the parent trial and the present study of highly memorable, meaningful, and spiritually significant effects attributed to the psilocybin experience. We strongly believe, however, that an isolated experience with psilocybin does not inherently confer therapeutic benefits. Rather, the development of an enduring therapeutic experience is contingent on contextual factors, such as the presence of skilled therapists or guides, which facilitate a larger psychotherapeutic process. It is, therefore, important to recognize that purely neurobiological interpretations regarding brain activity during acute phases of a psilocybin experience will not adequately capture the dynamics of a psychotherapeutic process that may unfold in the weeks or months thereafter, fostering enhanced meaning and greater well-being", "tokens": [{"text": "psilocybin", "start": 190, "end": 200,

responses to emotional faces were observed one day after treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Post-treatment increases in amygdala responses to fearful versus neutral faces were related to a successful clinical outcome one week later Importantly, the present findings are in contrast to observations of decreased amygdala responses after treatment with conventional antidepressants and particularly with SSRIs (Ma, 2015). It has been proposed that decreased amygdala responsiveness to negative emotional stimuli under SSRIs is a key component of SSRIs therapeutic action (Harmer et al., 2017), but the present study's findings suggest that this model does not extend to the therapeutic action of psilocybin for TRD (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) Observations of reduced amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli (Ma, 2015) and reduced behavioural response biases to negative stimuli with conventional antidepressants (Harmer et al., 2009) have been interpreted as evidence of a functional remediation, linked to the correcting of negative cognitive biases in depression. However, it is suggested that chronically-used antidepressants have a more generalised effect on emotional processing, moderating not just responsiveness to negative emotional stimuli, but emotional stimuli more broadly (Price et al., 2009). Focusing specifically on the amygdala, this structure is known to be generally sensitive to emotional salience, regardless of the emotional valence of the stimuli (Adolphs, 2010, Santos et al., 2011). It is possible that the notion that SSRIs have a selective action on amygdala responses to negative stimuli is fallible, and rather, SSRIs and related antidepressants have a more generalised muting influence on amygdala responses to emotionally salient stimuli. Relatedly, negative stimuli may be processed as especially salient, and thus be associated with greater amygdala responses – which are subsequently hyper-sensitive to intervention-led change Reduced amygdala responses to emotional stimuli after chronic antidepressant medication has been linked with activation of post-synaptic serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1ARs), which have an inhibitory action on pyramidal cell firing (Andrade, 2011) and are densely expressed in the amygdala. While this mechanism has a solid empirical basis (Cowen and Browning, 2015, Deakin and Graeff, 1991), there is no known mechanism to explain how 5-HT1AR-induced attenuation of amygdala responsiveness can selectively apply to negative stimuli, without simultaneously affecting the processing of positive stimuli of an equivalent salience. Indeed, there is evidence of blunting of positive mood with SSRIs (Price et al., 2009). Moreover the relative ineffectiveness of conventional serotonergic antidepressant medications to alleviate anhedonia may be explained by a generalised moderation of emotional responsiveness with these drugs (McCabe et al., 2010) We recently carried out a qualitative analysis of patient experiences from this clinical trial, asking patients whether psilocybin with psychological support has been effective for patients, and if so, how? Since the majority of patients reported improvements with the treatment, most answered in the affirmative and described a greater willingness to accept all emotions post-treatment (including negative ones). These effects were often contrasted with those of These effects previous depression treatments which These effects described as working to reinforce emotional avoidance and disconnection (Watts et al., 2017). Conversely, psilocybin was said to make emotional ‘confrontation’ more likely, and the accompanying psychological support helped patients achieve an emotional breakthrough (catharsis) and resolution (Eisner and Cohen, 1958, Gasser et al., 2014b). Consistently, recent work has suggested that overcoming challenging emotional phenomena under a psychedelic is predictive of better long-term mental health outcomes (Carbonaro et al., 2016) It is important to highlight an important discrepancy between the present results, observed post acutely in patients treated with psilocybin for major depression viewing emotional faces and those from a previous study in which amygdala responses to emotional stimuli (not faces) were assessed during the acute psilocybin ‘high’ in healthy individuals (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). This latter study reported unspecific decreases in right amygdala responses to negative and neutral stimuli under psilocybin, which, based on the aforementioned similarities with the action of conventional antidepressants, the authors interpreted as supporting an antidepressant action for psilocybin. We advise caution with this interpretation however, not least because We pre versus post resting-state fMRI findings suggest that post-acute changes in spontaneous brain function are very different if not antithetical to psilocybin's acute brain effects (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017). Moreover, findings of ‘attenuated responses’ with potent interventions may be explained by compromised task engagement. A consistent explanation has been used to account for apparent functional impairments in imaging studies of pathological states such as schizophrenia, i.e. impoverished responses are observed because patients do not properly engage with the task and its stimuli (Corbetta et al., 1990, Rees et al., 1997) It is important to acknowledge the limitations of the present study. It would be interesting to collect longer-term imaging data than the 1-day post treatment scanning point chosen here (e.g. one week and one month after treatment with psilocybin). If feasible, it would also be interesting to collect imaging data during the acute experience to see how this relates to post treatment brain changes. Future work may look to combine PET and fMRI to systematically address potential relationships between receptor densities and functional brain measures before and after treatment with psilocybin. The recruitment of a healthy control group, receiving the same interventions would also add value, as would the inclusion of a meaningful comparator condition such as psilocybin alone versus psilocybin in combination with psychological support, plus the same for placebo and perhaps an active pharmacological control, such as an SSRI and/or methylphenidate (Griffiths et al., 2006). As this study was not placebo controlled, the contribution of psilocybin with psychological support cannot be differentiated from psychological support and other aspects of the therapy. It would also be worthwhile to see if the present results extend to a less severe population of depressed patients, including those with less extensive histories of exposure to psychiatric medication Psilocybin represents a novel intervention for major depression that appears to be safe, rapid and potentially enduring in its antidepressant action. Furthermore, it is important to note that psilocybin's abuse potential is low (Johnson and Griffiths, 2017). The original rationale for using psychedelic (‘mind-revealing’) drugs as aides to psychotherapy was that they serve to dismantle psychological defences, allowing suppressed emotional material to surface, sometimes with cathartic effect (Eisner and Cohen, 1958, Gasser et al., 2014b, Grof et al., 2008). The present findings of increased amygdala responsiveness post psilocybin resonate with patients' descriptions of feeling emotionally re-connected and accepting after the treatment (Watts et al., 2017). The finding of a relationship between increased right amygdala responses to fearful > neutral faces post treatment and subsequent clinical improvements adds further endorsement to this interpretation. Future work is required to test the replicability of these findings and test whether enhanced amygdala responsiveness is related to the potentially enduring positive mood effects of psychedelics (Griffiths et al., 2006, Schmid and Liechti, 2017). If confirmed, this would suggest an alternative neurobiological basis to the alleviation of depressive symptoms distinct from that of the SSRI antidepressants (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) ““I felt so much lighter, like something had been released, it was an emotional purging, the weight and anxiety and depression had been lifted.” “ “I have felt a sense of acceptance; more acceptance of agony, boredom, loneliness. [A] willingness to try to accept the negative times - but also an appreciation of the wonderful times.”", "tokens": [{"text": "psilocybin", "start": 91, "end": 101, "token_start": 13, "token_end": 13,

lab-based clinical intervention studies. We investigated psychedelic microdosing in online communities and tested pre-registered hypotheses (https://osf.io/ke49d/) concerning the relationship between experience with microdosing and various mental health and personality variables. Our results suggest a beneficial relationship wherein experience with microdosing is associated with lower dysfunctional attitudes and negative emotionality and higher wisdom, open-mindedness, and creativity. The most popular substances used to microdose were LSD and psilocybin, and no significant differences were found based on substance choice. Hypotheses predicting perceived importance of microdosing from dose-related practices were unsupported and optimal dose scheduling remains an open question. Exploratory analyses revealed that microdosers, especially current microdosers, had more positive emotional valence than nonmicrodosers, whereas emotional intensity was not significantly different. Taken together, these findings suggest that randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of microdosing are warranted to investigate the causal efficacy of microdosing. Consistent with our hypotheses, microdosing experience was associated with meaningfully lower levels of dysfunctional attitudes. Individuals with higher dysfunctional attitudes maintain a set of disadvantageous beliefs that increase vulnerability to stressors (Jarrett et al., 2012) and high scores are associated with depression (Adler et al., 2015; de Graaf et al., 2009). Also consistent with our hypotheses was the lower negative emotionality seen in microdosers, though the estimated effect was less precise. Tendencies to experience negative emotionality (e.g. anxiety, depression, emotional volatility) are a robust predictor of mental and physical health problems (Lahey, 2009) thus reduced vulnerability is reflected in the lower scores seen in microdosers. Exploratory analysis revealed that microdosers had more positive emotional valence than non-microdosers, linking microdosing to better mood states. While causation cannot be inferred from these results, significant differences were preserved even after controlling for potent covariates, such as gender and history of mental illness, indicating a potentially distinct contribution of microdosing on mental health vulnerability that warrants further study. Microdosers also had higher wisdom, which is a complex trait (BWSS, Glück et al., 2013). As measured by the BWSS, wisdom is understood to reflect learning from one's mistakes, considering multiple perspectives when facing a situation, being in tune with one's own emotions and the emotions of others, and feeling a sense of connection and unity. Higher scores, as seen in this sample of microdosers, may be associated with cognitive and emotional processing differences including enhanced capacity for perspective taking, resilience in the face of the vicissitudes of life, and increased feelings of engagement and connection. RCT research addressing the relationship between wisdom and microdosing are warranted. Greater open-mindedness was expected in microdosers compared to controls due to previous studies noting increases in openness following a full-dose of psilocybin (MacLean, Johnson, & Griffiths, 2011). These differences were supported, though this effect was relatively weaker than the others. Still, given the findings from full-dose psychedelic studies, future clinical intervention research should continue investigating any causal relationship between openmindedness and microdosing. Microdosers were more creative when finding unusual uses for household items. This is consistent with Fredrickson's (2004) Broaden and Build theory, which suggests a positive relationship between creativity and positive affect, which was also seen in microdosers. Happier, more creative people may be more likely to apply novel modes of thinking in more creative people personal and interpersonal challenges (Fredrickson, 2004). Our findings are also consistent with the anecdotal reports that a relationship between microdosing, creativity, and mood exists, but RCTs, ideally with multiple creativity measures, are required. None of Our hypotheses concerning the importance of microdosing benefits and microdosing practices were supported. It is likely that this measure was not sensitive and specific enough; planned analyses of qualitative benefits and drawbacks of microdosing will be explored in a separate report (Anderson et al., 2018). It may be that microdosing frequency is truly unrelated to the subjective valuation of microdosing, but this seems improbable. We suggest that this research question is best addressed in RCT studies focused on specific benefits with experimental manipulation of dose and schedule to determine optimal benefit-specific protocols. Similarly, there is no evidence that outcomes are predicated on prior experience with substances, whether full-dose psychedelics or with a variety of substances. More microdosers had experience with full-doses (69%, n=412) then did not (31%, n=182) and many microdosers (and nonmicrodosers) had experience with full-dose psychedelics within the month prior to completing the survey. As full-dose psychedelics can have benefits lasting at least a month (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017) this covariate should be formally modelled in future microdosing research designs, which should aim to include both psychedelic-naïve and psychedelic-experienced participants.", "tokens": [{"text": "microdosing", "start": 451, "end": 462, "token_start": 62, "token_end": 62, "entityLabel": "DRUG"},

of very low ‘microdoses’ of LSD on mood, cognition, and behavior in healthy young adult volunteers, and identified the threshold doses at which LSD produces detectable subjective effects. We report that at doses one tenth to one twentieth those used recreationally (and more recently in therapeutic settings), LSD produces measurable modest increases in ratings of drug effects scales. At these doses, LSD also had subtle effects on behavioral tasks: tending to increase the number of attempted trials on a creativity task (the Remote Associates Test). This is the first controlled study to investigate the acute subjective and behavioral effects of microdoses of LSD using a placebo-controlled within subjects design in healthy young adult volunteers Doses of 13 and 26μg LSD produced measurable subjective and physiological effects. The effects were linearly dose-related across all three doses, and 26μg LSD significantly increased ratings of “feel drug,” “like drug,” “feel high,” and “dislike drug,” and scores on the ARCI-LSD scale and the Vigor scale on the POMS. Interestingly, the drug also produced dose-dependent alterations of consciousness as measured by the 5D-ASC, which had previously only been shown at 100-200 μg doses (42). Physiologically, the 26μg dose increased blood pressure, but did not significantly affect temperature or heart rate. Previous studies have shown that 200ug LSD increase heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature (23), but the present findings reveal the threshold dose at which LSD produces these effects. This profile of responses to very low doses of LSD extend our understanding of the basic pharmacology of the drug, and set the stage for future studies on the behavioral and physiological effects of repeated doses of LSD There is some evidence that higher doses of LSD combined with psychotherapy can have beneficial effects on mood. Case reports and studies from the 1950s and 1960s suggest that LSD may be effective in a clinical context (reviewed in 43), and recent studies are investigating 100-200 μg LSD in combination with psychotherapy for anxiety associated with life threatening illnesses (18). Our participants were healthy and without mood disturbances. It is possible that Our participants increased ratings of “Vigor” after 26 ug could contribute to beneficial effects for patients in a psychotherapy setting, but this remains to be established in patient samples. The items on the Vigor subscale of the POMS include such adjectives as “lively,” “active,” “energetic,” “cheerful,” “alert,” “full of pep,” “carefree,” and “vigorous.” Although some of these effects may fit with the reported mood effects of “microdosers” in the community setting, the effects of repeated microdoses of LSD in clinical populations of symptomatic volunteers remain to be determined While single larger doses of LSD have been shown to have beneficial effects on mood, few studies have examined smaller doses administered at regular intervals. In rodents, repeated low doses of psilocin and ketamine reduce anxiety-like behavior (44, 45) and enhance learning in animal models of depression (17). Anecdotal reports in humans suggest that repeated (every 3 days) ingestion of microdoses of LSD enhance mood and reduce ratings of depression (1). A recent survey of 98 regular microdosers suggested that the drug improved psychological functioning including reductions in depression and stress and lower distractibility (6). Although we did not detect effects of single doses on mood or depression, it remains to be determined whether anti-depressant effects would be detected in individuals who report significant levels of depression Although some previous studies have suggested improvements in cognition, these were not detected here on the DSST or N-back tasks. Few studies have assessed acute effects of LSD on cognition. In one recent study LSD (100 μg) significantly increased “cognitive bizarreness” (46), and in another study LSD (10 μg) altered time perception, resulting in the over-reproduction of temporal intervals greater than 2 seconds (30). One recent naturalistic, open-label (pre-post) study, microdosing psilocybin-containing truffles improved convergent and divergent thinking without affecting analytic cognition on two creativity tasks (31). Although we found that LSD marginally increased the number of attempted trials on a measure of creativity, overall we detected minimal effects on cognitive function Several previous studies using higher doses of LSD have shown acute effects on emotion processing. One study showed that LSD (100-200μg) impaired recognition of fearful facial expressions (25), and in an fMRI study LSD (100 μg) dampened amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex reactivity to fearful faces (47). Interestingly, greater reduction in amygdala response was related to greater subjective drug effects. In another recent study the 5HT1A/2A agonist, psilocybin, at a relatively higher dose (0.215mg/kg) reduced feelings of social rejection during Cyberball (48). We did not observe similar results in We sample, perhaps because of drug or dose differences. Finally, We showed that microdoses of LSD decrease positivity ratings of positive images. This finding was surprising, and went against We hypothesis that the drug, in light of reports of antidepressant effects, may positively bias responses to affective stimuli. One possible explanation for our results is that LSD reportedly enhances global connectivity in the brain, giving rise to the phenomenon of “ego dissolution,” or a weakening of the boundary between the self and the universe (49). This increased connectivity between normally distinct networks (defaul-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) may affect perception of valenced stimuli, leading subjects to rate “positive” images as less positive Our study had a number of strengths. Most notably, Our tested three doses of the drug, compared to placebo, under double-blind conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. The participants included men and women, who were free of other drugs or alcohol at the time of testing. Our allowed 7 days for drug clearance between the sessions. Our used standardized self-report questionnaires, emotion and cognitive tests and obtained physiological measures at regular intervals. Until now, the effects of these very low doses of LSD have been investigated mainly in naturalistic open-label studies and through surveys (6, 31, 50). Here we present a profile of the full range of responses to the acute doses of the drug, including subjective, behavioral, affective and cognitive, in healthy young adults. In line with the conclusions of (6), we conclude that the 13 μg dose would be optimal for a repeated dosing study, as a repeated dosing study produced minimal subjective, behavioral or physiological effects that might interfere with normal function. The findings form a basis for future studies investigating repeated doses and doses in clinical populations, to determine the empirical basis of the purported therapeutic affects reported by regular users of these drugs The effects of low doses of LSD should be investigated when the drug is administered repeatedly, and in individuals who report negative affect. Individuals who report microdosing in their everyday lives take the drug every 3-5 days, and it is possible that the beneficial effects emerge only after repeated administration. This could be because of subtle pharmacokinetic accumulation of the drug, or This could be because of pharmacodynamic neural adaptations that occur over days. An important aim for future research will be to collect pharmacokinetic data, extending existing data with higher doses (32). Regular users claim that the drug improves mood and cognition, which raises the possibility that Regular users normal mood and cognitive function were less than optimal before using the drug. Therefore, it is important to examine the effect of LSD, either in single doses or in repeated dosing regimens, in populations reporting clinical mood symptoms, such as anxiety or depression. Studies such as this, investigating the mood and cognitive effects of low doses of psychedelic drugs under controlled conditions will advance our understanding of the neural and behavioral processes underlying depressed mood, and could lead to new treatments", "tokens": [{"text": "LSD", "start": 358, "end": 361, "token_start": 64, "token_end": 64, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "increases in

psychedelics include the burden that Major hurdles facing research with psychedelics Schedule 1 status incurs and a lack of mainstream funding, and we suspect these things are related. The Schedule 1 status of psychedelics led to vastly increased regulations on research, associated costs, and damaging stigma that likely deterred governmental agencies, other reputable funding bodies, and companies from backing the relevant research. Before LSD was banned, the US NIH funded over 130 studies exploring the US NIH clinical utility; however, since the ban, the US NIH has funded none and until a few years ago, no company was committed to manufacturing medical grade psychedelics and thus procurement of the required drugs for clinical trials was almost impossible (Nutt, 2015) Nowadays, both COMPASS Pathways and Usona are making psilocybin at scale with others starting. Natural plant-based products such as ayahuasca, peyote, and magic mushrooms are now legal in some South American countries and are becoming decriminalized in a few US cities. Moreover, magic mushrooms could be legalized in the US state of Oregon later this year. Magic truffles, which contain the same active compound, are legal in the Netherlands, and this loophole, combined with a growing interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, has led to fast-growing industry in Dutch truffle retreats. Some finance journalists have begun predicting a “shroom boom” to rival the “green rush” seen with medicinal cannabis (Raphael, 2018). This escalating recreational use presents an opportunity to collect “Big Data” for educational and harm-reduction purposes, and we have set-up an online platform for doing this, called psychedelicsurvey.com It is possible to make new 5-HT2A receptor agonist ligands that would, at the time of synthesis, be outside national or UN Conventions. However, based on recent examples, the risk of them becoming restricted would be very high. In the UK, the ultra-restrictive 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act makes all novel psychoactive compounds illegal, and some of the newer 5-HT2A receptor agonists (e.g., the NBOMeS) have been found to be more toxic than the older ones, a situation similar to that seen with the growth of legal but more harmful synthetic cannabinoids Overall, it seems the best way forward to fostering research and therapeutic application is to press for a rescheduling of psychedelics with proven therapeutic utility, especially psilocybin. That psilocybin was made Schedule 1 (i.e., having no medical value) on the shirt-tails of politically motivated banning of LSD has had an immense negative effect on treatment and research (Nutt, 2015). A campaign to re-schedule psilocybin is now underway in the UK, led by the charity DrugScience.org.uk and has international, scientific support", "tokens": [], "relations": []},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_51_2021-12-28_12:51:39.1.txt", "document": "In this 6-week randomized trial comparing psilocybin with escitalopram in patients with long-standing, mild-to-severe depression, the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6 (the primary outcome) did not differ significantly between the trial groups. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram; however, the confidence intervals for the between-group differences were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and no conclusions can be drawn from these data. In both trial groups, the scores on the depression scales at week 6 were numerically lower than the baseline scores, but the absence of a placebo group in the trial limits conclusions about the effect of either agent alone. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups, and no serious adverse events occurred. The percentages of patients who had anxiety, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, or reduced emotional responsiveness were higher in the escitalopram group than in the psilocybin group.19 Four patients in the escitalopram group stopped taking Four patients in the escitalopram group daily capsules entirely, and 1 patient halved the dose because of perceived adverse events. No patient in the psilocybin group requested to cancel the second psilocybin dose. Three patients were unable to attend sessions to receive the second psilocybin dose owing to the Covid-19 lockdown (2 patients in the psilocybin group and 1 in the escitalopram group). The most common adverse event in the psilocybin group was transient headache reported within 24 hours after the day of psilocybin dosing. The incidence of headache was similar to those reported in previous studies of psilocybin Acute subjective effects of psilocybin relating to the psychedelic experience were not included as adverse events in our trial, because previous studies have suggested that those reported in previous studies of psilocybin Acute subjective effects of psilocybin relating to the psychedelic experience may have a mediating influence on positive outcomes.21 The altered quality of conscious experience typically induced by a 25-mg dose of psilocybin adds complexity to this treatment model, because this treatment model requires that psychological support be provided to patients during and after treatment sessions.15 This requirement informed this trial’s screening criteria that excluded patients with preexisting psychiatric conditions believed to be incompatible with the limited psychological support that could be made available within the trial. This exclusion criterion may have biased the trial sample toward patients who could receive psilocybin without unacceptable side effects. However, psychological support was provided for both groups in this trial, and it is possible that the adjunctive psychological support improved outcomes among those in the escitalopram group A limitation of the trial is the brief duration of escitalopram treatment, because this drug has a delayed therapeutic action on depression.22 Had the course of escitalopram been extended, it is possible that better efficacy would have been observed among the patients in the escitalopram group. Patients who received the 25-mg dose of psilocybin rated the intensity of acute subjective effects higher than patients who received the 1-mg dose (Fig. S7). We did not assess the effectiveness of blinding within each treatment group. It was assumed that the active comparator design would mitigate expectancy bias, but we cannot be confident that guessing of the trial-group assignment or biased expectations in favor of psilocybin did not influence the results. Although efforts were made to recruit patients by external referrals, most of the recruited volunteers referred the recruited volunteers, and many expressed a preference for psilocybin over escitalopram. This created a selected trial population and limits generalization of the results The patients in the trial were not from diverse ethnic or socioeconomic backgrounds. Strategies to improve recruitment of more diverse study populations are needed in studies of psilocybin for depression. Also, average symptom severity scores at baseline were in the range for moderate depression, thus limiting extrapolations to patients with severe depressive symptoms or treatment-resistant depression Psychedelic agents have been shown to enhance suggestibility,23 and treatment-resistant depression Psychedelic agents psychological effects are assumed to be context-dependent.24,25 In other words, the content and subjective quality of the psychedelic experience is influenced by a person’s memories, perceptions, and degree to which the environment is supportive at the time of administration of the agent. In a study in which various psychedelic compounds were administered to rats, the compounds were shown to increase dendritic arbor complexity, promote dendritic spine growth, and stimulate synapse formation in the rat cortex, mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism,26 all of which are forms of neuronal plasticity that may be related to the principle that responses to psychedelics are especially dependent on contextual conditions This trial comparing psilocybin with escitalopram in a selected group of patients showed that the change in scores for depression at 6 weeks did not differ significantly between the trial groups. Secondary outcomes mostly favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the confidence intervals for the between-group differences were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are needed to compare psilocybin with established treatments for depression.", "tokens": [{"text": "psilocybin", "start": 304, "end": 314, "token_start": 56, "token_end": 56,

effects of serotonergic hallucinogens in humans using neuroimaging methods. Neurochemical imaging studies [PET and SPECT] involving acute oral administration of mescaline, psilocybin, and ayahuasca suggest that these drugs induce excitatory effects in frontolateral/frontomedial cortex, medial temporal lobe, and amygdala – regions involved in self-awareness, cognitive functioning, memory and emotion processing. These results were consistent across studies. Furthermore, these studies were performed in separated laboratories and used different drugs and neuroimaging technics. Studies using fMRI and involving acute oral [ayahuasca] or intravenous [DMT, psilocybin, LSD] administration of serotonergic hallucinogens showed less consistent results. Most resting-state fMRI studies showed significant reductions in brain activation in the same regions where neurochemical imaging studies showed increased activation, as well as in other regions such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, and visual areas (Daumann et al., 2010, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015) According to Carhart-Harris et al. (2012a), the inconsistence between PET/SPECT and fMRI results could be related to the time-scales considered in the different techniques. Thus, the radiotracers used to measure blood perfusion/glucose metabolism have long half-lives [e.g., the radiotracer 18F FDG, used to measure glucose metabolism, has a half-life of 110 min], using much greater time-scales than fMRI measures. Therefore, phasic or short-term effects of psilocybin could show some compensating/rebound effect that is detected by PET or SPECT (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a) However, nonsignificant (Daumann et al., 2008, Speth et al., 2016), mixed (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014), and opposite (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) results were also reported in fMRI studies. Moreover, an active-task fMRI study reported significant increases in memory-related activations in the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, mid-cingulate cortex, pre-sensorimotor area, precuneus, subgenual cingulate cortex, temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, and visual and other sensory cortical areas after intravenous psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b), and another fMRI study using an imagery task showed that oral ayahuasca induced a significant activation in the primary visual area comparable to the activation levels of a natural image with the eyes open, and ayahuasca also activated the cuneus and lingual gyrus and parahippocampal, retrosplenial, and frontopolar cortices (de Araujo et al., 2012). Also, an fMRI study reported that oral psilocybin significantly attenuated right amygdala activation to both negative and neutral pictures and that this effect was significantly correlated with increases in positive mood (Kraehenmann et al., 2015a) Interpretation of functional connectivity results is even more difficult. Functional connectivity alterations in key hubs of the DMN were observed in several studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016, Lebedev et al., 2015, Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015, Kaelen et al., 2016), which partially corroborates the neuroanatomical substrates where PET/SPECT studies found alterations in blood perfusion/glucose metabolism. Moreover, functional connectivity studies reported increased coupling between cortical networks, suggesting an increased integration between cortical regions (de Araujo et al., 2012, Petri et al., 2014, Roseman et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Kaelen et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Furthermore, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex (Kraehenmann et al., 2015b), and the interaction between music and LSD increased parahippocampal cortex/visual cortex functional connectivity and parahippocampal cortex to visual cortex information flow (Kaelen et al., 2016) Regarding structural MRI studies, one study with regular ayahuasca users reported significant cortical thinning in mesotemporal and inferior frontal gyri, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior occipital gyrus; and increased thickening in precentral gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex (Bouso et al., 2015). Importantly, there was no evidence of increased psychopathology in the ayahuasca group, suggesting that the structural alterations were not associated with psychopathologies. Moreover, inverse correlations were found between changes in cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate cortex and age of onset of ayahuasca use, intensity of prior ayahuasca use, and “self-transcendence”/spirituality Another structural MRI study investigated SERT and 5-HT2A receptor binding in polydrug, hallucinogen-preferring users and found no effects regarding SERT values and a slight reduction on 5-HT2A receptor densities (Erritzoe et al., 2011). However, significant effects on 5-HT2A receptor densities were observed only when both group of MDMA/hallucinogens users were analyzed together, suggesting that part of this effect might be more related to MDMA than to serotonergic hallucinogens (Mueller et al., 2016). Moreover, regional decreases in neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding were of only 9% in the neocortex, and when two controls with very high 5-HT2A receptor binding values were excluded from the sample the difference between groups was no longer significant The reviewed human data is corroborated by several preclinical studies showing that administration of serotonergic hallucinogens induce genetic, neurochemical, and behavioral alterations in/associated with brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus [see for review Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Nichols, 2016]. A recent study in rats reported that acute ayahuasca administration was associated with decreased concentrations of glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA] in the amygdala, increased GABA levels in the hippocampus, and an increased utilization rate of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin in the amygdala (de Castro-Neto et al., 2013). In another recent study, prolonged [30 days] ayahuasca administration to rats interfered with emotional memory, a process involving the hippocampus and the amygdala (Favaro et al., 2015), and Pic-Taylor et al. (2015) administered ayahuasca to rats to investigate patterns of neuronal activation using c-fos marked neurons and found higher neuronal activation in the dorsal raphe nuclei, amygdaloid nucleus, and hippocampal formation after ayahuasca administration. A recent study showed that acute administration of psilocin [the active metabolite of psilocybin] significantly increased MRI signal in the rat hypothalamus, olfactory regions, amygdala, and other limbic regions, and also increased cerebral blood flow in the somatosensory cortex after sensorial stimuli. However, MRI signal decreases were observed in the cingulate, motor, and somatosensory cortices [among other regions], and the amplitude of neuronal responses [local field potentials] to sensory stimuli in the somatosensory cortex was also decreased, suggesting an altered relationship between evoked neuronal and haemodynamic response magnitudes (Spain et al., 2015) The results by Spain et al. (2015) are corroborated by a recent study in humans showing that psilocybin induced significant increases on BOLD signal variance and total spectral power in the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral hippocampi, while significant decreases were observed in local field potentials in the DMN, executive control, and dorsal attention networks (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014). executive control, and dorsal attention networks (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014) study by Spain et al. (2015) could help to explain, at least in part, the discrepancy between PET/SPECT findings of increased blood perfusion/glucose metabolism and fMRI results showing decreased cerebral blood flow. Moreover, neurophysiological studies in humans using electroencephalography [EEG] and MEG consistently show that serotonergic hallucinogens decrease the power of lower frequency oscillations [theta/alpha frequency range, <20 Hz], especially alpha oscillations [8–12 Hz], in key regions of the DMN such as the anterior/posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal region, which induces an excitatory effect (Riba et al., 2002, Riba et al., 2004, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Kometer et al., 2015, Valle et al., 2016) Although the neural effects of serotonergic hallucinogens may involve serotonergic [e.g., 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors] and non-serotonergic [e.g., dopaminergic and sigma receptors] neurotransmission, the agonist effect of these drugs on deep-layer pyramidal neurons rich in 5-HT2A receptors seem to be the main mechanism of action of these compounds (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Hintzen and Passie, 2010, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, Kometer et al., 2012, Kometer et al., 2013, Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Baumeister et al., 2014, Tylš et al., 2014, Halberstadt, 2015, Nichols, 2016, Valle et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Agonism at these receptors expressed in frontal and medial cortical areas produce altered synchronization of cortical activity (Riba et al., 2002, Riba et al., 2004, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Petri et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Valle et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), “disintegration” of network connectivity (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Lebedev et al., 2015, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), increased excitability of multimodal association hubs (Riba et al., 2004, Riba et al., 2006, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), and altered information flow (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Alonso et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Kaelen et al., 2016). These effects create a state of “expanded awareness”, “ego-dissolution”, and “unconstrained cognition” (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Petri et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016, Gallimore, 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Lebedev et al., 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016) Agonism at frontocortical 5-HT2A receptors also modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission and may increase the expression of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor [GDNF], thus enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis by increasing the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons (González-Maeso et al., 2008, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, Moreno et al., 2011, Moreno et al., 2013, Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Baumeister et al., 2014, Carbonaro et al., 2015, Halberstadt, 2015, Nichols, 2016) Interestingly, these effects seem to be the neural basis involved in the therapeutic potentials of these compounds. Preclinical and human research suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties (dos Santos et al., 2016a, dos Santos et al., 2016b, Nunes et al., 2016). Indeed, acute administration of DMT (Gillin, 1976, Strassman et al., 1994, Riba et al., 2015), psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, Studerus et al., 2011, Kometer et al., 2012, Kraehenmann et al., 2015a), LSD (Schmid et al., 2015), and ayahuasca (Osório et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016) is associated with increases in positive mood. Furthermore, the studies reviewed show that serotonergic hallucinogens decrease DMN activity, which is increased during rumination, an important depressive symptom. Together with decreases in amygdala activity (Kraehenmann et al., 2015a, Kraehenmann et al., 2015b), reduced DMN activity may be another possible mechanism involved in the antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of these drugs. Moreover, observational studies also suggest that psilocybin, LSD, and ayahuasca may have therapeutic potentials (Krebs and Johansen, 2013, Hendricks et al., 2014, Hendricks et al., 2015, Johansen and Krebs, 2015, dos Santos et al., 2016a, dos Santos et al., 2016b, Nunes et al., 2016) Psychological mechanisms also play a role in the therapeutic properties of these drugs, and appear to be related to neuroimaging findings. For instance, in the retrospective MRI study of long-term ayahuasca users, the ayahuasca group not only scored higher than controls in “self-transcendence”, but scores were negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate cortex (Bouso et al., 2015) “Self-transcendence” is a character dimension related to religiousness and spirituality, and the beneficial effects of serotonergic hallucinogens appear to be related to serotonergic hallucinogens ability to elicit religious/mystical experiences (Kurland et al., 1971, McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971, Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981, Grof, 2001, Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, Hintzen and Passie, 2010, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, MacLean et al., 2011, Krebs and Johansen, 2012, Baumeister et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, Majić et al., 2015). Indeed, psilocybin induced religious-like experiences in healthy volunteers, with sustained improvements in attitudes, mood, and personality (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, MacLean et al., 2011), and psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience, together with the overall intensity of the experience, were correlated with improvements in tobacco (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014, Johnson et al., 2014) and alcohol (Bogenschutz et al., 2015) dependence. Moreover, the religious-like effects of LSD were associated with sustained improvements in patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases (Gasser et al., 2014, Gasser et al., 2015). Interestingly, decreased DMN activity and decreased DMN-TPN inverse coupling were observed not only after administration of serotonergic hallucinogens, but also in meditation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, de Araujo et al., 2012) Taken together, the neuroimaging data reviewed suggests that serotonergic hallucinogens produce serotonergic hallucinogens effects by modulating brain areas associated with perception and emotion processing, executive functions, and other complex cognitive functions. Specifically, these group of compounds may induce acute increases in blood perfusion/glucose metabolism in prefrontal and limbic areas involved in the regulation of mood, interoception, cognition, and consciousness; decreases in reactivity of brain structures related to anxiety/fear processing such as the amygdala; and reduced brain activity in key regions of the DMN, involved in mind-wandering and self-awareness. Somehow, the altered state of consciousness produced by serotonergic hallucinogens appears to create a disruption of repetitive, rigid, and pathological patterns of negative thoughts and emotions, commonly observed in anxiety and mood disorders and in drug dependence, and this effect may be therapeutically relevant. Finally, long-term use of these drugs was also associated with cortical thickness alterations in important areas of the DMN, such as the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices A main limitation of the present systematic review is the inclusion of studies with small sample sizes, high degree of heterogeneity, and without placebo or control groups. Other important limitations include the variety of doses of the same compound used in different studies and the difficulty in accurately measuring drug dose/composition in retrospective studies However, despite these important limitations, the reviewed results suggest that the neural basis of the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens involve an agonist action of these drugs on 5-HT2A receptors expressed in deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the fronto-parieto-occipito-temporal cortex, involved in perception, memory, and emotion processing, cognitive functions, regulation of neurotrophic factors, and consciousness. Moreover, although the mechanisms of action responsible for the effects produced by serotonergic hallucinogens are not completely understood, the available evidence suggest that these drugs may not only improve our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, consciousness, and other complex topics, but may also have therapeutic uses in treatment-resistant patients with anxiety and mood disorders or drug dependence. Further development of neuroimaging techniques, better sample and drug delivery standardizations and the integration of data across neuroimaging modalities may extend progress in this important

"coreferenced_full_texts_40_2021-12-28_12:51:38.2.txt", "document": "In this paper, we determined the agonist-activated structure of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor coupled to this paper canonical transducer Gαq, compared this paper with inactive state structures stabilized by both the partial agonist LSD and the inverse agonist methiothepin, and identified key determinants essential for agonist actions and receptor-Gq coupling. Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of classical psychedelics including LSD, psilocin, mescaline, and various N-BOH analogs, the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of classical psychedelics including LSD, psilocin, mescaline, and various N-BOH analogs provide structural insights into the actions of psychedelics at the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of classical psychedelics including LSD, psilocin, mescaline, and various N-BOH analogs molecular target. Importantly, we also discovered that the specific interactions the 5-HT2A receptor achieves with Gq residues are essential for the apparently selective engagement of this receptor with Gq-family proteins in vitro Some of these findings contrast with predictions from a recent study utilizing chimeric Gα subunits that indicated that HTR2A interact efficiently with all of the 11 tested Gα subunits, albeit with low efficacy at Gαs (Inoue et al., 2019). However, the Gα subtypes in that study (Inoue et al., 2019) were created by replacing the terminal seven amino acids of Gq with the corresponding sequences from several other Gα subunits using the motif LXXXLX (where X = subtype selective sequences) (Inoue et al., 2019). Pertinent to this, we note that immediately prior to L353 is Q352 that is conserved among all of the chimeric G proteins employed in the study by Inoue et al. (2019). Here, we discovered that the Q352 cognate residue directly interacts with HTR2A TM6 residue N3176.29, and mutation of this residue abolishes the ability of HTR2A to activate Gq. We also point out that in the only other Gq-GPCR structure available, the same Q352 interacts directly with the TM5 residue R5.46 (Maeda et al., 2019). Importantly, using assays in which full-length heterotrimeric G proteins were used, we find that HTR2A productively couples weakly with only one Gi-family member, Gαz Relevant to these findings, we also found important interactions outside the α5 helix that are essential for HTR2A-Gq interactions. Thus, R132ICL2 interacts via an extended backbone interaction with N32 of the α-helical domain, and we further demonstrated via mutagenesis and functional assays that this interaction is essential for agonist-induced activation of Gq. This GPCR-Gq interaction is not seen in the M1-G11 structure, although R134ICL2 in M1 could weakly interact with the backbone carbonyl of R32 in Gq based on an examination of that prior structure. These results underscore suggestions made decades ago that the selectivity determinants for Gα subunits may not be entirely specified by reside in Gα subunits terminal 5–7 amino acids (Wess, 1997) We also discovered that a key hydrophobic residue essential for G protein coupling among various GPCRs—I181ICL2—when mutated, abolishes Gαq coupling while potentiating arrestin binding at HTR2A. This result was unexpected because there was no prior data with sufficiently high resolution of GPCR-arrestin complexes that could illuminate how the mutation of a single amino acid at the GPCR-Gα interface would switch the coupling of HTR2A from an unbiased to an arrestin-exclusive state. While this paper was in revision, however, a 3.3 Å resolution structure of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor complexed with human β-arrestin1 was reported (Lee et al., 2020). A comparison of this structure with the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (Rasmussen et al., 2011) and our HTR2A-Gq structure reveals that the cognate hydrophobic residue F139ICL2 in β2-AR interacts with the Gs α5-helix in a manner similar to HTR2A-Gq. In the β1 adrenergic receptor-Arrestin structure, by contrast, F147ICL2 is displaced upward where F147ICL2 would potentially clash with residues in the α5 helix of Gs (Figure 7I) and where F147ICL2 is engaged in no productive interactions. A similar relative lack of extensive engagement of this cognate residue with arrestins can be seen in the lower resolution muscarinic- and neurotensin-receptor arrestin complexes (Huang et al., 2020; Staus et al., 2020) (Figure 7J) This analysis provides a potential structural explanation for how loss of this hydrophobic interaction impairs Gq subunit coupling while preserving arrestin interaction—at least for HTR2A In addition to these fundamental insights into GPCR-Gq interactions, our findings have relevance for neuropsychiatric drug discovery. Psilocybin and LSD have emerged as potential therapeutics for a number of neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and cluster headaches (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Bogenschutz, 2013; Gasser et al., 2015; Sewell et al., 2006; Nutt et al., 2020). Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of psilocybin in humans (Kometer et al., 2013; Nutt et al., 2020), insights into the molecular details of both HTR2A ligand recognition and HTR2A-effector coupling are key to arriving at a molecular understanding of hallucinogen actions. Additionally, these studies will provide a framework for a structure-guided search to identify more selective and efficacious HTR2A agonists as potential innovative neuropsychiatric therapeutics as recently exemplified by us for other GPCRs (Lyu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017; Stein et al., 2020)", "tokens": [{"text": "psilocybin", "start": 5065, "end": 5075, "token_start": 942, "token_end": 942, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "HTR2A ligand recognition", "start": 5173, "end": 5197, "token_start": 968, "token_end": 970, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "HTR2A-effector coupling", "start": 5202, "end": 5225, "token_start": 972, "token_end": 975, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "HT2A receptor", "start": 376, "end": 389, "token_start": 64, "token_end": 65, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "actions of classical psychedelics", "start": 411, "end": 444, "token_start": 70, "token_end": 73, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}], "relations": [{"child": 968, "head": 942, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 972, "head": 942, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 70, "head": 64, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_39_2021-12-28_12:51:38.1.txt", "document": "In this systematic review, we identified 21 studies on the anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca and ayahuasca alkaloids that met we inclusion criteria. Despite the small number of studies and the high degree of heterogeneity among heterogeneity, the reported results consistently show that these compounds have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties. These findings will be discussed in detail below Research performed among ayahuasca consumers over the last 20 years shows that users of this substance do not exhibit symptoms of psychiatric disorders or neurocognitive problems, but instead show normal or better cognitive function, increased well-being and spirituality, and reduced psychopathology, including anxiety and depression symptoms.10-12,14,15,34-36 Moreover, DMT administration to healthy volunteers suggest that this tryptamine may have anxiolytic properties Studies in rodents have reported that the β-carbolines harmine and harmaline, as well as ayahuasca, produce anxiolytic or antidepressive effects. As harmaline acts as a MAO-A inhibitor,3,5 the anxiolytic effects of this compound22,23 could be theoretically explained by an enhancement of serotonin concentrations in the brain after MAO-A inhibition.37 Nevertheless, the mechanisms of action responsible for the anxiolytic and antidepressive properties of harmine and harmaline are not completely understood, and other non-serotonergic mechanisms could also be involved Specifically, the antidepressive effects of harmine are apparently independent of the antidepressive effects of harmine effects as a MAO-A inhibitor,3,5 and seem to be mediated by regulation of cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress,28-30 and modulation of BDNF, an endogenous protein involved in neuroplasticity and depressive symptoms.25-27 Harmine and harmaline also bind to 5-HT2A receptors.38-40 Since hallucinogens increase cortical glutamate levels following activation of 5-HT2A receptors, increasing the expression of BDNF in prefrontal areas,41 42-43 the agonist action of harmine and harmaline in this serotonergic receptor could also lead to increased BDNF levels A study suggested that the GABAA receptor could be involved in the antidepressive effects of harmine.24 Nevertheless, some studies suggest that harmine, harmaline, and THH display little affinity for benzodiazepine receptors Regarding DMT, there is evidence that 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists modulate emotional processing, reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increase positive mood. Interestingly, cortical expression of 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor is altered in post-mortem samples of depressed patients.43 Therapeutic drugs that are 5-HT1A receptor agonists produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects in animals and humans,37,43,44 and 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects in animals.45 46-47 Moreover, there is increasing evidence that anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with inflammatory processes, and 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists have anti-inflammatory properties Other 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also produce reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and increases in positive mood. In the mid-1950s and 1960s, several studies investigated the potential therapeutic use of psilocybin and LSD in the treatment of disorders such as neurosis and OCDs, and as an adjunctive therapy in the terminally ill.42,51 52 53 54 55-56 However, a definite conclusion regarding the potential beneficial effects of these compounds cannot be drawn from previous investigations, since many of these studies had important methodological limitations, such as lack of a control group or randomization, absence of double-blind/placebo-controlled designs, and limited follow-up data Recent studies reported that psilocybin produces anxiolytic effects in mice in the marble burying test, an animal model of OCD,57 and that LSD produced antidepressive-like effects and normalized learning behavior and hippocampal serotonin 5-HT2 signaling in a rat model of depression (olfactory bulbectomy) As previously reported, smoked DMT increased positive mood in healthy voluntters,6 and both psilocybin59 60 61 62-63 and LSD64 also increased positive mood in experimental studies in humans. Case reports56,65 66 67-68 and clinical trials69 suggest that psilocybin and LSD may be beneficial for patients with OCD. Moreover, psilocybin- and LSD-assisted psychotherapy has been shown to reduce anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in patients with anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases such as advanced-stage cancer The antidepressive properties of ayahuasca could also be related to alterations of cortical connectivity in the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain areas involved in introspection, meditative states, daydreaming, imagination, and mind-wandering. Depressive states are associated with increased rumination, a self-referential process that may become difficult to disengage and is associated with increased activity of the DMN, and acute ayahuasca administration (2.2 mL/kg of body weight) significantly reduced DMN activation.73 A recent study evaluated cortical thickness in 22 regular users of ayahuasca (average 5.3 years of continuous use; range: 2-13 years) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reported significant cortical thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key node of the DMN Regarding other serotonergic hallucinogens, a recent functional MRI (fMRI) study involving intravenous administration of psilocybin (2 mg) to 15 healthy volunteers reported significant decreased cerebral blood flow in several brain areas including the PCC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), another important component of the DMN.75 A subsequent study reported increased functional connectivity of the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN), involved in goal-directed attentional tasks.76 Since the DMN and TPN have opposite functions, the authors suggested that the subjective effects of hallucinogens, as well as psychotic and meditative states, could be caused by disruption of DMN-TPN functional connectivity. This disruption would obfuscate the separateness of internally and externally focused states, profoundly altering cognition, perceptions, emotions, and consciousness. However, no significant change was observed in DMN-TPN connectivity after acute ayahuasca administration. Thus, further studies are needed to better explore the subjective and therapeutic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens Animal and human studies suggest that ayahuasca and further studies alkaloids can produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects, which are probably mediated by agonist action on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors. These receptors are involved in emotional processing, regulation of BDNF brain levels, anti-inflammatory actions, and altered DMN functional connectivity. However, the mechanisms of action involved in these therapeutic effects are not completely understood, and, at least in the case of harmine, may include non-serotonergic mechanisms that regulate cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxidative stress Considering that the average time necessary for the onset of therapeutic action of commercially available antidepressants is 2 weeks,77 the fast antidepressant action of ayahuasca reported in our preliminary clinical trial is promising. Recently, our group increased the number of depressive patients receiving ayahuasca treatment and used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess regional cerebral blood flow after drug administration. Our results suggest similar positive effects as described in our pilot study In summary, the results of this systematic review suggest that ayahuasca and its alkaloids have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties. These results are supported by studies using rodent models of anxiety and depressive disorders, experimental studies in healthy volunteers, observational studies in ayahuasca consumers, and preliminary data from depressed patients Investigation of these compounds could provide new pharmacological treatments with fast-acting beneficial effects for patients with anxiety and depressive disorders. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings Limitations of the present review include the small number of studies, especially clinical trials, and the heterogeneity among reviewed reports. Furthermore, most evidence showing anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or its alkaloids comes from rodent studies. Thus, it is premature to extrapolate these results to humans until more research is conducted With the exception of a single pilot study, the human studies included in this review were mostly experimental and observational in nature. The experimental studies described had small sample sizes and were not designed to assess anxiolytic or antidepressive effect. An important limitation of observational studies with long-term ayahuasca consumers is that it is generally very hard to differentiate whether the improvements described are a consequence of the ingestion of ayahuasca or of joining a religious group, which can improve quality of life and well-being.79 Experimental and observational studies provide weak evidence of causality, and until more clinical trials are developed, the available evidence in humans must be considered preliminary Despite these limitations, the results showing anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca and ayahuasca alkaloids are relatively constant, and have been reported in rodents, healthy volunteers, and depressed patients", "tokens": [{"text": "5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists", "start": 2428, "end":

most abundant alkaloids in B. caapi and ayahuasca, and by harmol, the main metabolite of harmine in humans31. Using an in vitro model of adult neurogenesis, we found that all four β-carbolines stimulated the proliferation and migration of progenitor cells and promoted progenitor cells differentiation predominantly into neurons The four compounds tested effectively promoted proliferation, migration, and differentiation of progenitor cells obtained from the SVZ and the SGZ, the two main niches of adult neurogenesis in rodents. The β-carbolines increased the number and size of primary neurospheres, induced the loss of the neurospheres’ undifferentiated state, and promoted subsequent cell migration and differentiation mainly into a neuronal phenotype, as indicated by the positive expression of β-III-tubulin and MAP2, but also into astroglial cells. Taken together, these three effects indicate that B. caapi alkaloids have the capacity to regulate the expansion and fate of stem cell populations Analysis of the proliferation stage showed that all four β-carbolines increased the number and size of neurospheres, the number of Ki-67-stained cells, and the amounts of Ki-67 and PCNA protein as measured by Western blot. Our results for the effect of harmine on proliferation are in line with a previous study showing harmine-induced increase in mitosis in cultured chick embryo cells32, and in human neural progenitor cells33. To our knowledge, the effects of harmaline and THH on neurogenesis have not been studied before. While harmaline is only present in small amounts in B. caapi, THH is the second most abundant β-carboline in the plant4, 29. Additionally, THH shows more consistent plasma levels between individuals and studies than harmine, which is rapidly degraded to harmol when taken orally29, 34. The latter, formed in vivo by O-demethylation of the parent compound29, showed proliferative effects of similar magnitude to those of harmine Our results showed that B. caapi β-carbolines promoted cellular migration and differentiation, suggesting that these alkaloids not only act as mitogens for neural stem cells, but also modulate cellular fate. The largest effects on migration were observed for harmaline and THH. Increased migration capacity is relevant in certain conditions such as brain injury, where stem cell niches are far from the damaged area35,36,37. All tested compounds also promoted cellular differentiation. Neural stem cells are known to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes23, 24. The observed increases in Tuj-1 and MAP-2 protein expression indicated differentiation predominantly toward a neuronal phenotype. In the SVZ All tested compounds were equally expressed after each of the four treatments. However, in the SGZ harmine administration did not influence Tuj-1 levels, a marker of immature neurons, but significantly increased the expression of MAP-2, suggesting a larger impact on neuronal maturation All the above indicate that B. caapi β-carbolines facilitate neurogenesis at multiple levels. This capacity is of interest, since in pathological conditions the replacement of neurons may be optimized by acting simultaneously on various processes38, 39. The effect of the β-carbolines on cellular proliferation and differentiation is not unique to these compounds, having been observed for endogenous molecules such as leukotriene B440, BMPs41, the growth factors EGF/FGF242, and NGF/BDNF/bFGF43, and the transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b44. However, the fact that the β-carbolines also stimulated migration highlights the versatility of these exogenous compounds, as these exogenous compounds can promote the three processes involved in full adult neurogenesis A likely possible explanation for the observed effects of β-carbolines in neurogenesis is the increase in monoamine levels caused by MAO inhibition. With this said, we must acknowledge that the magnitude of the neurogenic effects was similar for the four compounds, despite harmol and THH being inhibitors that are between a hundred and a thousand times weaker than harmine or harmaline5. Moreover, the role of monoamines in neurogenesis is not fully understood. Knocking out the 5-HT1A receptor in mice impaired neurogenesis after fluoxetine but not after imipramine, indicating that neurogenesis was independent from elevated serotonin levels45. In another study, the authors reported the unexpected finding that serotonin depletion actually promoted hippocampal neurogenesis instead of decreasing it46. In a recent paper, harmine, but not the MAO inhibitor pargyline, stimulated proliferation of human neural progenitor cells in vitro 33. Harmine effects were mediated through inhibition of the DYRK1A kinase rather than through MAO inhibition. This opens the possibility that the β-carbolines tested here regulated stem cell fate via DYRK1A or other alternative mechanisms. To our knowledge, the inhibitory effects of harmaline, tetrahydroharmine and harmol on DYRK1A has not been examined. Other potential molecular targets for the neurogenic effects of small molecules include the modulation of the GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway 47, upregulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor48, increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor49; and glucocorticoid receptor activation50. Future studies should assess whether B. caapi β-carbolines interact with one or more of these pathway our findings have relevant therapeutic implications. The association between neurogenesis and anti-depressant activity is well documented45, 51. Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis reduces depression-like behaviors in animals51. Furthermore, clinically effective antidepressants stimulate neurogenesis, independent of clinically effective antidepressants chemical structure and mechanism of action. To cite a few examples, chronic treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine increases neurogenesis in rats52, 53, as does chronic treatment with the selective MAO-A inhibitor pirlindole53. The association between neurogenesis and antidepressant effect is not limited to rodents and pharmacological interventions. Electroconvulsive therapy in primates also stimulates proliferation of neural precursors in the hippocampus and primates differentiation into neurons54. Hippocampal neurogenesis appears to be necessary for antidepressant action. Irradiation of the SGZ of the hippocampus in mice prevents the neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine and imipramine In humans, two recent clinical studies have demonstrated rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects after a single ayahuasca dose in patients who did not respond to conventional treatment11, 12. The therapeutic potential of ayahuasca is an area of increasing research interest beyond depression55. Alterations in adult neurogenic niches have been associated with a number of pathologies affecting the central nervous system56,57,58,59. Stimulation of these niches is currently being investigated as a novel therapeutic strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders60,61,62. Regular ayahuasca use has been associated decreases in problematic alcohol, cocaine and opiate consumption, indicating anti-addiction properties for B. caapi preparations63, 64. These potential anti-addictive properties are particularly relevant if we acknowledge the notorious difficulty of treating substance use disorders. Drug-dependent patients not only show functional deficits in reward processing and cognitive control, but also structural alterations in brain gray and white matter Our study has a series of limitations that need to be acknowledged. Ayahuasca brews contain other active compounds that were not tested here. A popular version of ayahuasca in the USA and Europe contains DMT, a serotonergic psychedelic9. It is possible that DMT may have contributed to the antidepressant effects reported in clinical studies using ayahuasca11, 12. This contribution could be due to both brain plasticity mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation66 and to the profound psychological experiences induced by psychedelics67. While studying DMT in the neurogenesis model was not an objective of the present investigation, studying DMT in the neurogenesis model could be assessed in a future study, comparing studying DMT in the neurogenesis model with other 5-HT2A agonists such as psilocybin or LSD. Although several animal studies have already shown that harmine improves behavioral measures of depression17, 18, future studies could ideally test the four compounds assessed here for both in vivo neurogenesis and behavioral improvement. Finally, future research could also use positive controls to compare the potency of the B. caapi β-carbolines with that of other antidepressants, such as SSRIs and MAO inhibitors In conclusion, here we showed that the β-carboline alkaloids present in B. caapi, the plant source of the ayahuasca tea, promote neurogenesis in vitro by stimulating neural progenitor pool expansion, and by inducing cellular migration and differentiation into a neuronal phenotype. The stimulation of neurogenic niches in the adult brain may substantially contribute to the antidepressant effects reported for ayahuasca in recent clinical studies. The versatility and full neurogenic capacity of the B. caapi β-carbolines warrant further investigation of these compounds. these compounds ability to modulate brain plasticity indicates these

we hypothesize that the induction of synapse-related gene expression in key neuronal populations identified by molecular studies and the robust alterations observed in neural circuits by imaging studies are highly interrelated processes (Figure 2). The ability of psychedelic drugs, such as LSD and psilocybin, to cause disruption of established neural connectivity and the emergence of novel functional associations may underlie the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics in a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses [41]. The results of psychedelic research using animal models, such as the induction of specific synapse-associated genes, puts the human neuroimaging findings of markedly altered functional connectivity into a new context. Therefore, biomedical research into psychedelics should take on a more translational nature (Figure 3), in which reverse translation (or bedside to bench) plays a prominent role. Questions remain as to the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the response to psychedelic drugs. For example, why do different brain regions have different transcriptional responses in what appear to be the same cell type? What roles do interneurons and glia play in hallucinogenic behaviors? Investigators can therefore prioritize brain regions that are altered by psychedelic exposure in fMRI studies, such as the visual cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, to further elucidate what molecular and cellular mechanisms may underlie the broad network changes seen in those regions Clearly, many questions remain regarding the biology of these compounds and these compounds use in the clinic (see Outstanding Questions). Drug development in psychiatry has lagged dramatically behind other biomedical disciplines 72, 73, and many of the most commonly used psychiatric medications were discovered serendipitously and often also possess complex adverse effects. Therefore, given the promising results seen in early phase clinical trials with psychedelic drugs for the treatment of addiction, anxiety, and depression, the research community must validate the efficacy of these drugs in more rigorous trials to achieve a better understanding of these drugs mechanisms in the body", "tokens": [{"text": "psychedelics", "start": 786, "end": 798, "token_start": 126, "token_end": 126, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "translational nature", "start": 821, "end": 841, "token_start": 132, "token_end": 133, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "interneurons", "start": 1182, "end": 1194, "token_start": 196, "token_end": 196, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "hallucinogenic behaviors", "start": 1212, "end": 1236, "token_start": 201, "token_end": 202, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "glia", "start": 1199, "end": 1203, "token_start": 198, "token_end": 198, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "synapse-related gene expression", "start": 49, "end": 80, "token_start": 9, "token_end": 13, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "robust alterations observed in neural circuits", "start": 149, "end": 195, "token_start": 24, "token_end": 29, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "disruption of established neural connectivity", "start": 332, "end": 377, "token_start": 56, "token_end": 60, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "therapeutic efficacy", "start": 446, "end": 466, "token_start": 71, "token_end": 72, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "LSD", "start": 303, "end": 306, "token_start": 50, "token_end": 50, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "emergence of novel functional associations", "start": 386, "end": 428, "token_start": 63, "token_end": 67, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 311, "end": 321, "token_start": 52, "token_end": 52, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "psychedelics", "start": 470, "end": 482, "token_start": 74, "token_end": 74, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "psychiatric illnesses", "start": 504, "end": 525, "token_start": 80, "token_end": 81, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "exact cellular and molecular mechanisms", "start": 956, "end": 995, "token_start": 159, "token_end": 163, "entityLabel": "NEURAL MECHANISM/CORRELATE"}, {"text": "response to psychedelic drugs", "start": 1011, "end": 1040, "token_start": 166, "token_end": 169, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "commonly used psychiatric medications", "start": 1783, "end": 1820, "token_start": 293, "token_end": 296, "entityLabel": "ANTIDEPRESSANT_DRUG"}, {"text": "complex adverse effects", "start": 1876, "end": 1899, "token_start": 304, "token_end": 306, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psychedelic drugs", "start": 1981, "end": 1998, "token_start": 321, "token_end": 322, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "addiction", "start": 2020, "end": 2029, "token_start": 327, "token_end": 327, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "anxiety", "start": 2031, "end": 2038, "token_start": 329, "token_end": 329, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}, {"text": "depression", "start": 2044, "end": 2054, "token_start": 332, "token_end": 332, "entityLabel": "HEALTH CONDITION"}], "relations": [{"child": 132, "head": 126, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 201, "head": 196, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 201, "head": 198, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 24, "head": 9, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 71, "head": 56, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 63, "head": 50, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 63, "head": 52, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 56, "head": 50, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 56, "head": 52, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 80, "head": 74, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 166, "head": 159, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 304, "head": 293, "relationLabel": "THOUGHT TO CAUSE"}, {"child": 327, "head": 321, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 329, "head": 321, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 321, "head": 332, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_35_2021-12-28_12:51:37.9.txt", "document": "All 8 factors and other lines of evidence taken together indicate the profile of a substance that is characterized by some level of abuse potential and potential risks. However, the findings do not support placement more restrictively than Schedule IV. The current placement in Schedule I is presently necessitated by the absence of FDA approval for a psilocybin containing medicine and Schedule I is the only Schedule into which substances of abuse can be placed that do not have an approved medical indication. However, it is the opinion of the authors of this review that the original placement of psilocybin was the result of a substantial overestimation of the risk of harm and abuse potential. The CSA stipulates that Schedule I is for substances with a high potential for abuse, lack of therapeutic approval, and that cannot be used safely in medicine. History of use and available scientific data show that the first criterion is questionable, and the third criterion is likely not true. The second of these criteria can only be negated by FDA approval of a psilocybin-containing products, but at this point the data suggest that the potential therapeutic benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy are real, and of potential medical and public health significance Schedule placement is guided by an analysis of the 8 factors of the CSA that will be drafted by the FDA with input from NIDA. The 8-factor analysis contained in this review should be considered an abbreviated assessment of abuse potential as compared to what would be required by the FDA to accompany the submission of an NDA for approval of a psilocybin containing drug product. Furthermore, considerable additional study will yet be required to support the submission of a complete and reviewable NDA and an NDA abuse potential assessment. This will include at least one major phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety trial that includes assessments relevant to abuse potential, additional Phase 1 and/or 2 clinical studies, and possibly some animal testing (Calderon et al., 2017; Sellers et al., 2017). Thus data yet to be collected will influence the final scheduling proposal that will be made by the sponsor and, in turn by the FDA, NIDA, and DEA. Nonetheless, considerable data from animal self-administration and discrimination studies, and human abuse potential studies since the 1960s provide a substantial basis for the present preliminary evaluation. In contrast to Schedule III drugs and even to many drugs placed in Schedule IV, the reinforcing effects in preclinical studies are marginal. There is no clear evidence of physical dependence and withdrawal in preclinical or clinical studies, or among those who chronically used illicit products. Euphoriant effects can occur under limited circumstances but appear attenuated by dysphoric effects. The doses that pose a risk of acute poisoning death (“overdose”) appear to be approximately 1000 times the likely highest clinical dose to be marketed, psychological dependence resulting in daily use appears rare, and all major drug surveillance systems reviewed in Factors 4, 5, and 6 of this analysis indicate rates of abuse, emergency department reports, and treatment seeking in youth and adults that are substantially lower than are evident for many Schedule IV drugs. It is possible, of course that subsequent study with larger populations and different designs in animals and humans, would yield different outcomes, but this review suggests that psilocybin would be appropriately placed in Schedule IV of the CSA if the FDA approves a psilocybin NDA The authors of this review recognize that opinions in the general population may differ substantially as it is clear that there remains a legacy of fear regarding psychedelics since the 1960s. The role of the 8-factor analysis of the CSA is to bring science to bear to support the foundation for scheduling, implications for other aspects of scheduling which are based on much of the same data. In particular, this means the labeling that will be specific to the label section, Drug Abuse and Dependence (section 9 of the drug labeling), and warnings including the possible requirement of a Boxed Warning (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2017d). As with all approved drug products, determination of safe and effective by the FDA does not mean without risk, and the conclusion that the science does not support scheduling more restrictive than IV does not mean no abuse or dependence risk This analysis has implications for future research with psilocybin and for the possible development of related drugs. Perhaps most challenging and important is research to better understand the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and related drugs that can produce profound and very long lasting positive changes in mood and well-being in people who were resistant to standard care and approved medicines. Given the extent to which undertreated and treatment resistant mental and behavioral disorders, including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, remain serious problems at the personal and societal levels in the US and globally (Belouin and Henningfield, 2018), it could be concluded that the need for such research is urgent The dearth of therapeutic and mechanistic studies of psilocybin and other classic psychedelics over the past half-century does not stem from a lack of interest among psychologists, psychiatrists, pharmacologists and neuroscientists. Research has been and continues to be limited by the provisions of the CSA and the lack of prioritization of such research by potential federal funding agencies. As discussed elsewhere, the barriers to research imposed by Schedule I regulation are formidable and although they do not outright ban such research, the consequence has been that this area of science and potential clinical application has been greatly under-researched (Belouin and Henningfield, 2018; Nutt, 2015; Nutt et al., 2013; Scientific American Editors, 2014; Sinha, 2001; Spillane, 2004; Woodworth, 2011). Several of the key clinical studies have been primarily supported by private foundations rather than federal institutions such as NIH (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2016) The science of drug abuse potential assessment has evolved considerably in recent decades and this is evident in the FDA's 2017 guidance document, “Assessment of Abuse Potential of Drugs,” that summarizes research strategies, and methods and discusses how these can be brought to bear to provide the regulatory science foundation for drug scheduling decisions. The application of this scientific approach to further evaluate the abuse potential of psilocybin provides an example of how this area of regulatory science has the potential to facilitate innovative therapeutic breakthroughs by replacing fear and misinformation with scientifically based conclusions and facts", "tokens": [{"text": "risk of harm", "start": 666, "end": 678, "token_start": 114, "token_end": 116, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 601, "end": 611, "token_start": 104, "token_end": 104, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "abuse potential", "start": 683, "end": 698, "token_start": 118, "token_end": 119, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 1176, "end": 1186, "token_start": 208, "token_end": 208, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "potential therapeutic benefits", "start": 1142, "end": 1172, "token_start": 204, "token_end": 206, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "medical and public health significance", "start": 1231, "end": 1269, "token_start": 218, "token_end": 222, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "dysphoric effects", "start": 2808, "end": 2825, "token_start": 494, "token_end": 495, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "Euphoriant effects", "start": 2726, "end": 2744, "token_start": 483, "token_end": 484, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 3480, "end": 3490, "token_start": 613, "token_end": 613, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "rates of abuse", "start": 3139, "end": 3153, "token_start": 555, "token_end": 557, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "emergency department reports", "start": 3155, "end": 3183, "token_start": 559, "token_end": 561, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "treatment seeking in youth and adults", "start": 3189, "end": 3226, "token_start": 564, "token_end": 569, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psychedelics", "start": 3747, "end": 3759, "token_start": 658, "token_end": 658, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "legacy of fear", "start": 3722, "end": 3736, "token_start": 654, "token_end": 656, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 4693, "end": 4703, "token_start": 828, "token_end": 828, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "profound and very long lasting positive changes in mood and well-being", "start": 4739, "end": 4809, "token_start": 835, "token_end": 847, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "abuse potential", "start": 6677, "end": 6692, "token_start": 1183, "token_end": 1184, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 6696, "end": 6706, "token_start": 1186, "token_end": 1186, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "psilocybin", "start": 4531, "end": 4541, "token_start": 803, "token_end": 803, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "not mean no abuse or dependence risk", "start": 4438, "end": 4474, "token_start": 788, "token_end": 794, "entityLabel": "OUTCOME"}], "relations": [{"child": 104, "head": 114, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 104, "head": 118, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 204, "head": 208, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 218, "head": 208, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 483, "head": 494, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 555, "head": 613, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 559, "head": 613, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 564, "head": 613, "relationLabel": "NO RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN"}, {"child": 654, "head": 658, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 835, "head": 828, "relationLabel": "POSITIVELY IMPACTS"}, {"child": 1186, "head": 1183, "relationLabel": "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BETWEEN"}, {"child": 788, "head": 803, "relationLabel": "NEGATIVELY IMPACTS"}]},{"documentName": "coreferenced_full_texts_34_2021-12-28_12:51:37.9.txt", "document": "Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is a promising combination intervention for the treatment of psychological distress, psychiatric conditions, and “the betterment of well people” (Bob Jesse, cited in Pollan, 2015). Despite the resurgence in research using psilocybin in recent years, the psychological mechanisms of action involved in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are not yet well understood. Current theory regarding psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic mechanisms of action posits that the occasion of a mystical experience is the primary mediating factor leading to positive treatment outcomes. While the construct of a “complete mystical experience,” for example, as defined by exceeding a cutoff score on the Pahnke–Richards Mystical Experience Questionnaire (Griffiths et al., 2006) has been shown to be one mediator of positive outcomes in randomized controlled trials (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2008; MacLean et al., 2011), the findings of this study suggest a more complex topography. It is conceivable that a single mediating factor is insufficient to account for multilevel phenomena that carry cognitive, emotional, behavioral, psychodynamic, spiritual, existential, and/or experiential components of significance The current study appears to be the first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The findings of this study suggest that there are important relational, bodily, affective, and other aspects of participant experiences that may play critical roles. First, participants universally described deeply meaningful attachments to important family members and significant others. Relationships were woven throughout participant narratives, with themes of forgiveness of others, loved ones as spirit guides, the importance of narrating one’s experience with loved ones, and improved relationships posttreatment. In this way, the psilocybin experience may be conceived as relationally embedded. In many ways, this is unsurprising, given the important contributions of attachment theory (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 2014; Bowlby, 1980, 2005), relational theory (Mitchell, 1988; Wachtel, 2010), and interpersonal theory (Sullivan, 2013) to human development, which have yet to be thoroughly integrated into psychedelic research paradigms. Nearly all participants reported having an experience of love and joy, though these exalted experiences arose primarily through a specific human relationship with another person, whether it was a parent, child, or partner. As Anais Nin (1971) once wrote, “The personal, if it is deep enough, becomes universal, mythical, symbolic” (p. 153). These findings indicate that a relational theoretical framework may have utility in assessing the importance of transformed interpersonal and intrapsychic configurations occasioned by psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Second, the findings of the current study also suggest that embodiment, and especially alterations or transfigurations of normally felt embodied states, is a critical feature of participant experiences. Although participants did describe discarnate phenomena, some of the most compelling accounts spoke of bodily ejections of cancer and visions of accepting some of the most compelling accounts bodies. Participants described enhanced interoceptive awareness, somatic synesthetic experiences, and alterations to Participants sense of self as embodied beings. Despite a trend toward embodiment as a broad interpretative framework in the social and behavioral sciences (Csordas, 1994; Gibbs, 2005; Niedenthal, Barsalou, Winkielman, Krauth-Gruber, & Ric, 2005), subjectively experienced body states are not currently being assessed in clinical trials with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Third, slightly more than half of participants recounted acute reactions of fear, confusion, panic, or paranoia during the psilocybin dosage session. panic, or paranoia were transient processes, and no serious adverse events attributable to the study treatment occurred during the course of this trial. The findings presented here suggest that transient periods of distress, even intense experiences of fear and panic, can be well tolerated by study participants in a supportive therapeutic milieu. The development of a trusting therapeutic alliance between the participant and the study therapists before the psilocybin administration session, followed by adequate integration psychotherapy sessions afterward, provides a crucial supportive context. While a straightforward review may deem experiences of transient psychological distress as undesirable side effects, both participants and the research team came to understand these difficult experiences as part of a necessary and ultimately beneficial process. In the midst of fear and dysphoria, participants described how participants came to surrender or “let go,” leading from a defensive posture of emotional or psychological resistance to an accepting posture characterized by feelings of relief, wholeness, freedom, and affirmation. Through a collaborative interpretative process, our research team generated a variety of ways of labeling these transient phenomena, including the following: the shadow, the difficult struggle, the dark night of the soul, wrathful guardians of the gates of the mandala, ego death, heaven and hell, and existential collapse. Each offered certain advantages but also brought with Each unwanted baggage from the psychological, theological, and psychedelic traditions from which Each were borrowed. Such periods of transient distress may serve as a necessary “turning point” in an unfolding process, as feelings of fear, panic, and anxiety transmute into feelings of love, joy, and forgiveness Fourth, these findings indicate that psilocybin occasions a rich and complex range of human emotions. Participants described powerful and healing catharses suggesting an emotional trajectory. Participant affects have either not been assessed formally in clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, or the range of assessment is limited, as with the use of visual analogue scales assessing feelings of fear, paranoia, and joy (Turton et al., 2014). Our findings suggest that participants may emerge from this treatment having experienced profound emotional depths and expanded affective boundaries. Future research may evaluate cathartic release and the depth and breadth of affect states occasioned during psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Fifth, participant accounts reveal a colorful, even fantastical range of complex closed-eye visual phenomena. These visions are ideographically instantiated within subjective processes. These complex visualizations are not merely interesting scenes painted on the proscenium curtain of the theater of the mind. Rather, among study participants, these visions served as principle organizing motifs of subjective experience with multifold vectors (e.g., audiovisual, relational, autobiographical, spiritual, epistemological, ontological). Such visions were often deeply coded with layers of meaning by participants Sixth, study participants described lasting impacts to study participants quality of life, life priorities, and study participants sense of identity. During study participants psilocybin experiences, many participants “remembered” aspects of many participants that had been forgotten. many participants recovered a sense of what is most important and vital in many participants lives, such as being present in the moment or being kind to other people. Participants described feeling “reborn,” more expansive, more confident, more connected, and more alive. Participants described a feeling of empowerment and being “unstuck,” with resulting healthier behaviors. As two participants reported significant weight loss, future research regarding the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy as an intervention for obesity and eating disorders may be warranted A number of limitations to this study should be noted. The interview guide focused primarily on the participant experiences during the psilocybin dosage session rather than the preparatory and integration psychotherapy sessions, which we see as essential components. The timing of the interview poses certain concerns, as approximately half the sample were interviewed within 1 week following certain concerns second psilocybin dosage session, which allowed little time to review lasting impacts of certain concerns experiences but afforded at least one integration psychotherapy session to help consolidate memory and meaning. Conversely, as eight participants were interviewed at approximately 1-year follow-up, the clarity of eight participants recall regarding specific phenomenal experiences a year earlier may have been subject to distortion or clouding. Additionally, the current analysis does not formally address participant–therapist interactions or the nature of therapeutic action as experienced by the patients nor does the current analysis address the variety of experiences related to cancer, death, and spirituality reported by this cohort of cancer patients, which is documented in a subsequent article (Swift et al., 2017) This is perhaps the first qualitative study to explore the subjective inner texture of participant experiences of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The findings of the study support the conclusion that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is well accepted by participants and constitutes a promising intervention for the treatment of existential and psychological distress provoked by a cancer diagnosis. An IPA revealed a complex, multilevel set of processes. Participants experience this treatment as relationally embedded, physically embodied, affect laden, deeply meaningful, and biographically instantiated, with lasting impacts to Participants experience of Participants and the world. Future research is warranted to attend to these and other possible mediating factors in the design of clinical trials to better articulate psychological mechanisms of action and maximize therapeutic

"coreferenced_full_texts_33_2021-12-28_12:51:37.8.txt", "document": "The aim of the present study was to further investigate the psychological mechanisms underlying the ayahuasca experience, and specifically whether ayahuasca acutely affects creative thinking. The aim of the present study was shown that during the acute inebriation, ayahuasca caused a decrease in conventional convergent thinking and enhanced creative divergent thinking, as measured by the PCT. All dependent variables associated with the PLMT remained unaffected The ayahuasca-induced enhancement of divergent thinking could potentially be linked to the effects ayahuasca exerts on brain regions involved in creativity. Three core networks, i.e., the default mode network (DMN), including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortices, the central executive network (CEN), including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortices, and the salience network (SN), including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, interact during divergent thinking via corticostriatal-thalamocortical loops (Chávez-Eakle et al. 2007; de Manzano et al. 2010; Fink et al. 2009; Geyer and Vollenweider 2008; Jung et al. 2013; Pinho et al. 2015). The thalamus feeds information into the SN which in turn coordinates the other mentioned networks (Beaty et al. 2016; Uddin 2015). The SN monitors events occurring outside of the body as well as internal consciousness and is able to direct attention to whatever is more important at a certain moment in time. It is suggested that especially these shifts between these externally (CEN) and internally (DMN) oriented cognitive networks are very important in creative divergent thinking (Jung et al. 2013; Perlovsky and Levine 2012). Interestingly, previous research has shown that ayahuasca reduced thalamic gating of sensory and cognitive information (Riba et al. 2002). Taking into account the neuronal pathways previously described, this could lead to an increase in information fed into the salience network. Consistent with this line of thinking is the fact that Riba and colleagues (2006) showed an increase in blood perfusion in the SN after ayahuasca ingestion. Previously, other imaging studies with psychedelics also showed increased blood perfusion or a higher metabolic rate of glucose in the frontal and paralimbic areas during (e.g., anterior insula, anterior cingulate) psilocybin and mescaline (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 1999a, b; Hermle et al. 1992; Riba et al. 2006; Vollenweider et al. 1997). In addition, Alonso et al. (2015) found broad-band power decrements in the EEG signal after ayahuasca compared to placebo. Based on the knowledge about negative correlations between EEG and BOLD (Moosmann et al. 2003), this was interpreted as reflecting increased activation of areas involved in visual processing and in the cognitive-emotional processing anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area that is central to the SN Alonso et al. (2015) also showed a temporary induced disruption of neural hierarchies by ayahuasca, i.e., by reducing top-down control and increasing bottom-up information transfer in the human brain (Alonso et al. 2015). It was suggested that the higher excitability of posterior regions in combination with the loosening of the cognitive grip exerted by frontal regions responsible for executive control may underlie the associations and insights that emerge during the experience (Alonso et al. 2015). Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) also found other parts of these networks to be influenced by ayahuasca, i.e., Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) showed a decrement in the functional connectivity in parts of the DMN after ayahuasca ingestion (Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015). It was suggested that this could result in more cognitive flexibility and consequently potentially enhanced divergent thinking (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014). However, Petri et al. (2014) suggest that the picture is more complex as However, Petri et al showed that the brain does not become a random system after psilocybin administration but still has stable connections which are different from the placebo state and only present in the psychedelic state (Petri et al. 2014). Likewise, Roseman et al. (2014) showed an increase in between-network resting state functional connectivity under psilocybin across normally distinct brain networks (Roseman et al. 2014). This increased integration between cortical areas could give rise to more associations (Petri et al. 2014) and an increased influence of imagination on visual perception (Roseman et al. 2014). Still, the precise neurobiological underpinning of how psychedelics may enhance divergent creative thinking remains largely unknown, and further research is warranted Convergent thinking can be seen as the second phase in the creative thinking process, i.e., focused on narrowing possibilities to a workable solution after the ideas have been generated through divergent thinking (Hennessey and Amabile 2009). Studies have shown this phase to be associated with an increase in CEN activity (Sowden et al. 2015). In the present study, ayahuasca caused deterioration in convergent thinking. Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) found that ayahuasca only influenced activity in the DMN without changing the connection between DMN and CEN (Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015). The absence of ayahuasca enhancing effects on the CEN, together with the decrease in thalamic gating and loosened cognitive control described by Alonso and colleagues (2015), could explain the negative effect of ayahuasca on convergent thinking (Alonso et al. 2015). However, research with other psychedelics, e.g., psilocybin, showed an increase in functional connectivity between the DMN and the task-positive network or CEN (Carhart-Harris et al. 2013; Roseman et al. 2014) Ayahuasca selectively affected performance in the PCT and not in the PLMT. Anecdotal reports from participants suggest that the stimuli of the PCT elicited more novel thoughts due to their more complex and colorful nature. In contrast, the stimuli in the PLMT contrast were very simple black-and-white line drawings. The latter probably gave less input into the system involved in the generation of new ideas. Another point to be mentioned is the quasi-experimental design of this study which potentially limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this study. this study could be argued that because ayahuasca sessions always followed the baseline session, and as this study is known that ideas can get more creative over time (Beaty and Silvia 2012), a potential order effect could have influenced the results. However, besides the fact that parallel versions of tasks were used in a randomized order to counter potential order effects, the double dissociation, i.e., improvement of divergent thinking and impairment of convergent thinking, suggests that results were not subjected to the serial order effect Previously, it has been shown that the connection between divergent thinking and mood is particularly strong and positive (Baas et al. 2008; Davis 2009), i.e., more positive mood improves divergent thinking. In contrast, convergent thinking and mood are related in a negative way: more positive mood lowers convergent thinking. Mood of participants in the present study was generally very positive, which may have contributed to participants in the present study openness to creative ideas. Mood ratings were only taken after drinking ayahuasca and could not be compared to mood states before drinking; nonetheless, participants in the present study differed statistically from 0. In the future, placebo-controlled studies including measures of mood could test whether mood changes are a moderator in the effects of ayahuasca. Another point which could be addressed in future research is the usefulness of ideas generated in the divergent thinking task as this is part of the definition of divergent creative thinking. By including for example a task in which this quality can be assessed, e.g., the “alternate uses task,” this quality can be tested whether ayahuasca also improves this aspect of divergent thinking It would be interesting and important in the light of potential clinical applications of ayahuasca to investigate whether the effects are stable or also vary in time. It is known that ayahuasca induces an intense modified state of consciousness, starting between 35 and 40 min after administration and lasting approximately 4 h (Frecska et al. 2016). We showed that during this period, divergent thinking was enhanced and convergent thinking distorted. Soler et al. (2015) demonstrated that 24 h after ayahuasca intake, mindfulness-related capacities were enhanced (Soler et al. 2015). Mindfulness, a state of nonjudgmental, sustained, and alert awareness which improves people’s cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal functioning, has been shown to be linked with convergent thinking and less with divergent thinking (Lebuda et al. 2016). Based on these findings, it could be interesting to see whether convergent thinking is recovered 24 h after ayahuasca administration. It is suggested, based on a study of Bouso et al. (2008) on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in post-traumatic stress disorder, that the potential effect pattern of ayahuasca would make it suited for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. The increase in divergent thinking during the acute phase could help patients relive events, recalling various associations without feeling inhibited (Bouso et al. 2008; Frecska et al. 2012, 2016). The sub-acute effects could then be suited in a second, “integration” session in which patients discuss the experiences patients had on ayahuasca and find strategies that help patients cope with intensive emotions. Future studies should therefore not only focus on either the acute or sub-acute phase but also take both stages into account In the past decade, a renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics has emerged (Anderson 2012; McKenna 2004; Sessa and Johnson 2015). The present study has shown that ayahuasca promotes divergent thinking, an ability which has been shown to be an important aspect in cognitive therapy (Forgeard and Elstein 2014). the present study can therefore be suggested that ayahuasca possesses qualities that can promote a therapeutic process. However, since convergent thinking is also a critical aspect in therapy, and the current findings show that ayahuasca impairs this facet during the acute phase, future studies have to investigate whether this effect profile changes over time. Additional research utilizing a placebo-controlled experimental design, including additional creativity measures, is warranted, before results can be generalized.\n", "tokens": [{"text":

leads to a transient modified state of awareness characterized by introspection, visions, and autobiographic and emotional memories (Riba et al., 2001). Both naïve and regular ayahuasca users have described the experience as positive and valuable, and some individuals have reported health improvements associated with ayahuasca intake (Loizaga-Velder, 2013, Barbosa et al., 2009). Reports of decreased consumption of alcohol, cocaine and other addictive drugs are common in regular ayahuasca users (Fabregas et al., 2010, Thomas et al., 2013). Anecdotal data also suggest an antidepressant effect for ayahuasca (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2014, Schmid, 2014). These testimonies have stimulated research into the potential benefits of ayahuasca in the treatment of substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions The available literature examining the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca can be classified into three main groups. In a first group we find studies on the molecular mechanisms of ayahuasca alkaloids: receptor binding studies and in vitro assays, as well as pharmacological studies in animal models. This group of investigations has examined the mechanisms of action that could explain the psychotropic effects of ayahuasca and the beneficial effects described by users. The second group of studies includes case reports describing beneficial effects in psychiatric symptomatology. Disorders include substance use disorders, anxiety and depression. However, most of these papers provide information from few subjects usually taking ayahuasca in the context of a religious group. This confounding factor has raised doubts as to whether beneficial effects can be attributed exclusively to ayahuasca. The third and more recent group of reports includes case-control studies and open label trials with psychiatric inpatients. a first group constitute a step forward in terms of methodological rigor, but designs are still not ideal, as will be discussed below As mentioned in previous sections, ayahuasca is a complex mixture of alkaloids. Thus, the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in alkaloids therapeutic effects are numerous Agonism of DMT at the 5-HT2A receptor sites may already have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. This has been shown in animals using the selective agonist DOI (Masuda and Sugiyama, 2000, Nic Dhonnchadha et al., 2003). This possibility is supported by the success of recent therapeutic trials that have used various psychedelics which have the common feature of stimulating this receptor (Grob et al., 2011, Gasser et al., 2015). In addition to increased glutamatergic transmission and rapid electrophysiological changes, agonism at this level has been shown to stimulate BDNF release and neurogenesis (Baumeister et al., 2014). These slower secondary events may also play a role in the beneficial effects of 5-HT2A agonists The recently uncovered modulatory role of DMT at the orphan receptor sigma-1 receptor (S1R) (Fontanilla et al., 2009) could also be involved in the effects of ayahuasca. As discussed above, the SR1 is a chaperone receptor promoting neural plasticity. Long-term exposure to ayahuasca could potentially lead to neural changes mediated through this mechanism The pharmacology of the beta-carbolines can be directly associated with therapeutic effects in depression and anxiety. MAO inhibition is a known therapeutic approach to treat these disorders. All three major beta-carbolines, harmol, harmalol and tetrahydroharmol have MAO-inhibiting properties (Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977a). Additionally, THH is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977b). Inhibition of the serotonin transporter is the main pharmacological mechanism of many of the antidepressants currently used in clinical practice. Increased monoamine concentrations in the synapse following ayahuasca intake could contribute to the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of B. caapi preparations. Harmine is also known to inhibit DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A) in a potent and specific manner (Adayev et al., 2011). This kinase that affects neurite formation and maturation is up-regulated in Down Syndrome as a result of the trisomy (Mazur-Kolecka et al., 2012) Halpern et al. (2008) reported a remission of drug or alcohol abuse/dependence in an ayahuasca community sample (6.5 years average of membership). In another case series study (Thomas et al., 2013), the authors found statistically significant reductions in cocaine use after an ayahuasca-assisted therapy in a sample of members of a First Nations community in Canada with no prior experience with ayahuasca. the authors also reported improvements in mindfulness, empowerment, hopefulness, quality of life-outlook and quality of life-meaning. Similar effects on substance use were found in two case-control studies (Fabregas et al., 2010, Grob et al., 1996). Grob et al. (1996) reported remission of alcohol, depressive, or anxiety disorders and changes in behavior, attitude toward others and outlook on life in a 15 long-term sample of ayahuasca users, compared to 15 matched controls with no prior history of ayahuasca ingestion. Fabregas et al. (2010) reported an improvement in alcohol use and cessation of drug use (except cannabis) in two groups of jungle and urban-based ayahuasca users compared to non ayahuasca users. These findings were maintained at one-year follow-up. Other descriptive studies, such as observational pilot studies, reports and informal interviews (i. e. Bouso and Riba, 2014; Doering-Silveira et al., 2005; Labate et al., 2014), have presented preliminary evidence, suggesting a potential beneficial role for ayahuasca in the treatment of substance use disorders As regards anxiety and depression, Barbosa et al. (2005) reported reductions in associated symptomatology after a first consumption of ayahuasca in a sample of Santo Daime members. Santo Daime members also reported behavioral changes, such as increased assertivity, vivacity and joy in members of two groups of ayahuasca users: the União do Vegetal and the Santo Daime. A case-control study (dos Santos et al., 2007) used psychometric measures of anxiety, panic-like and hopelessness in regular (10 years) ayahuasca users, members of the Santo Daime. While under the acute effects of ayahuasca, participants scored lower on the scales for panic- and hopelessness-related states, but no modification of state- or trait-anxiety was reported following ayahuasca ingestion More recently, two open-label trials (Osorio et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016) evaluated the effects of a single dose of ayahuasca in psychiatric depressive inpatients. Osorio et al. (2015) observed statistically significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores (HAM-D, MADRS, and the Anxious-Depression subscale of the BPRS) between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after the administration. Furthermore, ayahuasca administration did not trigger episodes of mania or hypomania as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Neither did it lead to increases in the Thinking disorder subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). In a subsequent study by the same group (Sanches et al., 2016), the authors reported significant decreases in scores on the same depression scales (HAM-D, MADRS, BPRS- Anxious-Depression), from 80 min after administration to day 21. No effects were observed on the YMRS and Activation BPRS subscale. Nevertheless, the authors reported increases in dissociative symptoms as measured by the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). The study included a SPECT assessment that found increased blood perfusion in the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area, a series of brain regions related to the regulation of mood and emotional states.", "tokens": [{"text": "ayahuasca", "start": 26, "end": 35, "token_start": 5, "token_end": 5, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "transient modified state of awareness",

the present investigation demonstrate that AYA has significant and quite impressive acute antidepressive effects. Score reductions were observed in both the HAM-D and MADRS scales on D1 and D7, and these effects lasted for several days. It is noteworthy that these changes showed a profile that was very similar across volunteers, regardless of the prior level of depression, i.e., the severity of the current depressive episode. The antidepressant potential of AYA was previously demonstrated in a study that reported a decrease in hopelessness symptoms after acute AYA intake The average time necessary for the onset of therapeutic action of commercially available antidepressants is 2 weeks.3 Considering currently available medications, the fast antidepressant action of AYA is promising, as the fast antidepressant action of AYA may provide faster reductions in depressive symptoms. Moreover, the antidepressant effects of AYA alkaloids may inspire a new area of depression research. Interestingly, symptoms increased on D14 as measured by the HAM-D and MADRS scales, although a subsequent significant decrease occurred on D21 in both scales. Although increased, HAM-D scores still remained 45% below baseline values, but this difference was nonsignificant. On the other hand, MADRS scores on D14 were significantly increased The decreases and increases in depressive symptoms after AYA administration could reflect complex intracellular events that remain active after the acute effects of AYA have subsided. The acute antidepressive effects of ketamine, for instance, may be sustained for weeks to months and are associated with increased synaptogenesis and spine formation, which seem to be related with increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels.4,5 Studies conducted in rodents by our group and by others using doses of 10-15 mg/kg harmine have demonstrated antidepressive effects for this compound, which were associated with increases in BDNF levels. Furthermore, harmine, THH, and harmaline are potent natural, selective, reversible, and competitive inhibitors of the MAO enzyme, especially of the MAO-A subtype.9,36 THH acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well as an MAOI.9,37 Inhibition of both systems - MAO and serotonin reuptake - may result in elevated levels of brain serotonin and other monoamines, producing antidepressant effects. The statistically significant reductions in BPRS-AD scores from D1 to D21 suggest that AYA produced antidepressive and anxiolytic effects. A previous study reported decreased panic-related signs after acute AYA intake. AYA administration did not produce statistically significant sensory, cognitive, or affective modifications as assessed by the BPRS and YMRS scales. Although nonsignificant, in the present study these effects were observed during a period ranging from 80 to 140 min after AYA administration, which is the time point when the subjective effects of AYA are peaking, as are DMT plasma levels. The absence of statistically significant effects on BPRS-TD scores could be explained by the DMT concentration found in our AYA batch (0.08 mg/mL), which is lower than DMT doses used in previous studies that reported significant psychotropic effects of AYA (0.53 mg/mL DMT).9,12 The nonsignificant effects of AYA on the BPRS-TD subscale suggest that changes in sensory perception and thought content may not be essential for therapeutic effects. AYA was well tolerated by all patients, suggesting that AYA can be safely administered to depressed patients. This result corroborates previous studies reporting a good tolerability profile for AYA administration to healthy volunteers.8-12,15,25,39 In the present study, the psychoactive effects of AYA were considered by participants as mild and short-lived, corroborating the nonsignificant effect of AYA on the BPRS-TD subscale. The nonsignificant increases in blood pressure replicate previous findings in human studies suggesting that AYA produces moderate cardiovascular effects. Early academic research on classical hallucinogens was designed considering the powerful influences of set (psychological state) and setting (environment) on the effects of this class of substances.40 Considering this background, in the present study volunteers were kept as comfortable as possible, remaining seated in a recliner in a quiet, dimly lit room throughout the experimental session. Investigator interference was minimal, allowing patients to concentrate on the effects of AYA. This safe environment may have reduced the probability of dysphoric reactions Vomiting was the only adverse effect reported by volunteers (50%). Patients were informed before the experimental session that vomiting was a possible effect of AYA, as nausea and vomiting are the most frequently reported adverse effects in clinical trials of acute AYA administration.8-12,15,39 In the present study, vomiting apparently did not have a significant influence on the antidepressive effects of AYA. Patients did not consider this emetic effect to be a severe discomfort, a result that is in line with previous studies of acute AYA administration to healthy volunteers, which reported that most participants regarded most participants AYA experience as pleasant despite the occurrence of vomiting In future studies, it would be interesting to try to reduce the emetic effect of AYA by premedicating with an antiemetic. However, this possibility should be explored with caution, considering that AYA alkaloids could interact with antiemetic drugs. Another possibility could be to administer AYA in different formulations. Freeze-dried AYA appears to produce less vomiting than oral AYA.8,11,15,39 Interestingly, variable degrees of nausea, vomiting, and, occasionally, simultaneous diarrhea are common in AYA rituals. In these contexts, however, these purgative effects are considered positive and cleansing. Important limitations of the present open-label study include the small sample size, the absence of a systematic inquiry about side effects, and the lack of placebo and control groups. Although patients did not spontaneously report adverse effects other than vomiting, the lack of a systematic assessment of adverse effects may have reduced the likelihood of registering more subtle effects, such as impacts on cognition. Future studies should assess the possible adverse effects of AYA in clinical populations by using other subjective measures, such as visual analogue scales and other scales that measure hallucinogenic effects, and by exploring other variables that could be modified by AYA administration as reported in previous studies, such as neuropsychological, neurophysiological, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immunological parameters. Ideally, future studies involving AYA and depressed patients or other clinical populations should also be designed to include a control group. This group could receive a placebo, a comparator drug with an established therapeutic indication, or AYA preceded by pretreatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist to investigate possible mechanisms of action. Regarding the small number of patients, additional studies with larger sample sizes and using neuroimaging techniques (single photon emission tomography, SPECT) are underway in our laboratory. The aforementioned limitations should be considered taking into account the novelty of this research and this research preliminary nature. To our knowledge, the use of AYA in a controlled clinical setting in patients with current depression - or in any other clinical population - has never been investigated. Moreover, the results of the present study, although preliminary, are corroborated by mounting research showing antidepressive potentials for AYA alkaloids in nonhuman animals16-24 and in humans. Finally, the reported results may prompt novel research into substances with faster therapeutic actions than currently available pharmacological resources, thus making antidepressive treatment more effective. The findings of this preliminary study demonstrate the potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of AYA, effects that, importantly, have an earlier onset of action when compared to traditional antidepressants. These findings suggest that AYA may represent a powerful new substance for the treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, these results deserve careful analysis, given the inherent limitations of an uncontrolled, open-label study with a small sample size. Other studies are needed to replicate these preliminary observations and to test, for example, the most effective dose (or doses) of AYA and the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of AYA administration over a longer period of time.", "tokens": [{"text": "AYA", "start": 2498, "end": 2501, "token_start": 419, "token_end": 419, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "antidepressive and

significant and consistent outcomes. Psilocybin significantly decreased brain blood flow and venous oxygenation in a manner that correlated with venous oxygenation subjective effects, and significantly decreased the positive coupling of two key structural hubs (the mPFC and the PCC). Our use of fMRI to measure resting-state brain activity after a psychedelic is unique, and because the results are unexpected, the results require some explanation. The effect of psilocybin on resting-state brain activity has been measured before with PET and glucose metabolism (8). The fMRI studies reported here found a global increase in glucose metabolism after oral psilocybin, which is inconsistent with our fMRI results. One possible explanation for this discrepancy relates to the fact that the radiotracer used to measure glucose metabolism (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) has a long half-life (110 min). Thus, the effects of psilocybin, as measured by PET, are over much greater timescales than indexed by our fMRI measures. It is therefore possible that phasic or short-term effects of psilocybin show some rebound that is detected by longer-term changes in glucose metabolism. More direct measures of neural activity will help inform this hypothesis, but in support of the inference that psilocybin does decrease neural activity, direct recordings of cortical local field potentials (LFPs) in rats found broadband decreases in resting state LFP power after psilocybin infusion—including γ-power (9)—changes in which are known to correlate with changes in the BOLD signal (10). It has been commonly assumed that psychedelics work by increasing neural activity; however, our results put this into question. Psilocin is a mixed serotonin receptor agonist, but there is a general consensus that the characteristic subjective and behavioral effects of psychedelics are initiated via stimulation of serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 2A receptors (11). It is possible that the deactivations observed in the present studies were caused by stimulation of 5-HT receptors other than 5-HT2A; however, this seems unlikely given that the affinity of psychedelics for the 5-HT2A receptor correlates with the 5-HT2A receptor potency (12) and 5-HT2A antagonists block the subjective effects of psychedelics (13). There is a large body of preclinical evidence that stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors increases GABAergic transmission and pyramidal cell inhibition (14–21), which may explain the deactivations observed here (Figs. 2 and 4). fMRI studies with serotonergic compounds that stimulate other 5-HT receptors, such as the 5-HT2C (22) or (mainly) the 5-HT1A receptor (23), have not found comparable results to those shown here, and 5-HT2A receptors are present in high concentrations in the cortical regions that were significantly deactivated and decoupled after psilocybin (Table S2). Stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor increases excitation in the host cell by reducing outward potassium currents (24). Thus, if the 5-HT2A receptor did mediate the observed deactivations, then the 5-HT2A receptor may have been via 5-HT2A-induced excitation of fast-spiking interneurons terminating on pyramidal cells (e.g., ref. 24) or 5-HT2A-induced excitation of pyramidal cells projecting onto interneurons (25). Regardless of how these effects were initiated at the receptor level, it is necessary for us to offer a functional explanation for these effects. It is noteworthy that the regions which showed the most consistent deactivations after psilocybin (e.g., the PCC and mPFC) are also those that show disproportionately high activity under normal conditions (26). For example, metabolism in the PCC is ∼20% higher than most other brain regions (27), yet psilocybin decreased the PCC blood flow by up to 20% in some subjects. There is some mystery about the function of the PCC; the PCC large size, buffered location, and rich vasculature means that the PCC is well protected from damage. The high metabolic activity of the PCC and the default-mode network (DMN) with which is it associated (26) has led some to speculate about The high metabolic activity of the PCC and the default-mode network (DMN) with which is it associated (26) functional importance, positing a role in consciousness (28) and high-level constructs, such as the self (29) or “ego” (30, 31). Indeed, the DMN is known to be activated during self-referencing (28) and other high-level functions linked to the self-construct (27). Moreover, DMN regions are also known to host the highest number of cortico-cortical connections in the brain, making DMN regions important “connector hubs” (32). “connector hubs” (32) may be critical for efficient information transfer in the brain by allowing communication between different regions via the fewest number of connections (33). However, such an integrative function would confer a significant responsibility on these regions, which may explain why such an integrative function deactivation has such a profound effect on consciousness, as shown here. These results may have implications beyond explaining how psilocybin works in the brain by implying that the DMN is crucial for the maintenance of cognitive integration and constraint under normal conditions. This finding is consistent with Aldous Huxley's “reducing valve” metaphor (34) and Karl Friston's “free-energy principle” (35), which propose that the mind/brain works to constrain its experience of the world. The pharmaco-physiological interaction results were particularly intriguing, revealing significant decreases in the positive coupling between the PCC and mPFC after psilocybin. This result can be understood in terms of a regression of PCC activity on mPFC activity, in which the regression slope decreases. This finding can either be interpreted as a decrease in the (backward or top-down) connectivity from prefrontal to parietal regions or, equivalently, an increase in the reciprocal (forward or bottom-up) direction from parietal to prefrontal regions. This asymmetrical change in coupling, induced by psilocybin, is consistent with a reduction in the sensitivity of superficial pyramidal cells in the parietal region targeted by prefrontal afferents, which may or may not be associated with a compensatory increase in the influence of parietal regions on prefrontal activity. Whatever the underlying synaptic mechanisms, these results provide clear evidence for a perturbation in reciprocal coupling between these two association areas and speak to a rebalancing of hierarchical activity in distributed high-level modes. Finally, consistent with their history of use as adjuncts to psychotherapy, the idea has recently re-emerged that psychedelics may be useful in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders (36). It seems relevant therefore that activity in (37) and connectivity with (38) the mPFC is known to be elevated in depression and normalized after effective treatment (39). The mPFC was consistently deactivated by psilocybin (Fig. 4) and the magnitude of the deactivations correlated with the drug's subjective effects (Fig. 3). Depression has been characterized as an “overstable” state, in which cognition is rigidly pessimistic (39). Trait pessimism has been linked to deficient 5-HT2A receptor stimulation (40, 41), particularly in the mPFC (40), and mPFC hyperactivity has been linked to pathological brooding (42). Recent work has shown that psilocybin can increase subjective well-being (4) and trait openness (43) several months after an acute experience, and depression scores in terminal cancer patients were significantly decreased 6 mo after treatment with psilocybin (2). Our results suggest a biological mechanism for this: decreased mPFC activity via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. Further work is required to test this hypothesis and the putative utility of psilocybin in depression We also observed decreased CBF in the hypothalamus after psilocybin (Fig. 2), which may explain anecdotal reports that psychedelics reduce symptoms of cluster headaches (44). Increased hypothalamic CBF was observed during acute headache in cluster headache sufferers (45) and inhibition of the hypothalamus via direct electrical stimulation can provide therapeutic relief for this condition. To conclude, here we used an advanced and comprehensive fMRI protocol to image the brain effects of psilocybin. These studies offer the most detailed account to date on how the psychedelic state is produced in the brain. The results suggest decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's connector hubs, permitting an unconstrained style of cognition.", "tokens": [{"text": "Psilocybin", "start": 77, "end": 87,

"coreferenced_full_texts_5_2021-12-28_12:51:35.4.txt", "document": "In this open-label, single-arm pilot study, we sought to examine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to patients with treatment-resistant depression as a prelude to a larger randomised controlled trial. Our results support the view that, done with appropriate safeguards (eg, careful screening and adequate therapeutic support), psilocybin can be safely administered to this patient group.Because this was a small-scale feasibility study with an open-label design, strong inferences cannot be made about the treatment's therapeutic efficacy. However, the data do suggest that further research is warranted. The response rate to psilocybin was 67% (n=8) at 1 week after treatment (HAM-D and BDI), and seven of these eight patients also met criteria for remission. Moreover, 58% (n=7) of the patients maintained 58% (n=7) of the patients response for 3 months, and 42% (n=5) remained in remission. It is also worth noting that psilocybin has a favourable toxicity profile and is not associated with compulsive drug-seeking behaviours in animals or human beings. The side-effects that we noted were minor, and expected in light of previous studies of psilocybin.Spontaneous recovery in refractory depression is rare, and many of the patients in the present study reported having depression for much of the patients in the present study adult lives (mean estimated illness duration 17·8 years [SD 8]). Key questions for future research therefore should address why the therapeutic effect observed in the present study is so large, and if the therapeutic effect observed in the present study can be replicated when tighter experimental controls are introduced. Because the treatment in our study consisted of not just two psilocybin administrations but also psychological support before, during, and after these sessions, as well as a positive therapeutic environment for the sessions, the relative effects of these factors need to be determined, which can only be done by conducting further trials with appropriate control conditions. A logical next step would be to carry out a placebo-controlled randomised trial in which the level of therapist contact is consistent between conditions. This would enable any between-group differences in clinical outcomes to be attributed to psilocybin rather than the psychological support provided. However, a positive interaction between these variables seems likely, and inert placebo-based blinds are known to be ineffective in studies involving conspicuous experimental interventions, because patients can easily discern whether patients are in the active condition or not. Use of an active placebo for the control condition might therefore be worth considering. Additionally, randomised comparative efficacy trials (eg, with an optional crossover component) incorporating another treatment for refractory depression (eg, ketamine infusion) could also be explored. The magnitude and persistence of the antidepressant effects observed here are not incongruent with what has been observed previously with psilocybin in chronic psychiatric conditions. For example, 80% of long-term heavy tobacco smokers demonstrated abstinence from smoking 6 months after two treatment sessions with psilocybin. 18 Alcohol-dependent patients demonstrated significantly reduced drinking behaviours over 8 months after one or two psilocybin sessions. 19 Significantly decreased anxiety and depression scores were observed 3 and 6 months after a single dose of psilocybin in patients with anxiety related to end-stage cancer, 15 and improvements in wellbeing lasting for more than 1 year were observed in healthy individuals given a single dose of psilocybin. 8 Rapid and enduring decreases in depressive symptoms were also recently found in a small-scale feasibility trial involving the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca. It is important to consider the limitations of this pilot study; for example, although all patients showed some clinical improvements for at least 3 weeks after treatment, and no serious or unexpected adverse reactions were observed, enduring improvements beyond 3 weeks were not observed universally, and five of the 12 patients showed a degree of relapse at 3 months. One should be cautious of the potential for inflated effect sizes in early trials, particularly when the sample size is small. That all patients showed some improvement in all patients depressive symptoms for up to 3 weeks after treatment could be suggestive of an expectancy bias. It may also be relevant that most patients in this trial were self-referring and, thus, actively sought this treatment. Psychedelics are known to promote suggestibility, 28 which might have further enhanced positive outcomes. Future double-blind randomised controlled trials could address the role of expectancy and suggestibility by measuring and controlling these variables. For example, patients could be asked about patients pre-treatment expectations, suggestions could be controlled between conditions, and outcomes from self-referred patients could be compared with those from patients referred via clinicians. From a more pragmatic perspective, if expectancy or suggestibility are found to be influential in the context of psychedelic therapy, expectancy or suggestibility could be treated as exploitable components of the treatment model rather than confounding variables. Serotonergic antidepressants have been found to down-regulate the primary receptor target of psilocybin (the 5-HT 2A receptor) and attenuated subjective responses to psychedelics have previously been reported in individuals chronically medicated with serotonergic antidepressants. 29 Thus, patients may be required to withdraw from concurrent antidepressant medication before receiving psilocybin and this should only ever be done with care. In conclusion, we sought to assess the safety and tolerability of psilocybin plus psychological support in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. we findings support the feasibility of this approach and the magnitude and duration of the post-treatment reductions in symptom severity motivate further controlled research. Psilocybin has a novel pharmacological action in comparison with currently available treatments for depression (ie, 5-HT 2A receptor agonism) and thus could constitute a useful addition to available therapies for the treatment of depression.", "tokens": [{"text": "psilocybin", "start": 636, "end": 646, "token_start": 115, "token_end": 115, "entityLabel": "DRUG"}, {"text": "remission", "start":

research project were to establish feasibility and safety for a hallucinogen treatment model in patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Following discussion with federal and state regulatory agencies as well as hospital institutional review board and research committees, a modest 0.2-mg/kg psilocybin dose was chosen. Although not comparable to higher doses of hallucinogens administered in the past to severely ill patients, the dose used here was still believed capable of inducing an alteration of consciousness with potential therapeutic benefit while optimizing patient safety. Determining safe parameters with this novel treatment paradigm is critical to establishing a strong foundation for this field of study that would allow for future investigations. Consistent with previous research, we found no untoward cardiovascular sequelae in we subject population.19 Minor HR and BP elevations after psilocybin administration were evidence only of a mild sympathomimetic effect. Holter monitoring did not identify increased cardiac arrhythmias in comparison with niacin placebo, even in subjects who presented with some baseline cardiac arrhythmia. Niacin may acutely lower BP through vasodilation35 but had minimal effects on BP and HR in our subjects, except for a reduction in diastolic BP that was noted 1 hour after administration of niacin. This transient effect may have contributed to our detection of a significant psilocybin effect at that time but cannot explain the significant effects of psilocybin over the subsequent intervals because the initial niacin-induced reduction of diastolic BP did not persist. We also observed no adverse psychological effects from the treatment. All subjects tolerated the treatment sessions well, with no indication of severe anxiety or a “bad trip.” The fact that psilocybin produced only modest effects on the anxious ego dissolution scale of the 5D-ASC confirmed this conclusion. When hallucinogens were administered to patients with terminal cancer in the 1960s and early 1970s, the occurrence of a profound psychospiritual experience was correlated with therapeutic outcome.10,12 Such transcendent states of consciousness are usually associated with higher doses of hallucinogens, so our expectation of demonstrating efficacy was limited.21 Common themes reported by subjects included examining how Common illness had impacted Common lives, relationships with family and close friends, and sense of ontological security. In addition, subjects reported powerful empathic cathexis to close friends and family members and examined how subjects wished to address subjects limited life expectancy. In monthly follow-up discussions, subjects reflected on insights and new perspectives gained during subjects psilocybin treatment. However, the frequency of these reports was not quantified. Although past researchers reported more pronounced therapeutic effects with a higher-dose model, even the lower dose of psilocybin used in the current study gave some indication of therapeutic benefit in quantitative psychological evaluations. In particular, we found that the STAI trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a sustained reduction in anxiety that reached significance at the 1- and 3-month points after treatment. This reduction might reflect a reduced level of stress and anxiety over time. Although the state anxiety on the STAI showed a modest elevation at 6 months, the change was not statistically significant and might have resulted from the deteriorating medical status of most subjects over time. Mood also improved for 2 weeks after treatment with psilocybin, with sustained improvement on the BDI reaching significance at the 6-month follow-up point. The POMS scores also reflected improved mood 2 weeks after receiving psilocybin. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward positive outcome. With a larger cohort of subjects and use of a higher dose of psilocybin, it seems possible that significant results would be obtained on these measures. Compared with placebo sessions, POMS scores were elevated in subjects immediately prior to psilocybin administration. The reasons for this difference in POMS scores 1 day before administration are not entirely clear. Subject expectations were unlikely to have played a role in the elevation of the POMS scores on the day before treatment because the elevation occurred regardless of treatment order. The most likely explanation for the elevation of POMS scores prior to treatment with psilocybin may be that subject randomization was not complete with regard to this instrument. Nonetheless, POMS scores declined after administration of psilocybin in 11 of 12 subjects, suggesting that psilocybin produces mood-elevating effects that persist after the acute effects of the drug. Another focus of the study was the effect of a 0.2-mg/kg psilocybin dose on somatic symptoms, particularly pain perception. In contrast to previous investigations, we did not find robust reductions in pain perception or lessened need for narcotic pain medication. In the 2 weeks following experimental treatment sessions, several subjects reported lessened pain, whereas others did not. There was no apparent difference between subjects treated with psilocybin and those treated with placebo (data not shown). Although this modest dose of psilocybin was not observed to impact pain, given the impressive reports of earlier researchers,6 this measure would certainly be indicated for study with higher doses. Although we used a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the drug order was almost always apparent to subjects and investigators whether the treatment was psilocybin or placebo. In fact, one consistent subject critique of the study was that the placebo sessions were perceived as far less worthwhile than those with psilocybin. Many of the subjects suggested that future protocols provide the opportunity for a second psilocybin session several weeks after the first. The general consensus among subjects was that a follow-up experience with psilocybin would reinforce and extend the perceived therapeutic effects of the initial session. Future studies also will need to address the issue of controlling for a placebo effect that might otherwise be attributed to the active treatment. Given the subjects' grave prognosis and limited life expectancy, we decided to provide all subjects with an opportunity to experience the experimental medicine and to serve as all subjects own control. Although we believed that to be the ethical course to take, given the life circumstances subjects were encountering, the protocol design contains some inherent limitations. A better experimental design might incorporate an independent control group, receiving only either placebo treatment or a conventional psychopharmacological intervention. Although there is no question that the extensive attention paid to the subjects influenced outcomes, the unique qualities of the psilocybin experience in facilitating strong therapeutic bonds and ameliorating underlying psychological demoralization are important factors worthy of further exploration. Another limitation of this study was variability in the extent of contact with subjects after treatment. A minimum contact of 1 hour monthly was established, but variability in additional ad hoc communication depended on the needs and wishes of the subjects, some of whom were near death compared with others who were more functional. Despite the limitations, this study demonstrates that the careful and controlled use of psilocybin may provide an alternative model for the treatment of conditions that are often minimally responsive to conventional therapies, including the profound existential anxiety and despair that often accompany advanced-stage cancers. A recent review from the psilocybin research group at Johns Hopkins University describes the critical components necessary for ensuring subject safety in hallucinogen research.36 Taking into account these essential provisions for optimizing safety as well as adhering to strict ethical standards of conduct for treatment facilitators, the results provided herein indicate the safety and promise of continued investigations into the range of medical effects of hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin.", "tokens": [{"text": "psilocybin", "start": 939, "end": 949, "token_start": 147,
