Recent behavioural and neuroimaging data show that psychedelics modulate neural circuits that have been implicated in mood and affective disorders, and can reduce the clinical symptoms of these disorders. These findings raise the possibility that research into psychedelics might identify novel therapeutic mechanisms and approaches that are based on glutamate-driven neuroplasticity.","[Vollenweider, Franz X.; Kometer, Michael] Univ Hosp Psychiat, Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging Res Unit, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vollenweider, Franz X.] Univ Zurich, Sch Med, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Vollenweider, FX (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Psychiat, Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging Res Unit, Zurich, Switzerland.",vollen@bll.uzh.ch,,,Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation; Heffter Research Institute,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation (to F.

Stress-induced activation of dynorphin-KOR is well known to produce analgesia, and more recently, it has been implicated as a mediator of stress-induced responses including anxiety, depression, and reinstatement of drug seeking. Drugs selectively targeting specific KOR signaling pathways may prove potentially useful as therapeutic treatments for mood and addiction disorders. KOR is a member of the seven transmembrane spanning (7TM) G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. KOR activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins leads to G alpha i/o inhibition of adenylyl cyclase production of cAMP and releases G beta gamma, which modulates the conductances of Ca+2 and K+ channels. In addition, KOR agonists activate kinase cascades including G-protein coupled Receptor Kinases (GRK) and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family: ERK1/2, p38 and JNK. Recent pharmacological data suggests that GPCRs exist as dynamic, multi-conformational protein complexes that can be directed by specific ligands towards distinct signaling pathways. Ligand-induced conformations of KOR that evoke beta-arrestin-dependent p38 MAPK activation result in aversion; whereas ligand-induced conformations that activate JNK without activating arrestin produce long-lasting inactivation of KOR signaling. In this review, we discuss the current status of KOR signal transduction research and the data that support two novel hypotheses: (1) KOR selective partial agonists that do not efficiently activate p38 MAPK may be useful analgesics without producing the dysphoric or hallucinogenic effects of selective, highly efficacious KOR agonists and (2) KOR antagonists that do not activate JNK may be effective short-acting drugs that may promote stress-resilience.","[Bruchas, Michael R.; Chavkin, Charles] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Chavkin, C (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cchavkin@u.washington.edu,"Chavkin, Charles/G-2797-2010; Bruchas, Michael/G-7616-2012",,"National Institute on Drug Abuse U.S. Public Health ServiceUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)United States Public Health Service [DA25970, DA20570, DA25182]; Hope for Depression Research Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R21DA025970, K99DA025182, K05DA020570] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse U.S. Public Health Service Grants DA25970, DA20570, and DA25182 and the Hope for Depression Research Foundation.",,109,180,189,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JUN,2010,210,2,10.1007/s00213-010-1806-y,,,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,592XW,WOS:000277416300004,20401607,Green Accepted,,,21/12/21,Not classic psychedelic ,,TCN

In addition to endogenous 5-HT, several hallucinogens, antipsychotics, and antidepressants function by targeting 5-HT(2A)R5. Preclinical studies show that 5-HT2AR antagonists have antipsychotic and antidepressant properties, whereas agonist ligands possess cognition-enhancing and hallucinogenic properties. Abnormal 5-HT2AR activity is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders and conditions, including depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. In addition to its traditional activity as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), recent studies have defined novel operations of 5-HT(2A)R5. Here we review progress in the (1) receptor anatomy and biology: distribution, signaling, polymerization and allosteric modulation; and (2) receptor functions: learning and memory, hallucination and spatial cognition, and mental disorders. Based on the recent progress in basic research on the 5-HT2AR, it appears that post-training 5-HT2AR activation enhances non-spatial memory consolidation, while pre-training 5-HT2AR activation facilitates fear extinction. Further, the potential influence that 5-HT2AR-elicited visual hallucinations may have on visual cue (i.e., landmark) guided spatial cognition is discussed. We conclude that the development of selective 5-HT2AR modulators to target distinct signaling pathways and neural circuits represents a new possibility for treating emotional, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders.","[Zhang, Gongliang] Anhui Med Univ, Coll Basic Med, Hefei 230032, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gongliang] Florida Atlantic Univ, Charles E Schmidt Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Zhang, Gongliang; Stackman, Robert W., Jr.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Jupiter Life Sci Initiat, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Stackman, Robert W., Jr.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Charles E Schmidt Coll Sci, Dept Psychol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA","Zhang, GL (corresponding author), Anhui Med Univ, Coll Basic Med, 81 Meishan Rd, Hefei 230032, Anhui, Peoples R China.",gzhang@fau.edu; rstackma@fau.edu,"Stackman, Robert W./E-8685-2019","Stackman Jr, Robert/0000-0002-5950-046X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN 0630522]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH 086591]; Researcher of the Year award from the Division of Research at Florida Atlantic University; National Natural Science Foundation general projects from China [81271217, 81471161]; Ph.D. Start Fund from Anhui Medical University [XJ201405]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH086591] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This project was supported by the NSF (IBN 0630522) and NIH (MH 086591) and a Researcher of the Year award from the Division of Research at Florida Atlantic University to RS and National Natural Science Foundation general projects from China (81271217, 81471161), Ph.D. Start Fund from Anhui Medical University (XJ201405) to GZ.",,186,118,123,3,36,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-9812,,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

Limitations of the existing literature include small samples, subjective adherence measures, and inadequate control for potential confounders such as mental health and substance use, which have been consistently associated with poorer adherence. Methods: Individual-level data were pooled from 13 US-based studies employing electronic drug monitoring to assess adherence. Adherence was operationalized as percent of prescribed doses taken from the first 12 (monthly) waves of data in each study. Depression symptoms were aggregated from several widely used assessments, and substance use was operationalized as any use of cocaine/stimulants, heroin/opiates, ecstasy, hallucinogens, or sedatives in the 30-365 days preceding baseline. Results: The final analytic sample of 1809 participants ranged in age from 18 to 72 years and was 67% male. Participants were 53% African American, 14% Latino, and 34% White. In a logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, income, education, and site, race/ethnicity was significantly associated with adherence (P, 0.001) and persisted in a model that also controlled for depression and substance use (P < 0.001), with African Americans having significantly lower adherence than Latinos [odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, P = 0.04] and whites (OR = 0.60, P < 0.001). Adherence did not differ between whites and Latinos (OR = 0.84, P = 0.27). Conclusions: Racial/ethnic differences in demographics, depression, and substance abuse do not explain the lower level of antiretroviral therapy adherence in African Americans observed in our sample. Further research is needed to explain the persistent disparity and might examine factors such as mistrust of providers, health literacy, and inequities in the health care system.","[Simoni, Jane M.; Huh, David; Bangsberg, David R.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Wilson, Ira B.] Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Dept Hlth Serv Policy & Practice, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Shen, Jie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Dent, Div Publ Hlth & Community Dent, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Goggin, Kathy] Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Reynolds, Nancy R.] Yale Univ, Sch Nursing, New Haven, CT 06536 USA; [Remien, Robert H.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Rosen, Marc I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Bangsberg, David R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Liu, Honghu] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Div Publ Hlth & Community Dent, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Liu, Honghu] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA USA","Simoni, JM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Box 351525, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jsimoni@uw.edu,"Wilson, Ira/F-9190-2016","Wilson, Ira/0000-0002-0246-738X; Simoni, Jane/0000-0002-8711-1576; Shen, Jie/0000-0003-2187-2273; Huh, David/0000-0002-6357-4883","National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Office on AIDS [R01MH078773];  [R01DA11869];  [R01MH54907];  [R01NR04749];  [R01MH68197];  [R01DA13826];  [K23MH01862];  [R01MH01584];  [R01AI41413];  [R01 MH61173];  [NIH/NIAID AI38858];  [AI069419];  [K02DA017277];  [R01DA15215];  [NIMH P01MH49548];  [R01MH58986];  [R01MH61695];  [CC99-SD003];  [CC02-SD-003];  [R01DA015679]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U01AI069419, R01AI041413, U01AI038858, P30AI050410, UM1AI069419, P30AI027757] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K23MH001862, K24MH092242, R01MH058986, R01MH054907, P01MH049548, R01MH061695, R01MH061173, R01MH078773, R01MH068197, K24MH093243, K08MH001584, P30MH043520, R01MH083595] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [R01NR004749] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA011869, K02DA017277, R01DA015679, R01DA015215, R01DA013826] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Supported by the multisite adherence collaboration in HIV (MACH14) grant R01MH078773 from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Office on AIDS.

5,"Schankin, CJ; Maniyar, FH; Digre, KB; Goadsby, PJ","Schankin, Christoph J.; Maniyar, Farooq H.; Digre, Kathleen B.; Goadsby, Peter J.",'Visual snow' - a disorder distinct from persistent migraine aura,BRAIN,English,Article,visual snow; persistent migraine aura; flashback; migraine; positive persistent visual disturbance,PALINOPSIA; TINNITUS; CONTRAST; CORTEX,"Patients with 'visual snow' experience dots in their visual field resembling analogue TV noise. By studying a large cohort of patients, Schankin et al. reveal that visual snow is a unique syndrome distinct from migraine aura, despite its frequent comorbidity with migraine. Existing therapies are largely ineffective against visual snow.Patients with 'visual snow' report continuous tiny dots in the entire visual field similar to the noise of an analogue television. As they frequently have migraine as a comorbidity with ophthalmological, neurological and radiological studies being normal, they are offered various diagnoses, including persistent migraine aura, post-hallucinogen flashback, or psychogenic disorder. Our aim was to study patients with 'visual snow' to characterize the phenotype. A three-step approach was followed: (i) a chart review of patients referred to us identified 22 patients with 'visual snow'. Fifteen had additional visual symptoms, and 20 patients had comorbid migraine, five with aura; (ii) to identify systematically additional visual symptoms, an internet survey (n = 275) of self-assessed 'visual snow' subjects done by Eye On Vision Foundation was analysed. In two random samples from 235 complete data sets, the same eight additional visual symptoms were present in > 33% of patients: palinopsia (trailing and afterimages), entoptic phenomena (floaters, blue field entoptic phenomenon, spontaneous photopsia, self-light of the eye), photophobia, and nyctalopia (impaired night vision); and (iii) a prospective semi-structured telephone interview in a further 142 patients identified 78 (41 female) with confirmed 'visual snow' and normal ophthalmological exams. Of these, 72 had at least three of the additional visual symptoms from step (ii). One-quarter of patients had 'visual snow' as long as they could remember, whereas for the others the mean age of onset was 21 +/- 9 years. Thirty-two patients had constant visual symptoms, whereas the remainder experienced either progressive or stepwise worsening. Headache was the most frequent symptom associated with the beginning or a worsening of the visual disturbance (36%), whereas migraine aura (seven patients) and consumption of illicit drugs (five, no hallucinogens) were rare. Migraine (59%), migraine with aura (27%), anxiety and depression were common comorbidities over time. Eight patients had first degree relatives with visual snow. Clinical investigations were not contributory. Only a few treatment trials have been successful in individual patients. Our data suggest that 'visual snow' is a unique visual disturbance clinically distinct from migraine aura that can be disabling for patients. Migraine is a common concomitant although standard migraine treatments are often unhelpful. 'Visual snow' should be considered a distinct disorder and systematic studies of its clinical features, biology and treatment responses need to be commenced to begin to understand what has been an almost completely ignored problem.","[Schankin, Christoph J.; Maniyar, Farooq H.; Goadsby, Peter J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, Headache Grp, San Francisco, CA USA; [Schankin, Christoph J.; Maniyar, Farooq H.; Goadsby, Peter J.] Kings Coll London, NIHR Wellcome Trust Clin Res Facil, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Digre, Kathleen B.] Univ Utah, Dept Neurol, Moran Eye Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT USA","Goadsby, PJ (corresponding author), Kings Coll Hosp London, NIHR Wellcome Trust Clin Res Facil, London SE5 9PJ, England.",peter.goadsby@kcl.ac.uk,"Goadsby, Peter J/Z-1970-2019; Cusco, Xavier Garcia/S-7576-2019","Goadsby, Peter J/0000-0003-3260-5904; Cusco, Xavier Garcia/0000-0001-7199-6931","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHA 1676/1-1]; Research to Prevent Blindness, Inc., New York, New York, USAResearch to Prevent Blindness (RPB)","C.J.S. was supported by the German Research Foundation [SCHA 1676/1-1].

Although serotonin is the cognate endogenous neurotransmitter and is not considered hallucinogenic, metabolites of serotonin also have high affinity at 5-HT2AR and can induce hallucinations in humans. Here we report that serotonin differs from the psychoactive N-methyltryptamines by its ability to engage a beta-arrestin2-mediated signaling cascade in the frontal cortex. Serotonin and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) induce a head-twitch response in wild-type (WT) mice that is a behavioral proxy for 5-HT2AR activation. The response in beta-arrestin2 knock-out (beta arr2-KO) mice is greatly attenuated until the doses are elevated, at which point, beta arr2-KO mice display a head-twitch response that can exceed that of WT mice. Direct administration of N-methyltryptamines also produces a greater response in beta arr2-KO mice. Moreover, the inhibition of N-methyltransferase blocks 5-HTP-induced head twitches in beta arr2-KO mice, indicating that N-methyltryptamines, rather than serotonin, primarily mediate this response. Biochemical studies demonstrate that serotonin stimulates Akt phosphorylation in the frontal cortex and in primary cortical neurons through the activation of a beta-arrestin2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Src/Akt cascade, whereas N-methyltryptamines do not. Furthermore, disruption of any of the components of this cascade prevents 5-HTP-induced, but not N-methyltryptamine-induced, head twitches. We propose that there is a bifurcation of 5-HT2AR signaling that is neurotransmitter and beta-arrestin2 dependent. This demonstration of agonist-directed 5-HT2AR signaling in vivo may significantly impact drug discovery efforts for the treatment of disorders wherein hallucinations are part of the etiology, such as schizophrenia, or manifest as side effects of treatment, such as depression.","[Schmid, Cullen L.; Bohn, Laura M.] Scripps Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Schmid, Cullen L.] Ohio State Univ, Neurosci Grad Studies Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Bohn, LM (corresponding author), 130 Scripps Way,2A2, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",LBohn@scripps.edu,"Bohn, Laura M/A-7483-2014","Bohn, Laura M/0000-0002-6474-8179; Schmid Mason, Cullen/0000-0002-2882-1842",National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [DA025158]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA025158] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This work is funded by National Institute on Drug Abuse Grant DA025158 (L.

The serotonin 5-HT2A and the metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors both have been the target of considerable attention regarding schizophrenia and antipsychotic drug development. We tested the effects of maternal variable stress during pregnancy on expression and behavioral function of these two receptors in mice. Prenatal stress increased 5-HT2A and decreased mGlu2 expression in frontal cortex, a brain region involved in perception, cognition, and mood. This pattern of expression of 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors was consistent with behavioral alterations, including increased head-twitch response to the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonist DOI [ 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane] and decreased mGlu2-dependent antipsychotic-like effect of the mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268 (1R,4R,5S,6R-2-oxa-4-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylate) in adult, but not prepubertal, mice born to stressed mothers during pregnancy. Cross-fostering studies determined that these alterations were not attributable to effects of prenatal stress on maternal care. Additionally, a similar pattern of biochemical and behavioral changes were observed in mice born to mothers injected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I: C)] during pregnancy as a model of prenatal immune activation. These data strengthen pathophysiological hypotheses that propose an early neurodevelopmental origin for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.","[Holloway, Terrell; Moreno, Jose L.; Umali, Adrienne; Rayannavar, Vinayak; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Hodes, Georgia E.; Russo, Scott J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Russo, Scott J.; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA","Gonzalez-Maeso, J (corresponding author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 1425 Madison Ave,Box 1229, New York, NY 10029 USA.",Javier.Maeso@mssm.edu,"Hodes, Georgia/L-8022-2016; Russo, Scott/R-7107-2019; Moreno, Jose L/L-8981-2017","Hodes, Georgia/0000-0002-1551-2178; Russo, Scott/0000-0002-6470-1805; ","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 MH084894, R01 MH090264]; Dainippon Sumitomo PharmaDainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and DepressionNARSAD; Mortimer D.

GPCRs are capable of forming heteromeric complexes that differentially alter cell signaling, but the role of this structural arrangement in modulating behavior remains unknown. Here, we identified three residues located at the intracellular end of transmembrane domain four that are necessary for the metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptor to be assembled as a GPCR heteromer with the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor in the mouse frontal cortex. Substitution of these residues (Ala-677(4.40), Ala-681(4.44), and Ala-685(4.48)) leads to absence of 5-HT2A.mGlu2 receptor complex formation, an effect that is associated with a decrease in their heteromeric ligand binding interaction. Disruption of heteromeric expression with mGlu2 attenuates the psychosis-like effects induced in mice by hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists. Furthermore, the ligand binding interaction between the components of the 5-HT2A.mGlu2 receptor heterocomplex is up-regulated in the frontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects as compared with controls. Together, these findings provide structural evidence for the unique behavioral function of a GPCR heteromer.","[Moreno, Jose L.; Umali, Adrienne; Holloway, Terrell; Pilar-Cuellar, Fuencisla; Mocci, Giuseppe; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Seto, Jeremy; Sealfon, Stuart C.; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Mortillo, Steven; Sealfon, Stuart C.; Benson, Deanna L.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Sealfon, Stuart C.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Ctr Translat Syst Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Sealfon, Stuart C.; Benson, Deanna L.; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Muguruza, Carolina; Callado, Luis F.; Javier Meana, J.] Univ Pais Vasco Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Univ Basque Country, Dept Pharmacol, E-48490 Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain; [Umali, Adrienne; Callado, Luis F.; Javier Meana, J.] Univ Pais Vasco Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Univ Basque Country, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, E-48490 Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain; [Lopez-Gimenez, Juan F.] Fac Med, Inst Biomed Biotecnol Cantabria, E-39011 Santander, Spain; [Milligan, Graeme; Lopez-Gimenez, Juan F.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Mol Cell & Syst Biol, Mol Pharmacol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Neve, Rachael L.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Gonzalez-Maeso, J (corresponding author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 1425 Madison Ave,Box 1229, New York, NY 10029 USA.",Javier.Maeso@mssm.edu,"Lopez-Gimenez, Juan/K-5823-2014; Callado, Luis F/A-7024-2008; Muguruza, Carolina/AAR-4531-2021; Muguruza, Carolina/B-8986-2013; Pilar-Cuellar, Fuencisla/L-2983-2014; Moreno, Jose L/L-8981-2017; Milligan, Graeme/F-9426-2011","Lopez-Gimenez, Juan/0000-0003-3021-6200; Callado, Luis F/0000-0001-9941-012X; Muguruza, Carolina/0000-0002-0477-5757; Muguruza, Carolina/0000-0002-0477-5757; Pilar-Cuellar, Fuencisla/0000-0003-1229-001X; Milligan, Graeme/0000-0002-6946-3519; MEANA, JOSE JAVIER/0000-0002-7913-6714; Benson, Deanna/0000-0001-7037-1147; CALLADO HERNANDO, LUIS FELIPE/0000-0002-5564-3447; SEALFON, Stuart/0000-0001-5791-1217","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 MH084894, R01 NS37731, P01 DA12923]; Dainippon Sumi-tomo PharmaDainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and DepressionNARSAD; Mortimer D.

The serotonin and glutamate systems are suspected in the etiology of schizophrenia, as well as in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. The effects of hallucinogens, such as psilocybin and mescaline, require the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and induce schizophrenia-like psychosis in humans. In addition, metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu(2/3) agonists show promise as a new treatment for schizophrenia. Here, we investigated the level of expression and behavioral function of 5-HT2A and mGlu(2) receptors in a mouse model of maternal influenza viral infection. We show that spontaneous locomotor activity is diminished by maternal infection with the mouse-adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. The behavioral responses to hallucinogens and glutamate antipsychotics are both affected by maternal exposure to influenza virus, with increased head-twitch response to hallucinogens and diminished antipsychotic-like effect of the glutamate agonist. In frontal cortex of mice born to influenza virus-infected mothers, the 5-HT2A receptor is upregulated and the mGlu(2) receptor is downregulated, an alteration that may be involved in the behavioral changes observed. Additionally, we find that the cortical 5-HT2A receptor-dependent signaling pathways are significantly altered in the offspring of infected mothers, showing higher c-fos, egr-1, and egr-2 expression in response to the hallucinogenic drug DOI. Identifying a biochemical alteration that parallels the behavioral changes observed in a mouse model of prenatal viral infection may facilitate targeting therapies for treatment and prevention of schizophrenia.","[Moreno, Jose L.; Kurita, Mitsumasa; Holloway, Terrell; Lopez, Javier; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Lopez, Javier; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Cadagan, Richard; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Global Hlth & Emerging Pathogens Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA","Gonzalez-Maeso, J (corresponding author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 1425 Madison Ave,Box 1229, New York, NY 10029 USA.",Javier.Maeso@mssm.edu,,"Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo/0000-0002-6551-1827; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis/0000-0001-7084-0804","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [5R01MH084894]; Dainippon Sumitomo PharmaDainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression Young Investigator AwardNARSAD; Maltz Family Foundation; Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis through National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [HHSN266200700010C]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, SpainSpanish Government; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH084894] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant 5R01MH084894 and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, as well as a National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression Young Investigator Award and Maltz Family Foundation Award to J.G.-M.

Its primary active ingredient, Salvinorin A (SA)-a highly selective agonist at the kappa opiate receptor-is believed to be one of the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogens. However, there is little experimental data on the effects of SA in humans. Methods: In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, psychophysiological, and endocrine effects of 0 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg of inhaled SA were characterized in 10 healthy individuals who had previously used Salvia. Results: SA produced psychotomimetic effects and perceptual alterations, including dissociative and somaesthetic effects, increased plasma cortisol and prolactin, and reduced resting electroencephalogram spectral power. The SA administration was associated with a rapid increase of its levels in the blood. SA did not produce euphoria, cognitive deficits, or changes in vital signs. The effects were transient and not dose-related. SA administration was very well-tolerated without acute or delayed adverse effects. Conclusions: SA produced a wide range of transient effects in healthy subjects. The perceptual altering effects and lack of euphoric effects would explain its intermittent use pattern. Such a profile would also suggest a low addictive potential similar to other hallucinogens and consistent with kappa opiate receptor agonism. Further work is warranted to carefully characterize a full spectrum of its effects in humans, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved, and to explore the basis for individual variability in its effects.","[Ranganathan, Mohini; Schnakenberg, Ashley; Skosnik, Patrick D.; Sewell, R.

While the hypo-activity of serotonin signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder; LSD, an agonist of serotonin type 2 receptor (5-HTR2A) induces psychosis. Therefore, anxiety and depressive disorders are treated by SSRIs which inhibit serotonin transporter (5-HTT) while psychotic disorders are controlled by drugs that block serotonin and/or dopamine receptors. Since genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic dysregulation of 5-HTT are involved in the pathogenesis of mental diseases, we analyzed DNA methylation of 5-HTT promoter in post-mortem brains and saliva samples of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to evaluate its potential application as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic biomarker in SCZ and BD. Methods: Whole genome DNA methylation profiling was performed for a total of 24 samples (including two saliva samples) using the Illumina 27 K (for 12 samples) and 450 K DNA methylation array platform(for another 12 samples), followed by bisulfite sequencing to identify candidate CpGs for further analysis. Quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) was used to assess the degree of CpG methylation of 5-HTT promoter in 105 post-mortem brains (35 controls, 35 SCZ and 35 BD) and 100 saliva samples (30 controls, 30 SCZ, 20 BD and 20 first degree relatives of SCZ or BD). The U133 2.0 Plus Human Transcriptome array for a total of 30 post-mortem brain samples (each group 10) followed by quantitative real-time PCR was used to study 5-HTT expression in 105 post-mortem brain samples. Results: The qMSP analysis for 5-HTT promoter region showed DNA hypermethylation in post-mortem brain samples of SCZ patients (similar to 30%), particularly in drug free patients (similar to 60%, p = 0.04). Similarly, there was a trend for DNA hypermethylation in antipsychotic free BD patients (similar to 50%, p = 0.066). qMSP analysis of DNA extracted from the saliva samples also exhibited hypermethylation of 5-HTT promoter in patients with SCZ (similar to 30%, p = 0.039), which was more significant in drug naive SCZ patients (>50%, p = 0.0025). However, the difference was not significant between the controls and unaffected first degree relatives of patients with SCZ (p = 0.37) and versus patients using antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.2). The whole genome transcriptome analysis of post-mortem brain samples showed reduced expression of 5-HTT in SCZ compared to the control subjects (similar to 50%, p = 0.008), confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (similar to 40%, p = 0.035) which was more significant in drug free SCZ patients (similar to 70%, p = 0.022). Conclusion: A correlation between reduction in 5-HTT expression and DNA hypermethylation of the 5-HTT promoter in drug naive SCZ patients suggests that an epigenetically defined hypo-activity of 5-HTT may be linked to SCZ pathogenesis. Furthermore, this epigenetic mark in DNA extracted from saliva can be considered as one of the key determinants in a panel of diagnostic and/or therapeutic biomarkers for SCZ. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

All studies to date assume that the supersaturation profile generated in its growth chamber is not influenced by the condensation of water vapor upon the growing CCN. The validity of this assumption, however, has never been systematically explored. This work examines when water vapor depletion from CCN can have an important impact on supersaturation, measured CCN concentration, and droplet growth. A fully coupled numerical flow model of the instrument is used to simulate the water vapor supersaturation, temperature, velocity profiles, and CCN growth in the CFSTGC for a wide range of operation and CCN concentrations. Laboratory CCN activation experiments of polydisperse calibration aerosol (with a DMT CFSTGC operated in constant flow mode) are used to evaluate the simulations. The simulations and laboratory experiments are then generalized using a scaling analysis of the conditions that lead to supersaturation depletion. We find that CCN concentrations below 5000 cm(-3) (regardless of their activation kinetics or instrument operating conditions) do not decrease supersaturation and outlet droplet diameter by more than 10%. For larger CCN concentrations, a simple correction can be applied that addresses both the depression in supersaturation and droplet size.","[Lathem, Terry L.; Nenes, Athanasios] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nenes, Athanasios] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Nenes, A (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",athanasios.nenes@gatech.edu,,,NSF CAREERNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Georgia Institute of Technology,"We would like to thank R.

Major depression and anxiety disorders are treated using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-small molecules that competitively block substrate binding and thereby prolong neurotransmitter action(2,4). The dopamine and noradrenaline transporters, together with SERT, are members of the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family. The transport activities of NSSs can be inhibited or modulated by cocaine and amphetamines(2,3), and genetic variants of NSSs are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and bipolar disorder(2,5). Studies of bacterial NSS homologues-including LeuT-have shown how their transmembrane helices (TMs) undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle, exposing a central binding site to either side of the membrane(1,6-12). However, the conformational changes associated with transport in NSSs remain unknown. To elucidate structure-based mechanisms for transport in SERT we investigated its complexes with ibogaine, a hallucinogenic natural product with psychoactive and anti-addictive properties(13,14.) Notably, ibogaine is a non-competitive inhibitor of transport but displays competitive binding towards selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(15,16). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of SERT-ibogaine complexes captured in outward-open, occluded and inward-open conformations. Ibogaine binds to the central binding site, and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMs 1b and 6a. Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hinge-like movement of TM1a and the partial unwinding of TM5, which together create a permeation pathway that enables substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm. These structures define the structural rearrangements that occur from the outward-open to inward-open conformations, and provide insight into the mechanism of neurotransmitter transport and ibogaine inhibition.","[Coleman, Jonathan A.; Yang, Dongxue; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, L474, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Zhao, Zhiyu; Wen, Po-Chao; Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL USA; [Zhao, Zhiyu; Wen, Po-Chao; Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL USA; [Yoshioka, Craig] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Gouaux, E (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, L474, Portland, OR 97201 USA.; Gouaux, E (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,"Gouaux, Eric/Y-4370-2019; Wen, Po-Chao/Q-5293-2019; Yoshioka, Craig/ABH-3720-2020; Tajkhorshid, Emad/AAN-8323-2021","Gouaux, Eric/0000-0002-8549-2360; Wen, Po-Chao/0000-0002-6049-6904; Coleman, Jonathan/0000-0003-0001-6195; Zhao, Zhiyu/0000-0001-9758-5073","XSEDE grant [TGMCA06N060]; Blue Waters of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois [ACI1713784]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5R37MH070039, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, R01GM123455]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM123455, P41GM104601, U54GM087519] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH070039, R01MH070039] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the National Institute for Drug Abuse, Drug Supply Program for providing ibogaine and [3H] ibogaine, L.

The dorsal part of the midline thalamus (dMT) contains structures such as the mediodorsal nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, and paratenial nucleus that project prominently to mPFC, as well as to basal (BA) and central (Ce) nuclei of the amygdala. Using temporary inactivation with GABA agonist muscimol, we found that dMT was necessary for retrieving auditory fear memory that was 24 h old, but not 2-8 h old. However, pre-training infusions did not impair fear acquisition or extinction. To determine the possible targets of dMT that might modulate fear retrieval, we combined dMT inactivation with Fos immunohistochemistry. Rats with inactivation-induced impairment in fear retrieval showed increased Fos in the lateral division of Ce (CeL), and decreased Fos in the medial division of Ce. No differences in Fos expression were observed in the mPFC or BA. We suggest that the projections from the paraventricular nucleus to CeL are involved in retrieval of well consolidated fear memories.

The aim of this qualitative study was to provide an initial understanding of what characterizes the experiences induced by MXE. Anonymously written reports (33 persons) on the effects of MXE were collected from public Internet forums and analyzed using the Empirical Phenomenological Psychological Method. The analysis generated 10 themes: (1) preparation, motivation and anticipation; (2) initial effects; (3) malfunction of cognitive processes stabilizing normal state; (4) inner personal processes and learning; (5) emotional processes; (6) altered sensory perception; (7) dissolution and transition; (8) spiritual and transcendental experiences; (9) effects and processes after the experience; (10) re-dosing and addiction. MXE induced a heavily altered state of consciousness. The effects were similar to those induced by classic hallucinogens (such as LSD, psilocybin) and the dissociative ketamine. MXE seemed to have quite a high abuse potential. Beside the positive effects described, negative effects like fear and anxiety were also reported. Acceptance was considered the best coping strategy. Dissolution of identity and body often culminated in spiritual and transcendental experiences. More research is needed on safety issues, how to minimize harm, and the motivation for using legal highs.","[Kjellgren, Anette; Jonsson, Kristoffer] Karlstad Univ, Dept Psychol, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden","Kjellgren, A (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Psychol, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",Anette.Kjellgren@kau.se,,,,,,46,50,50,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0279-1072,2159-9777,,J PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS,J.

If youth at risk for attrition can be identified at treatment entry or early in treatment, they can be targeted for interventions to help retain them in treatment. Methods: Opioid dependent adolescents and young adults (n = 152), aged 15-21, were randomized to 12 weeks (BUP, n = 74) or 2 weeks of detoxification (DETOX, n = 78) with buprenorphine/naloxone (Bup/Nal), both in combination with 12 weeks of psychosocial treatment Baseline and early treatment related predictors of treatment attrition were identified in each group using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: In the DETOX group 36% left between weeks 2 and 4, at the end of the dose taper, while in the BUP group only 8% left by week 4. In the BUP group, early adherence to Bup/Nal, early opioid negative urines, use of any medications in the month prior to treatment entry, and lifetime non-heroin opioid use were associated with retention while prior 30-day hallucinogen use was associated with attrition. In the DETOX group, only use of sleep medications was associated with retention although not an independent predictor. A broad range of other pre-treatment characteristics was unrelated to attrition. Conclusions: Prompt attention to those with early non-adherence to medication or an early opioid positive urine, markers available in the first 2 weeks of treatment, may improve treatment retention. Extended Bup/Nal treatment appeared effective in improving treatment retention for youth with opioid dependence across a wide range of demographics, and pre-treatment clinical characteristics.

Salvinorin A is a selective high efficacy kappa-opioid receptor (KOPr) agonist, and thus implicates the KOPr system and its endogenous agonist ligands (the dynorphins) in higher functions, including cognition and perceptual effects. Salvinorin A is the only selective KOPr ligand to be widely available outside research or medical settings, and salvinorin A-containing products have undergone frequent nonmedical use. KOPr/dynorphin systems in the brain are known to be powerful countermodulatory mechanisms to dopaminergic function, which is important in mood and reward engendered by natural and chemical reinforcers (including drugs of abuse). KOPr activation (including by salvinorin A) can thus cause aversion and anhedonia in preclinical models. Salvinorin A is also a completely new scaffold for medicinal chemistry approaches, since it is a non-nitrogenous neoclerodane, unlike other known opioid ligands. Ongoing efforts have the goal of discovering novel semi-synthetic salvinorin analogs with potential KOPr-mediated pharmacotherapeutic effects (including partial agonist or biased agonist effects), with a reduced burden of undesirable effects associated with salvinorin A.","[Butelman, Eduardo R.; Kreek, Mary Jeanne] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Biol Addict Dis, New York, NY 10065 USA","Butelman, ER (corresponding author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Biol Addict Dis, 1230 York Ave,Box 171, New York, NY 10065 USA.",butelme@rockefeller.edu,,,"NIH-NIDA grants [DA018151, DA05130, DA017369]; Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

This open-label study of the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin was performed to describe the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of psilocybin in sequential, escalating oral doses of 0.3, 0.45, and 0.6 mg/kg in 12 healthy adults. Eligible healthy adults received 6-8 h of preparatory counseling in anticipation of the first dose of psilocybin. The escalating oral psilocybin doses were administered at approximately monthly intervals in a controlled setting and subjects were monitored for 24 h. Blood and urine samples were collected over 24 h and assayed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for psilocybin and psilocin, the active metabolite. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were determined using both compartmental (NONMEM) and noncompartmental (WinNonlin) methods. No psilocybin was found in plasma or urine, and renal clearance of intact psilocin accounted for less than 2% of the total clearance. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were linear within the twofold range of doses, and the elimination half-life of psilocin was 3 h (standard deviation 1.1). An extended elimination phase in some subjects suggests hydrolysis of the psilocin glucuronide metabolite. Variation in psilocin clearance was not predicted by body weight, and no serious adverse events occurred in the subjects studied. The small amount of psilocin renally excreted suggests that no dose reduction is needed for subjects with mild-moderate renal impairment. Simulation of fixed doses using the pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that an oral dose of 25 mg should approximate the drug exposure of a 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of psilocybin. Although doses of 0.6 mg/kg are in excess of likely therapeutic doses, no serious physical or psychological events occurred during or within 30 days of any dose.","[Brown, Randall T.; Nicholas, Christopher R.; Thomas, Chantelle D.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Family Med, Madison, WI USA; [Cozzi, Nicholas V.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Cell & Regenerat Biol, Madison, WI USA; [Gassman, Michele C.; Cooper, Karen M.; Henriquez, Kelsey M.; Ribaudo, Alexandra S.; Hutson, Paul R.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Pharm, 777 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Muller, Daniel] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Med, Madison, WI USA; [Hetzel, Scott J.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Biostatist & Med Informat, Madison, WI USA","Hutson, PR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Pharm, 777 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",paul.hutson@wisc.edu,"Cozzi, Nicholas/AAT-1633-2020",,Psilocybin Research Fund at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Foundation; Usona Research Institute,"This study was funded by gifts from the Psilocybin Research Fund at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Foundation, and by the Usona Research Institute.",,37,38,39,1,44,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",0312-5963,1179-1926,,CLIN PHARMACOKINET,Clin.

To better evaluate this topic, we performed a systematic literature review using the PubMed database to find quantitative studies (using statistical analysis) that assessed the effects of ayahuasca or its components in drug-related symptoms or disorders. We found five animal studies (using harmaline, harmine, or ayahuasca) and five observational studies of regular ayahuasca consumers. All animal studies showed improvement of biochemical or behavioral parameters related to drug-induced disorders. Of the five human studies, four reported significant reductions of dependence symptoms or substance use, while one did not report significant results. The mechanisms responsible for the anti-addictive properties of ayahuasca and its alkaloids are not clarified, apparently involving both peripheral MAO-A inhibition by the -carbolines and central agonism of DMT at 5-HT2A receptors expressed in brain regions related to the regulation of mood and emotions. Although results are promising, controlled studies are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.","[Nunes, Amanda A.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biosci, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [dos Santos, Rafael G.; Osorio, Flavia L.; Sanches, Rafael F.; Crippa, Jose Alexandre S.; Hallak, Jaime E.

Salvinorin A, isolated from the plant Salvia divinorum, and its semi-synthetic analogues have been shown to have potent KOP receptor agonist activity and may induce a unique response with similar anticocaine addiction effects as the classic KOP receptor agonists, but with a different side effect profile. Experimental ApproachWe evaluated the duration of effects of Mesyl Sal Bin vivo utilizing antinociception assays and screened for cocaine-prime induced cocaine-seeking behaviour in self-administering rats to predict anti-addiction effects. Cellular transporter uptake assays and in vitro voltammetry were used to assess modulation of dopamine transporter (DAT) function and to investigate transporter trafficking and kinase signalling pathways modulated by KOP receptor agonists. Key ResultsMesyl Sal B had a longer duration of action than SalA, had anti-addiction properties and increased DAT function in vitro in a KOP receptor-dependent and Pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. These effects on DAT function required ERK1/2 activation. We identified differences between Mesyl Sal B and SalA, with Mesyl Sal B increasing the V-max of dopamine uptake without altering cell-surface expression of DAT. Conclusions and ImplicationsSalA analogues, such as Mesyl Sal B, have potential for development as anticocaine agents. Further tests are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which the novel salvinorin-based neoclerodane diterpene KOP receptor ligands produce both anti-addiction and adverse side effects.

Aims To characterise the time course of regional brain activity leading to auditory verbal hallucinations. Method During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 11 patients with schizophrenia or schizoa fective disorder signalled auditory verbal hallucination events by pressing a button. To control for effects of motor behaviour, regional activity associated with hall cination events was scaled against corresponding activity arising from random button-presses produced by 10 patients who did not experience hallucinations. Results Immediately prior to the hallucinations, motor-adjusted activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus was significantly greater than corresponding activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, motor-adjusted activity in a right posterior temporal region overshadowed corresponding activity in the left homologous temporal region. Robustly elevated motor-adjusted activity in the left temporal region associated with auditory verbal hallucinations was also detected, but only subsequent to hallucination events. At the earliest time shift studied, the correlation between left inferior frontal gyrus and right temporal activity was significantly higher for the hallucination group compared with non-hallucinating patients. Conclusions Findings suggest that heightened functional coupling between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right temporal regions leads to coactivation in these speech processing regions that is hallucinogenic. Delayed left temporal activation may reflect impaired corollary discharge contributing to source misattribution of resulting verbal images.","[Hoffman, Ralph E.; Pittman, Brian; Bhagwagar, Zubin] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Constable, R.

Major depression and anxiety disorders are treated using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-small molecules that competitively block substrate binding and thereby prolong neurotransmitter action(2,4). The dopamine and noradrenaline transporters, together with SERT, are members of the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family. The transport activities of NSSs can be inhibited or modulated by cocaine and amphetamines(2,3), and genetic variants of NSSs are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and bipolar disorder(2,5). Studies of bacterial NSS homologues-including LeuT-have shown how their transmembrane helices (TMs) undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle, exposing a central binding site to either side of the membrane(1,6-12). However, the conformational changes associated with transport in NSSs remain unknown. To elucidate structure-based mechanisms for transport in SERT we investigated its complexes with ibogaine, a hallucinogenic natural product with psychoactive and anti-addictive properties(13,14.) Notably, ibogaine is a non-competitive inhibitor of transport but displays competitive binding towards selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(15,16). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of SERT-ibogaine complexes captured in outward-open, occluded and inward-open conformations. Ibogaine binds to the central binding site, and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMs 1b and 6a. Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hinge-like movement of TM1a and the partial unwinding of TM5, which together create a permeation pathway that enables substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm. These structures define the structural rearrangements that occur from the outward-open to inward-open conformations, and provide insight into the mechanism of neurotransmitter transport and ibogaine inhibition.","[Coleman, Jonathan A.; Yang, Dongxue; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, L474, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Zhao, Zhiyu; Wen, Po-Chao; Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL USA; [Zhao, Zhiyu; Wen, Po-Chao; Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL USA; [Yoshioka, Craig] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Gouaux, E (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, L474, Portland, OR 97201 USA.; Gouaux, E (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,"Gouaux, Eric/Y-4370-2019; Wen, Po-Chao/Q-5293-2019; Yoshioka, Craig/ABH-3720-2020; Tajkhorshid, Emad/AAN-8323-2021","Gouaux, Eric/0000-0002-8549-2360; Wen, Po-Chao/0000-0002-6049-6904; Coleman, Jonathan/0000-0003-0001-6195; Zhao, Zhiyu/0000-0001-9758-5073","XSEDE grant [TGMCA06N060]; Blue Waters of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois [ACI1713784]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5R37MH070039, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, R01GM123455]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM123455, P41GM104601, U54GM087519] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH070039, R01MH070039] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the National Institute for Drug Abuse, Drug Supply Program for providing ibogaine and [3H] ibogaine, L.

In addition to endogenous 5-HT, several hallucinogens, antipsychotics, and antidepressants function by targeting 5-HT(2A)R5. Preclinical studies show that 5-HT2AR antagonists have antipsychotic and antidepressant properties, whereas agonist ligands possess cognition-enhancing and hallucinogenic properties. Abnormal 5-HT2AR activity is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders and conditions, including depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. In addition to its traditional activity as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), recent studies have defined novel operations of 5-HT(2A)R5. Here we review progress in the (1) receptor anatomy and biology: distribution, signaling, polymerization and allosteric modulation; and (2) receptor functions: learning and memory, hallucination and spatial cognition, and mental disorders. Based on the recent progress in basic research on the 5-HT2AR, it appears that post-training 5-HT2AR activation enhances non-spatial memory consolidation, while pre-training 5-HT2AR activation facilitates fear extinction. Further, the potential influence that 5-HT2AR-elicited visual hallucinations may have on visual cue (i.e., landmark) guided spatial cognition is discussed. We conclude that the development of selective 5-HT2AR modulators to target distinct signaling pathways and neural circuits represents a new possibility for treating emotional, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders.","[Zhang, Gongliang] Anhui Med Univ, Coll Basic Med, Hefei 230032, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gongliang] Florida Atlantic Univ, Charles E Schmidt Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Zhang, Gongliang; Stackman, Robert W., Jr.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Jupiter Life Sci Initiat, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Stackman, Robert W., Jr.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Charles E Schmidt Coll Sci, Dept Psychol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA","Zhang, GL (corresponding author), Anhui Med Univ, Coll Basic Med, 81 Meishan Rd, Hefei 230032, Anhui, Peoples R China.",gzhang@fau.edu; rstackma@fau.edu,"Stackman, Robert W./E-8685-2019","Stackman Jr, Robert/0000-0002-5950-046X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN 0630522]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH 086591]; Researcher of the Year award from the Division of Research at Florida Atlantic University; National Natural Science Foundation general projects from China [81271217, 81471161]; Ph.D. Start Fund from Anhui Medical University [XJ201405]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH086591] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This project was supported by the NSF (IBN 0630522) and NIH (MH 086591) and a Researcher of the Year award from the Division of Research at Florida Atlantic University to RS and National Natural Science Foundation general projects from China (81271217, 81471161), Ph.D. Start Fund from Anhui Medical University (XJ201405) to GZ.",,186,118,123,3,36,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-9812,,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

Stress-induced activation of dynorphin-KOR is well known to produce analgesia, and more recently, it has been implicated as a mediator of stress-induced responses including anxiety, depression, and reinstatement of drug seeking. Drugs selectively targeting specific KOR signaling pathways may prove potentially useful as therapeutic treatments for mood and addiction disorders. KOR is a member of the seven transmembrane spanning (7TM) G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. KOR activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins leads to G alpha i/o inhibition of adenylyl cyclase production of cAMP and releases G beta gamma, which modulates the conductances of Ca+2 and K+ channels. In addition, KOR agonists activate kinase cascades including G-protein coupled Receptor Kinases (GRK) and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family: ERK1/2, p38 and JNK. Recent pharmacological data suggests that GPCRs exist as dynamic, multi-conformational protein complexes that can be directed by specific ligands towards distinct signaling pathways. Ligand-induced conformations of KOR that evoke beta-arrestin-dependent p38 MAPK activation result in aversion; whereas ligand-induced conformations that activate JNK without activating arrestin produce long-lasting inactivation of KOR signaling. In this review, we discuss the current status of KOR signal transduction research and the data that support two novel hypotheses: (1) KOR selective partial agonists that do not efficiently activate p38 MAPK may be useful analgesics without producing the dysphoric or hallucinogenic effects of selective, highly efficacious KOR agonists and (2) KOR antagonists that do not activate JNK may be effective short-acting drugs that may promote stress-resilience.","[Bruchas, Michael R.; Chavkin, Charles] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Chavkin, C (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cchavkin@u.washington.edu,"Chavkin, Charles/G-2797-2010; Bruchas, Michael/G-7616-2012",,"National Institute on Drug Abuse U.S. Public Health ServiceUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)United States Public Health Service [DA25970, DA20570, DA25182]; Hope for Depression Research Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R21DA025970, K99DA025182, K05DA020570] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse U.S. Public Health Service Grants DA25970, DA20570, and DA25182 and the Hope for Depression Research Foundation.",,109,180,189,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JUN,2010,210,2,10.1007/s00213-010-1806-y,,,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,592XW,WOS:000277416300004,20401607,Green Accepted,,,21/12/21,Not classic psychedelic ,ACN,
