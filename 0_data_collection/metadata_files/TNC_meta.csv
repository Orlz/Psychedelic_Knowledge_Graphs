Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

By the early 1970s, however, political and cultural pressures forced the cessation of all projects. This investigation reexamines a potentially promising clinical application of hallucinogens in the treatment of anxiety reactive to advanced-stage cancer. Objective: To explore the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with advanced-stage cancer and reactive anxiety. Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety, with subjects acting as their own control, using a moderate dose (0.2 mg/kg) of psilocybin. Setting: A clinical research unit within a large public sector academic medical center. Participants: Twelve adults with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Main Outcome Measures: In addition to monitoring safety and subjective experience before and during experimental treatment sessions, follow-up data including results from the Beck Depression Inventory, Profile of Mood States, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were collected unblinded for 6 months after treatment. Results: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: This study established the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long-neglected field.","[Grob, Charles S.; Chopra, Gurpreet S.] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Torrance, CA 90509 USA; [McKay, Charles R.] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Torrance, CA 90509 USA; [Grob, Charles S.; Danforth, Alicia L.; Hagerty, Marycie; McKay, Charles R.] Los Angeles Biomed Res Inst, Torrance, CA USA; [Halberstadt, Adam L.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Greer, George R.] Heffter Res Inst, Santa Fe, NM USA","Grob, CS (corresponding author), Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Box 498,1000 W Carson St, Torrance, CA 90509 USA.",cgrob@labiomed.org,"Halberstadt, Adam L/J-9328-2015",,Heffter Research Institute; Betsy Gordon Foundation; Nathan Cummings Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [M01-RR00425]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [M01RR000425] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Funding/Support: This work was supported by the Heffter Research Institute; the Betsy Gordon Foundation; the Nathan Cummings Foundation, with the support and encouragement of James K.

They are generally considered physiologically safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction. Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in many sociocultural and ritual contexts. After the virtually contemporaneous discovery of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide (LSD)-25 and the identification of serotonin in the brain, early research focused intensively on the possibility that LSD and other psychedelics had a serotonergic basis for their action. Today there is a consensus that psychedelics are agonists or partial agonists at brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors, with particular importance on those expressed on apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in layer V. Several useful rodent models have been developed over the years to help unravel the neurochemical correlates of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor activation in the brain, and a variety of imaging techniques have been employed to identify key brain areas that are directly affected by psychedelics. Recent and exciting developments in the field have occurred in clinical research, where several double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with cancer-related psychosocial distress have demonstrated unprecedented positive relief of anxiety and depression. Two small pilot studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy also have shown positive benefit in treating both alcohol and nicotine addiction. Recently, blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography have been employed for in vivo brain imaging in humans after administration of a psychedelic, and results indicate that intravenously administered psilocybin and LSD produce decreases in oscillatory power in areas of the brain's default mode network.","[Nichols, David E.] Univ N Carolina, Eschelman Sch Pharm, Chapel Hill, NC USA","Nichols, DE (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Eschelman Sch Pharm, Chapel Hill, NC USA.",drdave@purdue.edu,,,National Institutes of Health National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01DA-02189]; Robert C. and Charlotte P.

Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. Methods In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary effi cacy outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797. Findings Psilocybin's acute psychedelic effects typically became detectable 30-60 min after dosing, peaked 2-3 h after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing. Mean self-rated intensity (on a 0-1 scale) was 0.51 (SD 0.36) for the low-dose session and 0.75 (SD 0.27) for the high-dose session. Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients). Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference -11.8, 95% CI-9.15 to -14.35, p= 0.002, Hedges' g=3.1) and 3 months (-9.2, 95% CI -5.69 to -12.71, p= 0.003, Hedges' g= 2) after high-dose treatment. Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted. Interpretation This study provides preliminary support for the safety and effi cacy of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and motivates further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach.

Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition.","[Carhart-Harris, Robin L.; Erritzoe, David; Stone, James M.; Reed, Laurence J.; Colasanti, Alessandro; Tyacke, Robin J.; Nutt, David J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Neuropsychopharmacol Unit, London W12 0NN, England; [Carhart-Harris, Robin L.; Williams, Tim; Malizia, Andrea L.; Nutt, David J.] Univ Bristol, Acad Unit Psychiat, Bristol BS8 2BN, Avon, England; [Murphy, Kevin; Hobden, Peter; Evans, John; Wise, Richard G.] Cardiff Univ, Brain Res Imaging Ctr, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Feilding, Amanda] Beckley Fdn, Oxford OX3 9SY, England; [Erritzoe, David] Univ Copenhagen, Neurobiol Res Unit, Rigshosp, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Erritzoe, David] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Integrated Mol Brain Imaging, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Nutt, DJ (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Neuropsychopharmacol Unit, London W12 0NN, England.",d.nutt@imperial.ac.uk,"Stone, J M/H-9424-2019; Wise, Richard G/A-3869-2010; Murphy, Kevin/A-1581-2010; Leech, Robert/AAE-8254-2019; Evans, C.

Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. Results: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression. Conclusions: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of primary states is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit criticality, i.e., the property of being poised at a critical point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the defaul-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.","[Carhart-Harris, Robin L.; Nutt, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Neuropsychopharmacol, Dept Med, Div Brain Sci, London W12 0NN, England; [Leech, Robert; Hellyer, Peter J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Div Brain Sci, C3NL, London W12 0NN, England; [Shanahan, Murray] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Comp, London W12 0NN, England; [Feilding, Amanda] Beckley Fdn, Oxford, England; [Tagliazucchi, Enzo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Neurol, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Tagliazucchi, Enzo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Brain Imaging Ctr, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Chialvo, Dante R.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Carhart-Harris, RL (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Neuropsychopharmacol, Dept Med, Div Brain Sci, Burlington Danes Bldg,Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",r.carhart-harris@imperial.ac.uk,"Leech, Robert/AAE-8254-2019; Chialvo, Dante R/A-4658-2009; Chialvo, Dante R./P-5279-2019; Hellyer, Peter J/F-7112-2013","Leech, Robert/0000-0002-5801-6318; Chialvo, Dante R/0000-0002-1038-3637; Chialvo, Dante R./0000-0002-1038-3637; Hellyer, Peter J/0000-0002-5139-3401; Feilding, Amanda/0000-0002-1329-1893","Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/J00460X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MR/J00460X/1, 1110783] Funding Source: researchfish",We would like to thank the reviewers for their useful comments on previous versions of this manuscript.

This study sought to evaluate the effects of a single dose of AYA in six volunteers with a current depressive episode. Methods: Open-label trial conducted in an inpatient psychiatric unit. Results: Statistically significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores were observed between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after AYA administration, as measured on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Anxious-Depression subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). AYA administration resulted in nonsignificant changes in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores and in the thinking disorder subscale of the BPRS, suggesting that AYA does not induce episodes of mania and/or hypomania in patients with mood disorders and that modifications in thought content, which could indicate psychedelic effects, are not essential for mood improvement. Conclusions: These results suggest that AYA has fast-acting anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in patients with a depressive disorder.","[Osorio, Flavia de L.; Sanches, Rafael F.; Macedo, Ligia R.; dos Santos, Rafael G.; Wichert-Ana, Lauro; Crippa, Jose A.; Hallak, Jaime E.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Neurosci & Behav, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Sanches, Rafael F.; Riba, Jordi] Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Ctr Invest Medicaments, Serv Farmacol Clin, Barcelona, Spain; [Maia-de-Oliveira, Joao P.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Clin Med, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [de Araujo, Draulio B.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Hosp Univ Onofre Lopes, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [de Araujo, Draulio B.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Inst Brain, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Riba, Jordi] Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Human Expt Neuropsychopharmacol, Inst Recerca, Barcelona, Spain; [Riba, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Pharmacol & Treatment, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Riba, Jordi] CIBERSAM, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Barcelona, Spain","Hallak, JE (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Neurociencias & Ciencias Comportamento, Fac Med Ribeirao Preto, Hosp Clin, 36 Andar,Ave Bandeirantes 3900, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",jhallak@fmrp.usp.br,"dos Santos, Rafael/ABF-1241-2020; Araujo, Draulio/I-6038-2012; Wichert-Ana, Lauro/C-8373-2012; de Souza Crippa, Jose Alexandre/A-1215-2008; Osorio, Flavia L./T-5001-2019; Osorio, Flavia L./H-6079-2012; dos Santos, Rafael Guimaraes/F-7124-2010","dos Santos, Rafael/0000-0003-2388-4745; Araujo, Draulio/0000-0002-6934-2485; Wichert-Ana, Lauro/0000-0003-2059-5120; dos Santos, Rafael Guimaraes/0000-0003-2388-4745; Riba, Jordi/0000-0002-9375-8421; L.

In this present synthesis, we integrate previous perspectives with new and older data to create a novel bipartite model centred on the view that serotonin neurotransmission enhances two distinct adaptive responses to adversity, mediated in large part by its two most prevalent and researched brain receptors: the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. We propose that passive coping (i.e. tolerating a source of stress) is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and characterised by stress moderation. Conversely, we argue that active coping (i.e. actively addressing a source of stress) is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling and characterised by enhanced plasticity (defined as capacity for change). We propose that 5-HT1AR-mediated stress moderation may be the brain's default response to adversity but that an improved ability to change one's situation and/or relationship to it via 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may also be important-and increasingly so as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We propose that the 5-HT1AR pathway is enhanced by conventional 5-HT reuptake blocking antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), whereas the 5-HT2AR pathway is enhanced by 5-HT2AR-agonist psychedelics. This bipartite model purports to explain how different drugs (SSRIs and psychedelics) that modulate the serotonergic system in different ways, can achieve complementary adaptive and potentially therapeutic outcomes.","[Carhart-Harris, R.

The ability to promote both structural and functional plasticity in the PFC has been hypothesized to underlie the fast-acting antidepressant properties of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine. Here, we report that, like ketamine, serotonergic psychedelics are capable of robustly increasing neuritogenesis and/or spinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. These changes in neuronal structure are accompanied by increased synapse number and function, as measured by fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiology. The structural changes induced by psychedelics appear to result from stimulation of the TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A signaling pathways and could possibly explain the clinical effectiveness of these compounds. Our results underscore the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and, importantly, identify several lead scaffolds for medicinal chemistry efforts focused on developing plasticity-promoting compounds as safe, effective, and fast-acting treatments for depression and related disorders.","[Ly, Calvin; Greb, Alexandra C.; Zarandi, Sina Soltanzadeh; Duim, Whitney C.; Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cameron, Lindsay P.; Wong, Jonathan M.; Barragan, Eden, V] Univ Calif Davis, Neurosci Grad Program, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Wilson, Paige C.; Paddy, Michael R.; Ori-McKenney, Kassandra M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Burbach, Kyle F.; Dennis, Megan Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Genome Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sood, Alexander; McAllister, A.

Here, we report on safety and efficacy outcomes for up to 6 months in an open-label trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Twenty patients (six females) with (mostly) severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. Depressive symptoms were assessed from 1 week to 6 months post-treatment, with the self-rated QIDS-SR16 as the primary outcome measure. Treatment was generally well tolerated. Relative to baseline, marked reductions in depressive symptoms were observed for the first 5 weeks post-treatment (Cohen's d = 2.2 at week 1 and 2.3 at week 5, both p < 0.001); nine and four patients met the criteria for response and remission at week 5. Results remained positive at 3 and 6 months (Cohen's d = 1.5 and 1.4, respectively, both p < 0.001). No patients sought conventional antidepressant treatment within 5 weeks of psilocybin. Reductions in depressive symptoms at 5 weeks were predicted by the quality of the acute psychedelic experience. Although limited conclusions can be drawn about treatment efficacy from open-label trials, tolerability was good, effect sizes large and symptom improvements appeared rapidly after just two psilocybin treatment sessions and remained significant 6 months post-treatment in a treatment-resistant cohort. Psilocybin represents a promising paradigm for unresponsive depression that warrants further research in double-blind randomised control trials.","[Carhart-Harris, R. L.; Bolstridge, M.; Day, C. M.

Our group recently reported that ayahuasca administration was associated with fast-acting antidepressive effects in 6 depressive patients. The objective of the present work was to assess the antidepressive potentials of ayahuasca in a bigger sample and to investigate its effects on regional cerebral blood flow. In an open-label trial conducted in an inpatient psychiatric unit, 17 patients with recurrent depression received an oral dose of ayahuasca (2.2 mL/kg) and were evaluated with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale, and the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale during acute ayahuasca effects and 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after drug intake. Blood perfusion was assessed eight hours after drug administration by means of single photon emission tomography. Ayahuasca administration was associated with increased psychoactivity (Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale) and significant score decreases in depression-related scales (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) from 80 minutes to day 21. Increased blood perfusion in the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area, brain regions implicated in the regulation of mood and emotions, were observed after ayahuasca intake. Ayahuasca was well tolerated. Vomiting was the only adverse effect recorded, being reported by 47% of the volunteers. Our results suggest that ayahuasca may have fast-acting and sustained antidepressive properties.

Recent evidence from clinical trials shows that the NMDA antagonist ketamine is a revolutionary novel antidepressant because it acts rapidly and is effective for treatment-resistant patients. A single infusion of ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depressed patients within hours and these effects may be sustained for up to 2 weeks. Although the discovery of ketamine's effects has reshaped drug discovery for antidepressants, the psychotomimetic properties of this compound limit the use of this therapy to the most severely ill patients. In order to develop additional antidepressants like ketamine, adequate preclinical behavioral screening paradigms for fast-acting antidepressants need to be established and used to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. This review examines the preclinical literature attempting to model the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. Acute administration of ketamine has produced effects in behavioral screens for antidepressants like the forced swim test, novelty suppression of feeding and in rodent models for depression. Protracted behavioral effects of ketamine have been reported to appear after a single treatment that last for days. This temporal pattern is similar to its clinical effects and may serve as a new animal paradigm for rapid antidepressant effects in humans. In addition, protracted changes in molecules mediating synaptic plasticity have been implicated in mediating the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of ketamine. Current preclinical studies are examining compounds with more specific pharmacological effects at glutamate receptors and synapses in order to develop additional rapidly acting antidepressants without the hallucinogenic side effects or abuse potential of ketamine.","[Browne, Caroline A.; Lucki, Irwin] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lucki, Irwin] Univ Penn, Dept Pharmacol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Lucki, I (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, 125 South 31st St,Room 2204, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",lucki@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Lucki, Irwin/AAX-6061-2021","Browne, Caroline/0000-0001-7463-7870","USPHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service [R01 MH092412, R01 MH086599]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH092412, R01MH086599] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This research was supported by USPHS grants R01 MH092412 and R01 MH086599.,,131,176,181,8,49,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-9812,,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

In the present paper we sought to test this using data from a clinical trial assessing psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In line with previous reports, we hypothesized that the occurrence and magnitude of Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN) (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) (similar to anxiety) would predict long-term positive outcomes, whereas sensory perceptual effects would have negligible predictive value. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with treatment resistant depression underwent treatment with psilocybin (two separate sessions: 10 and 25 mg psilocybin). The Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire was used to assess the quality of experiences in the 25 mg psilocybin session. From the ASC, the dimensions OBN and DED were used to measure the mystical-type and challenging experiences, respectively. The Self-Reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR) at 5 weeks served as the endpoint clinical outcome measure, as in later time points some of the subjects had gone on to receive new treatments, thus confounding inferences. In a repeated measure ANOVA, Time was the within-subject factor (independent variable), with QIDS-SR as the within-subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks. OBN and DED were independent variables. OBN-by-Time and DED-by-Time interactions were the primary outcomes of interest. Results: For the interaction of OBN and DED with Time (QIDS-SR as dependent variable), the main effect and the effects at each time point compared to baseline were all significant (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, respectively, for main effects), confirming our main hypothesis. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation of OBN with QIDS-SR (5 weeks) was specific compared to perceptual dimensions of the ASC (p < 0.05). Discussion: This report further bolsters the view that the quality of the acute psychedelic experience is a key mediator of long-term changes in mental health. Future therapeutic work with psychedelics should recognize the essential importance of quality of experience in determining treatment efficacy and consider ways of enhancing mystical-type experiences and reducing anxiety.","[Roseman, Leor; Nutt, David J.; Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, Psychedel Res Grp, London, England","Roseman, L (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, Psychedel Res Grp, London, England.",leor.roseman13@imperial.ac.uk,,,Imperial College Scholarship Scheme; Edmund J.

Here, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment with psilocybin (serotonin agonist) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Quality pre and post treatment fMRI data were collected from 16 of 19 patients. Decreased depressive symptoms were observed in all 19 patients at 1-week post-treatment and 47% met criteria for response at 5 weeks. Whole-brain analyses revealed post-treatment decreases in CBF in the temporal cortex, including the amygdala. Decreased amygdala CBF correlated with reduced depressive symptoms. Focusing on a priori selected circuitry for RSFC analyses, increased RSFC was observed within the default-mode network (DMN) post-treatment. Increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-bilateral inferior lateral parietal cortex RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5-weeks, as was decreased parahippocampal-prefrontal cortex RSFC. These data fill an important knowledge gap regarding the post-treatment brain effects of psilocybin, and are the first in depressed patients. The post-treatment brain changes are different to previously observed acute effects of psilocybin and other 'psychedelics' yet were related to clinical outcomes. A 'reset' therapeutic mechanism is proposed.","[Carhart-Harris, Robin L.; Roseman, Leor; Bolstridge, Mark; Pannekoek, J.

After the first English language report on LSD in 1950, psychedelics enjoyed a short-lived relationship with psychology and psychiatry. Used most notably as aids to psychotherapy for the treatment of mood disorders and alcohol dependence, drugs such as LSD showed initial therapeutic promise before prohibitive legislature in the mid-1960s effectively ended all major psychedelic research programs. Since the early 1990s, there has been a steady revival of human psychedelic research: last year saw reports on the first modern brain imaging study with LSD and three separate clinical trials of psilocybin for depressive symptoms.

These receptors further predominantly mediate the subjective and behavioral effects of psilocybin and might be important for its recently suggested antidepressive effects. However, the effect of psilocybin on emotional processing biases and the specific contribution of 5-HT2A receptors across different emotional domains is unknown. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind study, 17 healthyhumansubjects received on 4 separate days placebo, psilocybin (215 mu g/kg), the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg), or psilocybin plus ketanserin. Mood states were assessed by self-report ratings, and behavioral and event-related potential measurements were used to quantify facial emotional recognition and goal-directed behavior toward emotional cues. Results: Psilocybin enhanced positive mood and attenuated recognition of negative facial expression. Furthermore, psilocybin increased goal-directed behavior toward positive compared with negative cues, facilitated positive but inhibited negative sequential emotional effects, and valence-dependently attenuated the P300 component. Ketanserin alone had no effects but blocked the psilocybin-induced mood enhancement and decreased recognition of negative facial expression. Conclusions: This study shows that psilocybin shifts the emotional bias across various psychological domains and that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is central in mood regulation and emotional face recognition in healthy subjects. These findings may not only have implications for the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases but may also provide a framework to delineate the mechanisms underlying psylocybin's putative antidepressant effects.","[Kometer, Michael] Univ Hosp Psychiat, Clin Affect Disorders & Gen Psychiat, Heffter Res Ctr, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland","Kometer, M (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Psychiat, Clin Affect Disorders & Gen Psychiat, Heffter Res Ctr, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.kometer@bli.uzh.ch,"Studerus, Erich/AAB-1632-2020; Schmidt, Andre/C-2948-2014","Studerus, Erich/0000-0003-4233-0182; Schmidt, Andre/0000-0001-6055-8397",,,,74,120,122,1,88,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Methods To test the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, we conducted a parallel-arm, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression. Patients received a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo. We assessed changes in depression severity with the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at baseline, and at 1 (D1), 2 (D2), and 7 (D7) days after dosing. Results We observed significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca when compared with placebo at all-time points. MADRS scores were significantly lower in the ayahuasca group compared with placebo at D1 and D2 (p = 0.04), and at D7 (p < 0.0001). Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 (D1: Cohen's d = 0.84; D2: Cohen's d = 0.84; D7: Cohen's d = 1.49). Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2, and significantly higher in the ayahuasca group at D7 (64% v. 27%; p = 0.04). Remission rate showed a trend toward significance at D7 (36% v. 7%, p = 0.054). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test a psychedelic substance in treatment-resistant depression. Overall, this study brings new evidence supporting the safety and therapeutic value of ayahuasca, dosed within an appropriate setting, to help treat depression.

Preliminary studies in animals and humans suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials published from 1990 until 2015, assessing these therapeutic properties. Electronic searches were performed using the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Only clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Of these, 151 studies were identified, of which six met the established criteria. Reviewed studies suggest beneficial effects for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases, and tobacco and alcohol dependence. All drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD may be useful pharmacological tools for the treatment of drug dependence, and anxiety and mood disorders, especially in treatment-resistant patients. These drugs may also be useful pharmacological tools to understand psychiatric disorders and to develop new therapeutic agents. However, all studies reviewed had small sample sizes, and half of them were open-label, proof-of-concept studies. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with more patients are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.","[dos Santos, Rafael G.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med Ribeirao Preto, Dept Neurociencias & Ciencias Comportamento, Hosp Clin, Av Bandeirantes 3900, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Osorio, Flavia L.; Crippa, Jose Alexandre S.; Zuardi, Antonio W.; Hallak, Jaime E.

Clinical studies administering psychedelics with psychotherapy have shown preliminary evidence of robust efficacy in treating anxiety and depression, as well as addiction to tobacco and alcohol. Moreover, recent research has suggested that these compounds have potential efficacy against inflammatory diseases through novel mechanisms, with potential advantages over existing antiinflammatory agents. We propose that psychedelics exert therapeutic effects for psychiatric disorders by acutely destabilizing local brain network hubs and global network connectivity via amplification of neuronal avalanches, providing the occasion for brain network resetting after the acute effects have resolved. Antiinflammatory effects may hold promise for efficacy in treatment of inflammation-related nonpsychiatric as well as potentially for psychiatric disorders. Serotonergic psychedelics operate through uniquemechanisms that show promising effects for a variety of intractable, debilitating, and lethal disorders, and should be rigorously researched.","[Nichols, D.

In healthy volunteers, acute administration of the serotonin 1A/2A/2C receptor agonist psilocybin reduces neural responses to negative stimuli and induces mood changes toward positive states. However, it is little-known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change. METHODS: This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin (.16 mg/kg) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart. RESULTS: Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration. The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression.","[Kraehenmann, Rainer; Scheidegger, Milan; Bosch, Oliver G.; Seifritz, Erich] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kraehenmann, Rainer; Preller, Katrin H.; Scheidegger, Milan; Pokorny, Thomas; Vollenweider, Franz X.] Univ Zurich, Dept Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Hosp Psychiat, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Scheidegger, Milan] Univ Zurich, Inst Biomed Engn, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland","Kraehenmann, R (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging, Hosp Psychiat, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",r.kraehenmann@bli.uzh.ch,"Preller, Katrin/AAD-8914-2019; Scheidegger, Milan/S-2358-2017","Scheidegger, Milan/0000-0003-1313-2208","Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, Switzerland; Heffter Research Institute, United States","The study was supported by grants from the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, Switzerland, and the Heffter Research Institute, United States.",,82,105,106,3,115,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Method: Twenty patients enrolled in an open-label trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression participated in a semistructured interview at 6-month follow-up. Thematic analysis was used to identify patients' experiences of the treatment and how it compared with previous treatments. Results: Two main change processes were identified in relation to the treatment. The first concerned change from disconnection (from self, others, and world) to connection, and the second concerned change from avoidance (of emotion) to acceptance. A third theme concerned comparison between psilocybin and conventional treatments. Patients reported that medications and some short-term talking therapies tended to reinforce their sense of disconnection and avoidance, whereas treatment with psilocybin encouraged connection and acceptance. Conclusions: These results suggest that psilocybin treatment for depression may work via paradigmatically novel means, antithetical to antidepressant medications, and some short-term talking therapies.","[Watts, Rosalind; Krzanowski, Jacob; Nutt, David; Carhart-Harris, Robin] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Day, Camilla] Imperial Coll London, Fac Med, Ctr Neuropsychopharmacol, Psychedel Res Grp,Brain Sci Div, London, England","Watts, R (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Imperial Psychedel Res Grp, Neuropsychopharmacol Unit, Burlington Danes Bldg,Hammersmith Campus, London W12 ONN, England.",ros.watts@yahoo.co.uk,,,"Medical Research Council, UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MRC: MR/J00460X/1]; Mosley Foundation [MRC: MR/J00460X/1]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Medical Research Council, UK; Mosley Foundation.

Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population). INTERVENTIONS Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of >= 17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR). RESULTS Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.0; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-3.6; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.0; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9-4.2; P < .001). In the overall sample, 16 participants (67%) at week 1 and 17 (71%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (>= 50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants (58%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54%) at week 4 were in remission (<= 7 GRID-HAMD score). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant depression.","[Davis, Alan K.; Barrett, Frederick S.; May, Darrick G.; Cosimano, Mary P.; Sepeda, Nathan D.; Johnson, Matthew W.; Finan, Patrick H.; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Davis, Alan K.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Social Work, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD USA","Davis, AK; Griffiths, RR (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",davis.5996@osu.edu; rgriff@jhmi.edu,"Davis, Alan/ABA-1813-2021",,"Riverstyx Foundation; Steven and Alexandra Cohen Foundation; NIDAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [T32DA07209, K23DA035915, R01DA03889]","This study was funded in part by a crowd-sourced funding campaign organized by TimFerriss; a grant from the Riverstyx Foundation; and grants from TimFerriss, Matt Mullenweg, Craig Nerenberg, BlakeMycoskie, and the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Foundation.

Classic psychedelics have been administered as sacraments since ancient times. They were of prominent interest within psychiatry and neuroscience in the 1950s to 1960s, and during this time contributed to the emergence of the field of molecular neuroscience. Promising results were reported for treatment of both end-of-life psychological distress and addiction, and classic psychedelics served as tools for studying the neurobiological bases of psychological disorders. Moreover, classic psychedelics were shown to occasion mystical experiences, which are subjective experiences reported throughout different cultures and religions involving a strong sense of unity, among other characteristics. However, the recreational use of classic psychedelics and their association with the counterculture prompted an end to human research with classic psychedelics in the early 1970s. We provide the most comprehensive review of epidemiological studies of classic psychedelics to date. Notable among these are a number of studies that have suggested the possibility that nonmedical naturalistic (non-laboratory) use of classic psychedelics is associated with positive mental health and prosocial outcomes, although it is clear that some individuals are harmed by classic psychedelics in non-supervised settings. We then review recent therapeutic studies suggesting efficacy in treating psychological distress associated with life-threatening diseases, treating depression, and treating nicotine and alcohol addictions. We also describe the construct of mystical experience, and provide a comprehensive review of modem studies investigating classic psychedelic-occasioned mystical experiences and their consequences. These studies have shown classic psychedelics to fairly reliably occasion mystical experiences. Moreover, classic-psychedelic-occasioned mystical experiences are associated with improved psychological outcomes in both healthy volunteer and patient populations. Finally, we review neuroimaging studies that suggest neurobiological mechanisms of classic psychedelics. These studies have also broadened our understanding of the brain, the serotonin system, and the neurobiological basis of consciousness. Overall, these various lines of research suggest that classic psychedelics might hold strong potential as therapeutics, and as tools for experimentally investigating mystical experiences and behavioral-brain function more generally.

In the last two decades, its use has expanded worldwide. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus beta-carboline alkaloids with monoamine-oxidase-inhibiting properties. Acute administration induces an introspective dream-like experience characterized by visions and autobiographic and emotional memories. Studies of long-term users have suggested its therapeutic potential, reporting that its use has helped individuals abandon the consumption of addictive drugs. Furthermore, recent open-label studies in patients with treatment-resistant depression found that a single ayahuasca dose induced a rapid antidepressant effect that was maintained weeks after administration. Here, we conducted an exploratory study of the psychological mechanisms that could underlie the beneficial effects of ayahuasca. We assessed a group of 25 individuals before and 24 h after an ayahuasca session using two instruments designed to measure mindfulness capacities: The Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ). Ayahuasca intake led to significant increases in two facets of the FFMQ indicating a reduction in judgmental processing of experiences and in inner reactivity. It also led to a significant increase in decentering ability as measured by the EQ. These changes are classic goals of conventional mindfulness training, and the scores obtained are in the range of those observed after extensive mindfulness practice. The present findings support the claim that ayahuasca has therapeutic potential and suggest that this potential is due to an increase in mindfulness capacities.","[Soler, Joaquim; Elices, Matilde; Pascual, Juan C.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Hosp Santa Creu & St Pau Barcelona, Serv Psiquiatria, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Soler, Joaquim] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Psicol Clin & Salut, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Soler, Joaquim; Elices, Matilde; Pascual, Juan C.; Riba, Jordi] CIBERSAM, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Madrid, Spain; [Elices, Matilde; Franquesa, Alba; Pascual, Juan C.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Psiquiatria & Med Legal, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Elices, Matilde] Univ Republica, Fac Psicol, Inst Fundamentos & Metodos, Programa Cognic, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Franquesa, Alba] Les Corts Ctr Higiene Mental, Barcelona, Spain; [Barker, Steven] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Vet Med, Dept Comparat Biomed Sci, Skip Bertman Dr River Rd, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Friedlander, Pablo; Feilding, Amanda] Beckley Fdn, Beckley Pk, Oxford OX3 9SY, England; [Riba, Jordi] Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Serv Farmacol Clin, Ctr Invest Medicaments, Barcelona, Spain; [Riba, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Riba, Jordi] St Pau Inst Biomed Res IIB St Pau, Human Neuropsychopharmacol Grp, C St Antoni Maria Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain","Riba, J (corresponding author), CIBERSAM, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Madrid, Spain.; Riba, J (corresponding author), Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Serv Farmacol Clin, Ctr Invest Medicaments, Barcelona, Spain.; Riba, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.; Riba, J (corresponding author), St Pau Inst Biomed Res IIB St Pau, Human Neuropsychopharmacol Grp, C St Antoni Maria Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain.",jriba@santpau.cat,"; Pascual, Juan C./M-2559-2014","Soler, Joaquim/0000-0001-8077-3641; Riba, Jordi/0000-0002-9375-8421; Pascual, Juan C./0000-0001-8039-9346; Elices, Matilde/0000-0002-7034-4242; Feilding, Amanda/0000-0002-1329-1893",Beckley Foundation,This study was supported by the Beckley Foundation.,,54,81,81,2,67,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,MAR,2016,233,5,10.1007/s00213-015-4162-0,,,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,DD9UX,WOS:000370272300009,26612618,,,,2021-12-21,

Here the hypothesis is revisited four years on from its original publication. It is shown that the principle that the entropy of brain activity is elevated in the psychedelic state is increasingly well supported by separate and independent studies and analyses, and evidence for greater brain criticality under psychedelics is also highlighted. It is argued that heightened brain criticality enables the brain to be more sensitive to intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations which may translate as a heightened susceptibility to set and setting. This updated version of the original entropic brain hypothesis now offers more concrete information on specific measures of brain entropy and suggests new studies to scrutinise it further, as well as examine its utility for describing and informing the treatment of psychiatric and neurological conditions such as depression and disorders of consciousness.

Experimentation and clinical trials undertaken prior to legal sanction suggest that they are not helpful for those with established psychotic disorders and should be avoided in those liable to develop them. However, those with so-called 'psychoneurotic' disorders sometimes benefited considerably from their tendency to 'loosen' otherwise fixed, maladaptive patterns of cognition and behaviour, particularly when given in a supportive, therapeutic setting. Pre-prohibition studies in this area were sub-optimal, although a recent systematic review in unipolar mood disorder and a meta-analysis in alcoholism have both suggested efficacy. The incidence of serious adverse events appears to be low. Since 2006, there have been several pilot trials and randomised controlled trials using psychedelics (mostly psilocybin) in various non-psychotic psychiatric disorders. These have provided encouraging results that provide initial evidence of safety and efficacy, however the regulatory and legal hurdles to licensing psychedelics as medicines are formidable. This paper summarises clinical trials using psychedelics pre and post prohibition, discusses the methodological challenges of performing good quality trials in this area and considers a strategic approach to the legal and regulatory barriers to licensing psychedelics as a treatment in mainstream psychiatry.

In the mid-twentieth century they were a focus within psychiatry as both probes of brain function and experimental therapeutics. By the late 1960s and early 1970s these scientific inquires fell out of favor because classic psychedelics were being used outside of medical research and in association with the emerging counter culture. However, in the twenty-first century, scientific interest in classic psychedelics has returned and grown as a result of several promising studies, validating earlier research. Here, we review therapeutic research on psilocybin, the classic psychedelic that has been the focus of most recent research. For mood and anxiety disorders, three controlled trials have suggested that psilocybin may decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychiatric distress for at least 6 months following a single acute administration. A small, open-label study in patients with treatment-resistant depression showed reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms 3 months after two acute doses. For addiction, small, open-label pilot studies have shown promising success rates for both tobacco and alcohol addiction. Safety data from these various trials, which involve careful screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up, indicate the absence of severe drug-related adverse reactions. Modest drug-related adverse effects at the time of medication administration are readily managed. US federal funding has yet to support therapeutic psilocybin research, although such support will be important to thoroughly investigate efficacy, safety, and therapeutic mechanisms.","[Johnson, Matthew W.; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Johnson, MW (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",mwj@jhu.edu,"Johnson, Matthew/AAA-3299-2020",,Heffter Research Institute; National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA003889]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA003889] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Support for effort by the authors has been provided by the Heffter Research Institute and National Institute on Drug Abuse grant R01DA003889.

The use of a variation of the tea that combines B. caapi with the leaves of the shrub Psychotria viridis has experienced unprecedented expansion worldwide for its psychotropic properties. This preparation contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from P. viridis, plus beta-carboline alkaloids with monoamine-oxidase-inhibiting properties from B. caapi. Acute administration induces a transient modified state of consciousness characterized by introspection, visions, enhanced emotions and recollection of personal memories. A growing body of evidence suggests that ayahuasca may be useful to treat substance use disorders, anxiety and depression. Here we review the pharmacology and neuroscience of ayahuasca, and the potential psychological mechanisms underlying its therapeutic potential. We discuss recent findings indicating that ayahuasca intake increases certain mindfulness facets related to acceptance and to the ability to take a detached view of one's own thoughts and emotions. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that ayahuasca shows promise as a therapeutic tool by enhancing self-acceptance and allowing safe exposure to emotional events. We postulate that ayahuasca could be of use in the treatment of impulse-related, personality and substance use disorders and also in the handling of trauma. More research is needed to assess the full potential of ayahuasca in the treatment of these disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain unknown. Methods: We therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02451072) during which 24 healthy human participants received either (i) placebo+placebo, (ii) placebo+LSD (100 mu g po), or (iii) Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist,+LSD. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared it to cortical gene expression maps. Findings: LSD reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory-somatomotor brain-wide and thalamic connectivity. Ketanserin fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. Whole-brain spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT2A receptor cortical gene expression in humans. Conclusion: Together, these results strongly implicate the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD's neuropharmacology. This study therefore pinpoints the critical role of 5-HT2A in LSD's mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics.

The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus beta-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the pattern/line meanings test (PLMT) and the picture concept test (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While convergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking increased. The present data indicate that ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahuasca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial initiatives.","[Kuypers, K. P. C.; Theunissen, E.

Despite a resurgence of quantitative research regarding psilocybin, the current study is the first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. Semistructured interviews were carried out with 13 adult participants aged 22 to 69 years (M = 50 years) with clinically elevated anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis. Participants received a moderate dose of psilocybin and adjunctive psychotherapy with an emphasis on the process of meaning-making. Verbatim transcribed interviews were analyzed by a five-member research team using interpretative phenomenological analysis. General themes found in all or nearly all transcripts included relational embeddedness, emotional range, the role of music as conveyor of experience, meaningful visual phenomena, wisdom lessons, revised life priorities, and a desire to repeat the psilocybin experience. Typical themes found in the majority of transcripts included the following: exalted feelings of joy, bliss, and love; embodiment; ineffability; alterations to identity; a movement from feelings of separateness to interconnectedness; experiences of transient psychological distress; the appearance of loved ones as guiding spirits; and sharing the experience with loved ones posttreatment. Variant themes found in a minority of participant transcripts include lasting changes to sense of identity, synesthesia experiences, catharsis of powerful emotion, improved relationships after treatment, surrender or letting go, forgiveness, and a continued struggle to integrate experience. The findings support the conclusion that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy may provide an effective treatment for psychological distress in cancer patients. Implications for theory and treatment are discussed.","[Belser, Alexander B.] NYU, Dept Appl Psychol, New York, NY USA; [Agin-Liebes, Gabrielle] Palo Alto Univ, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Swift, T.

Research suggests the potential safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress and substance use disorders, setting the occasion for this review. A more extensive assessment of abuse potential according to an 8 factor analysis would eventually be required to guide appropriate schedule placement. Psilocybin, like other 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelics, has limited reinforcing effects, supporting marginal, transient non-human self-administration. Nonetheless, mushrooms with variable psilocybin content are used illicitly, with a few lifetime use occasions being normative among users. Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders. However, scope of use and associated harms are low compared to prototypical abused drugs, and the medical model addresses these concerns with dose control, patient screening, preparation and follow-up, and session supervision in a medical facility. Conclusions: (1) psilocybin has an abuse potential appropriate for CSA scheduling if approved as medicine; (2) psilocybin can provide therapeutic benefits that may support the development of an approvable New Drug Application (NDA) but further studies are required which this review describes; (3) adverse effects of medical psilocybin are manageable when administered according to risk management approaches; and (4) although further study is required, this review suggests that placement in Schedule IV may be appropriate if a psilocybin-containing medicine is approved.

Here we report that harmine, tetrahydroharmine and harmaline, the three main alkaloids present in B. caapi, and the harmine metabolite harmol, stimulate adult neurogenesis in vitro. In neurospheres prepared from progenitor cells obtained from the subventricular and the subgranular zones of adult mice brains, all compounds stimulated neural stem cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation into adult neurons. These findings suggest that modulation of brain plasticity could be a major contribution to the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca.

Psychedelic effects are believed to emerge through stimulation of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) by psilocybin's active metabolite, psilocin. We here report for the first time the relationship between intensity of psychedelic effects, cerebral 5-HT2AR occupancy and plasma levels of psilocin in humans. Eight healthy volunteers underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the 5-HT2AR agonist radioligand [C-11] Cimbi-36: one at baseline and one or two additional scans on the same day after a single oral intake of psilocybin (3-30 mg). 5-HT2AR occupancy was calculated as the percent change in cerebral 5-HT2AR binding relative to baseline. Subjective psychedelic intensity and plasma psilocin levels were measured during the scans. Relations between subjective intensity, 5-HT2AR occupancy, and plasma psilocin levels were modeled using non-linear regression. Psilocybin intake resulted in dose-related 5-HT2AR occupancies up to 72%; plasma psilocin levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy conformed to a single-site binding model. Subjective intensity was correlated with both 5-HT2AR occupancy and psilocin levels as well as questionnaire scores. We report for the first time that intake of psilocybin leads to significant 5-HT2AR occupancy in the human brain, and that both psilocin plasma levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy are closely associated with subjective intensity ratings, strongly supporting that stimulation of 5-HT2AR is a key determinant for the psychedelic experience. Important for clinical studies, psilocin time-concentration curves varied but psilocin levels were closely associated with psychedelic experience.","[Madsen, Martin K.; Fisher, Patrick M.; Burmester, Daniel; Dyssegaard, Agnete; Stenbk, Dea S.; Kristiansen, Sara; Svarer, Claus; Ozenne, Brice; Knudsen, Gitte M.] Univ Copenhagen, Neurobiol Res Unit, Hosp Rigshosp, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Madsen, Martin K.; Burmester, Daniel; Knudsen, Gitte M.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Johansen, Sys S.; Linnet, Kristian] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Forens Med, Sect Forens Chem, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lehel, Sczabolz] Univ Copenhagen, PET & Cyclotron Unit, Hosp Rigshosp, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Erritzoe, David] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Psychiat, Dept Med, Div Brain Sci, London, England; [Ozenne, Brice] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Publ Hlth, Sect Biostat, Copenhagen, Denmark","Knudsen, GM (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Neurobiol Res Unit, Hosp Rigshosp, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",gmk@nru.dk,"Fisher, Patrick MacDonald/V-8158-2017; Knudsen, Gitte Moos/C-1368-2013","Fisher, Patrick MacDonald/0000-0002-8115-0611; Knudsen, Gitte Moos/0000-0003-1508-6866; Svarer, Claus/0000-0001-7811-1825; Erritzoe, David/0000-0002-7022-6211; Stenbaek, Dea/0000-0002-5439-4637; Linnet, Kristian/0000-0001-6974-5535; Burmester, Daniel/0000-0001-7215-4269; Johansen, Sys Stybe/0000-0002-9555-5134",Innovation Fund Denmark [4108-00004B]; Independent Research Fund Denmark [6110-00518B]; Ester M. og Konrad Kristian Sigurdssons Dyrevaernsfond [850-22-55166-17-LNG]; Rigshospitalet's Research Council [R130-A5324]; Lundbeck FoundationLundbeckfonden [R231-2016-3236]; Marie-Curie-NEUROMODEL [746850],"The study was supported by Innovation Fund Denmark (grant ID 4108-00004B), Independent Research Fund Denmark (grant ID 6110-00518B), and Ester M. og Konrad Kristian Sigurdssons Dyrevaernsfond (grant ID 850-22-55166-17-LNG).

Methods: Papers published until 3 April 2015 were retrieved from the PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and using a predetermined set of criteria for article selection. Results: Five hundred and fourteen studies were identified, of which 21 met the established criteria. Studies in animals have shown anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca, harmine, and harmaline, and experimental studies in humans and mental health assessments of experienced ayahuasca consumers also suggest that ayahuasca is associated with reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. A pilot study reported rapid antidepressive effects of a single ayahuasca dose in six patients with recurrent depression. Conclusion: Considering the need for new drugs that produce fewer adverse effects and are more effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptomatology, the described effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids should be further investigated.","[dos Santos, Rafael G.; Osorio, Flavia L.; Crippa, Jose Alexandre S.; HaIlak, Jaime E.

How psychedelics mediate their actions-both therapeutic and hallucinogenic-are not understood, although activation of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (HTR2A) is key. To gain molecular insights into psychedelic actions, we determined the active-state structure of HTR2A bound to 25-CN-NBOH-a prototypical hallucinogen-in complex with an engineered G alpha q heterotrimer by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We also obtained the X-ray crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with the arrestin-biased ligand LSD or the inverse agonist methiothepin. Comparisons of these structures reveal determinants responsible for HTR2A-G alpha q protein interactions as well as the conformational rearrangements involved in active-state transitions. Given the potential therapeutic actions of hallucinogens, these findings could accelerate the discovery of more selective drugs for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.","[Kim, Kuglae; Che, Tao; DiBerto, Jeffrey F.; Krumm, Brian E.; Wacker, Daniel; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Panova, Ouliana; Robertson, Michael J.; Seven, Alpay B.; Skiniotis, Georgios] Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Dept Struct Biol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lyu, Jiankun; Shoichet, Brian K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Nichols, David E.; Roth, Bryan L.] Univ N Carolina, Eshelman Sch Pharm, Div Chem Biol & Med Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wacker, Daniel] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Wacker, Daniel] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Che, Tao] Washington Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis Sch Med, St Louis Coll Pharm, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Che, Tao] Washington Univ, Ctr Clin Pharmacol, St Louis Coll Pharm, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Roth, BL (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.; Skiniotis, G (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Dept Struct Biol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Roth, BL (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Eshelman Sch Pharm, Div Chem Biol & Med Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yiorgo@stanford.edu; bryan_roth@med.unc.edu,"Roth, Bryan L/F-3928-2010; Roth, Bryan/ABE-7032-2020","Roth, Bryan/0000-0002-0561-6520; Che, Tao/0000-0002-1620-3027; Lyu, Jiankun/0000-0002-0461-5454; Seven, Alpay/0000-0001-6212-9908; Robertson, Michael/0000-0003-2610-680X; Panova, Ouliana/0000-0002-5089-620X","National Cancer InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA016086, ACB12002]; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [AGM-12006]; DOE Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Korea Research Foundation (KRF)Korea Research Foundation [2017R1A6A3A03012547]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R37DA04567, R01MH112205, R35GM122481]; DARPAUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [HR0011-20-2-0029]","We thank M.J.

Individuals who microdose report minimal acute effects from these substances yet claim a range of long-term general health and wellbeing benefits. There have been no published empirical studies of microdosing and the current legal and bureaucratic climate makes direct empirical investigation of the effects of psychedelics difficult. In Study One we conducted a systematic, observational investigation of individuals who microdose. We tracked the experiences of 98 microdosing participants, who provided daily ratings of psychological functioning over a six week period. 63 of these additionally completed a battery of psychometric measures tapping mood, attention, wellbeing, mystical experiences, personality, creativity, and sense of agency, at baseline and at completion of the study. Analyses of daily ratings revealed a general increase in reported psychological functioning across all measures on dosing days but limited evidence of residual effects on following days. Analyses of pre and post study measures revealed reductions in reported levels of depression and stress; lower levels of distractibility; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. To better understand these findings, in Study Two we investigated pre-existing beliefs and expectations about the effects of microdosing in a sample of 263 naive and experienced microdosers, so as to gauge expectancy bias. All participants believed that microdosing would have large and wide-ranging benefits in contrast to the limited outcomes reported by actual microdosers. Notably, the effects believed most likely to change were unrelated to the observed pattern of reported outcomes. The current results suggest that dose controlled empirical research on the impacts of microdosing on mental health and attentional capabilities are needed.","[Polito, Vince] Macquarie Univ, Dept Cognit Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Stevenson, Richard J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Polito, V (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Cognit Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",vince.polito@mq.edu.au,"Polito, Vince/A-7348-2011","Polito, Vince/0000-0003-3242-9074; Stevenson, Richard/0000-0002-2461-5777",,,,108,57,57,6,46,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,FEB 6,2019,14,2,10.1371/journal.pone.0211023,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,HK4EL,WOS:000457874000043,30726251,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2021-12-21,

Twenty patients with moderate or severe, unipolar, TRD received oral psilocybin (10 and 25mg, one week apart) in a supportive setting. Personality was assessed at baseline and at 3-month follow-up using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), the subjective psilocybin experience with Altered State of Consciousness (ASC) scale, and depressive symptoms with QIDS-SR16. ResultsConclusionNeuroticism scores significantly decreased while Extraversion increased following psilocybin therapy. These changes were in the direction of the normative NEO-PI-R data and were both predicted, in an exploratory analysis, by the degree of insightfulness experienced during the psilocybin session. Openness scores also significantly increased following psilocybin, whereas Conscientiousness showed trend-level increases, and Agreeableness did not change. Our observation of changes in personality measures after psilocybin therapy was mostly consistent with reports of personality change in relation to conventional antidepressant treatment, although the pronounced increases in Extraversion and Openness might constitute an effect more specific to psychedelic therapy. This needs further exploration in future controlled studies, as do the brain mechanisms of postpsychedelic personality change.","[Erritzoe, D.; Roseman, L.; Kaelen, M.; Nutt, D.

Acute administration leads to neurophysiological modifications in brain regions of the default mode network, purportedly through a glutamatergic mechanism. Post-acutely, ayahuasca potentiates mindfulness capacities in volunteers and induces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients. However, the mechanisms underlying these fast and maintained effects are poorly understood. Here, we investigated in an open-label uncontrolled study in 16 healthy volunteers ayahuasca-induced post-acute neurometabolic and connectivity modifications and their association with mindfulness measures. Methods: Using H-1-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional connectivity, we compared baseline and post-acute neurometabolites and seed-to-voxel connectivity in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex after a single ayahuasca dose. Results: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed post-acute reductions in glutamate+glutamine, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate in the posterior cingulate cortex. Connectivity was increased between the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and between the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic structures in the right medial temporal lobe. Glutamate+glutamine reductions correlated with increases in the nonjudging subscale of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Increased anterior cingulate cortex-medial temporal lobe connectivity correlated with increased scores on the self-compassion questionnaire. Post-acute neural changes predicted sustained elevations in nonjudging 2 months later. Conclusions: These results support the involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the effects of psychedelics in humans. They further suggest that neurometabolic changes in the posterior cingulate cortex, a key region within the default mode network, and increased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobe structures involved in emotion and memory potentially underlie the post-acute psychological effects of ayahuasca.","[Sampedro, Frederic] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Sch Med, Barcelona, Spain; [de la Fuente Revenga, Mario; Roberto, Natalia; Riba, Jordi] St Pau Inst Biomed Res, Neuropsychopharmacol Res Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Valle, Marta] St Pau Inst Biomed Res, Pharmacokinet & Pharmacodynam Modelling & Simulat, Barcelona, Spain; [Valle, Marta; Riba, Jordi] Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Serv Farmacol Clin, Ctr Invest Medicaments, Barcelona, Spain; [Valle, Marta; Elices, Matilde; Alvarez, Enrique; Soler, Joaquim; Pascual, Juan C.; Riba, Jordi] CIBERSAM, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Madrid, Spain; [Valle, Marta] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Barcelona, Spain; [Dominguez-Clave, Elisabet; Elices, Matilde; Alvarez, Enrique; Soler, Joaquim; Pascual, Juan C.] Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Dept Psychiat, Barcelona, Spain; [Dominguez-Clave, Elisabet; Elices, Matilde; Alvarez, Enrique; Pascual, Juan C.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Forens Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Eduardo Luna, Luis] Res Ctr Study Psychointegrator Plants Visionary A, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Crippa, Jose Alexandre S.; Hallak, Jaime E.

Music is considered an important component in the treatment model, but little empirical research has been done to examine the magnitude and nature of its therapeutic role. The present study assessed the influence of music on the acute experience and clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy. Semi-structured interviews inquired about the different ways in which music influenced the experience of 19 patients undergoing psychedelic therapy with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to the interview data to identify salient themes. In addition, ratings were given for each patient for the extent to which they expressed liking, resonance (the music being experienced as harmonious with the emotional state of the listener), and openness (acceptance of the music-evoked experience). Analyses of the interviews revealed that the music had both welcome and unwelcome influences on patients' subjective experiences. Welcome influences included the evocation of personally meaningful and therapeutically useful emotion and mental imagery, a sense of guidance, openness, and the promotion of calm and a sense of safety. Conversely, unwelcome influences included the evocation of unpleasant emotion and imagery, a sense of being misguided and resistance. Correlation analyses showed that patients' experience of the music was associated with the occurrence of mystical experiences and insightfulness. Crucially, the nature of the music experience was significantly predictive of reductions in depression 1 week after psilocybin, whereas general drug intensity was not.

Responses to items from several hallucinogen-sensitive questionnaires (Hallucinogen Rating Scale, the States of Consciousness Questionnaire, and the Five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire) in an Internet survey of challenging experiences with the classic hallucinogen psilocybin were used to construct and validate a Challenging Experience Questionnaire. The stand-alone Challenging Experience Questionnaire was then validated in a separate sample. Seven Challenging Experience Questionnaire factors (grief, fear, death, insanity, isolation, physical distress, and paranoia) provide a phenomenological profile of challenging aspects of experiences with psilocybin. Factor scores were associated with difficulty, meaningfulness, spiritual significance, and change in well-being attributed to the challenging experiences. The factor structure did not differ based on gender or prior struggle with anxiety or depression.

Although several pharmacological treatments are available, they are not effective for a significant proportion of patients and are associated with several adverse reactions. Therefore, new treatments should be explored. Recent studies suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics including ayahuasca, psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects. Areas Covered: A systematic review of systematic reviews assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelic was performed using the PubMed data base until 11 April 2018. Systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis were analyzed, but only reviews that described at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) were included. Expert Commentary: Psilocybin and LSD reduced anxiety and depression in cancer patients and symptoms of alcohol and tobacco dependence, and ayahuasca reduced depression symptoms in treatment-resistant depression. Although the results are promising, several studies were open label, and only few were RCTs, and most had small sample sizes and a short duration. Single or few doses of these drugs seem to be well tolerated, but long-term studies are lacking. New RCTs with bigger samples and longer duration are needed to replicate these findings.","[dos Santos, Rafael G.; Carlos Bouso, Jose] ICEERS Fdn Int Ctr Ethnobot Educ Res & Serv, Barcelona, Spain; [dos Santos, Rafael G.; Hallak, Jaime E.

Increasing evidence indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of mental health disorders and can enhance mindfulness-related capacities. Most research so far has focused on acute and sub-acute effects of ayahuasca on mental health-related parameters and less on long-term effects. Objectives The present study aimed to assess sub-acute and long-term effects of ayahuasca on well-being and cognitive thinking style. The second objective was to assess whether sub-acute and long-term effects of ayahuasca depend on the degree of ego dissolution that was experienced after consumption of ayahuasca. Results Ayahuasca ceremony attendants (N = 57) in the Netherlands and Colombia were assessed before, the day after, and 4 weeks following the ritual. Relative to baseline, ratings of depression and stress significantly decreased after the ayahuasca ceremony and these changes persisted for 4 weeks. Likewise, convergent thinking improved post-ayahuasca ceremony up until the 4 weeks follow-up. Satisfaction with life and several aspects of mindfulness increased the day after the ceremony, but these changes failed to reach significance 4 weeks after. Changes in affect, satisfaction with life, and mindfulness were significantly correlated to the level of ego dissolution experienced during the ayahuasca ceremony and were unrelated to previous experience with ayahuasca. Conclusion It is concluded that ayahuasca produces sub-acute and long-term improvements in affect and cognitive thinking style in non-pathological users. These data highlight the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as depression.","[Uthaug, M. V.; Kuypers, K. P. C.; van Boxtel, M.; Mason, N.

It is rich in the tryptamine hallucinogens dimethyltryptamine [DMT], which acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A agonist. This mechanism of action is similar to other compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin. The controlled use of LSD and psilocybin in experimental settings is associated with a low incidence of psychotic episodes, and population studies corroborate these findings. Both the controlled use of DMT in experimental settings and the use of ayahuasca in experimental and ritual settings are not usually associated with psychotic episodes, but little is known regarding ayahuasca or DMT use outside these controlled contexts. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the published case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca and DMT intake. We found three case series and two case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca intake, and three case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with DMT. Several reports describe subjects with a personal and possibly a family history of psychosis [including schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, psychotic mania, psychotic depression], nonpsychotic mania, or concomitant use of other drugs. However, some cases also described psychotic episodes in subjects without these previous characteristics. Overall, the incidence of such episodes appears to be rare in both the ritual and the recreational/noncontrolled settings. Performance of a psychiatric screening before administration of these drugs, and other hallucinogens, in controlled settings seems to significantly reduce the possibility of adverse reactions with psychotic symptomatology. Individuals with a personal or family history of any psychotic illness or nonpsychotic mania should avoid hallucinogen intake.","[dos Santos, Rafael G.; Hallak, Jaime E.

These drugs act as agonists of frontocortical 5-HT2A receptors, but the neural basis of their effects are not well understood. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of neuroimaging studies analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens in man. Studies published in the PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO databases until 12 April 2016 were included using the following keywords: ayahuasca, DMT, psilocybin, LSD, mescaline crossed one by one with the terms mri, fmri, pet, spect, imaging and neuroimaging. Of 279 studies identified, 25 were included. Acute effects included excitation of frontolateral/frontomedial cortex, medial temporal lobe, and occipital cortex, and inhibition of the default mode network. Long-term use was associated with thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, thickening of the anterior cingulate cortex, and decreased neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding. Despite the high methodological heterogeneity and the small sample sizes, the results suggest that hallucinogens increase introspection and positive mood by modulating brain activity in the fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital cortex.

Current treatment is suboptimal in most cases and there is little of note in the pharmaceutical development pipeline. The psychedelic drugs, including lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, were used extensively in the treatment of mood disorders, and other psychiatric conditions, before their prohibition in the late 1960s. They are relatively safe when used in medically controlled environments, with no reported risk of dependence. Here, we present a systematic review of published clinical treatment studies using psychedelics in patients with broadly defined UMD, and consider their place in psychiatry. Whilst all of the included studies have methodological shortcomings, of 423 individuals in 19 studies, 335 (79.2%) showed clinician-judged improvement after treatment with psychedelics. A recently completed pilot study in the UK favours the use of psilocybin with psychological support in treatment resistant depressive disorder. The evidence overall strongly suggests that psychedelics should be re-examined in modern clinical trials for their use in unipolar mood disorders and other non-psychotic mental health conditions.","[Rucker, James J.

METHODS In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of <= 5) at week 6. RESULTS A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (+/- SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0 +/- 1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0 +/- 1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P=0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients.

Design: Respondents (n = 21) were recruited at several Internet fora for individual interviews via private messaging. Every participant was male, and the median respondent was in his 30s with a stable job and relationship and extensive entheogen experience. Results: Respondents tended to experiment with microdosing in phases, reporting mostly positive consequences from this form of drug use. Reported effects included improved mood, cognition, and creativity, which often served to counteract symptoms especially from conditions of anxiety and depression. There were also reports of various challenges with psychedelic microdosing, and some did not find the practice worth continuing. Conclusion: The study obtained evidence of a group of users taking small doses of psychedelics not for the purpose of intoxication but to enhance everyday functioning.

Recently, after a long hiatus period of regulatory obstacles, interest in the clinical use of these substances has resumed. The current article provides a systematic review of studies investigating psychedelics in the treatment of symptoms of existential distress in life-threatening diseases across different periods of research, highlighting how underlying concepts have developed over time. A systematic search for clinical trials from 1960 to 2017 revealed 11 eligible clinical trials involving a total number of N = 445 participants, of which 7 trials investigated the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (N = 323), 3 trials investigated the use of psilocybin (N = 92), and one trial investigated the use of dipropyltryptamine (DPT) (N = 30). The 4 more recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 104) showed a significantly higher methodological quality than studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s. Evidence supports that patients with life threatening diseases associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety benefit from the anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of serotonergic hallucinogens. Some studies anecdotally reported improvements in patients' quality of life and reduced fear of death. Moreover, low rates of side effects were reported in studies that adhered to safety guidelines. Further studies are needed to determine how these results can be transferred into clinical practice.","[Reiche, Simon] Charite, Berlin, Germany; [Hermle, Leo] Clin Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Christophsbad, Goppingen, Germany; [Gutwinski, Stefan; Majic, Tomislav] Charite, Psychiat Univ Hosp Charite St Hedwig, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Campus Mitte, Grosse Hamburger Str 5-11, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Jungaberle, Henrik] MIND European Fdn Psychedel Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Gasser, Peter] Med Off Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Solothurn, Switzerland","Majic, T (corresponding author), Charite, Psychiat Univ Hosp Charite St Hedwig, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Campus Mitte, Grosse Hamburger Str 5-11, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",tomislav.majic@charite.de,"Jungaberle, Henrik/AAV-6941-2021; Jungaberle, Henrik/G-4038-2013","Jungaberle, Henrik/0000-0001-7634-4211; Reiche, Simon/0000-0001-7424-2262",,,,113,46,46,3,200,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0278-5846,1878-4216,,PROG NEURO-PSYCHOPH,Prog.

Twenty healthy volunteers participated in a placebo-controlled crossover study, incorporating intravenous administration of LSD (75 g) and placebo (saline) prior to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Six independent, blind judges analysed mentation reports acquired during structured interviews performed shortly after the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans (approximately 2.5 h post-administration). Within each report, specific linguistic references to mental spaces for the past, present and future were identified. Results revealed significantly fewer mental spaces for the past under LSD and this effect correlated with the general intensity of the drug's subjective effects. No differences in the number of mental spaces for the present or future were observed. Consistent with the previously proposed role of the default-mode network (DMN) in autobiographical memory recollection and ruminative thought, decreased resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the DMN correlated with decreased mental time travel to the past. These results are discussed in relation to potential therapeutic applications of LSD and related psychedelics, e.g. in the treatment of depression, for which excessive reflection on one's past, likely mediated by DMN functioning, is symptomatic.","[Speth, Jana; Speth, Clemens; Schloerscheidt, Astrid M.] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Dept Psychol, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Kaelen, Mendel; Nutt, David J.; Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Neuropsychopharmacol, London, England; [Feilding, Amanda] Beckley Fdn, Oxford, England","Speth, J (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Dept Psychol, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",j.speth@dundee.ac.uk,,,Safra Foundation; Beckley Foundation; Walacea crowd-funding campaign; Medical Research Council (MRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: his research received financial support from the Safra Foundation (who fund DJN), the Beckley Foundation (it was conducted as part of the Beckley-Imperial research programme) and the Walacea crowd-funding campaign.

Aim: Here we sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin on nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This open-label pilot study with a mixed-model design studied the effects of psilocybin on measures of nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with moderate to severe TRD (n=7) versus age-matched non-treated healthy control subjects (n=7). Psilocybin was administered in two oral dosing sessions (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart. Main outcome measures were collected 1 week and 7-12 months after the second dosing session. Nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective were assessed using the Nature Relatedness Scale (NR-6) and Political Perspective Questionnaire (PPQ-5), respectively. Results: Nature relatedness significantly increased (t(6)=-4.242, p=0.003) and authoritarianism significantly decreased (t(6)=2.120, p=0.039) for the patients 1 week after the dosing sessions. At 7-12 months post-dosing, nature relatedness remained significantly increased (t(5)=-2.707, p=0.021) and authoritarianism remained decreased at trend level (t(5)=-1.811, p=0.065). No differences were found on either measure for the non-treated healthy control subjects. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that psilocybin with psychological support might produce lasting changes in attitudes and beliefs. Although it would be premature to infer causality from this small study, the possibility of drug-induced changes in belief systems seems sufficiently intriguing and timely to deserve further investigation.","[Lyons, Taylor; Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, Psychedel Res Grp, London, England","Lyons, T (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Psychiat, Dept Med, Psychedel Res Grp, London W12 0NN, England.",t.lyons15@imperial.ac.uk,"Lyons, Taylor/AAM-7410-2020","Lyons, Taylor/0000-0002-3118-7344; Carhart-Harris, Robin/0000-0002-6062-7150",Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/J00460X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by Medical Research Council.",,86,44,44,9,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0269-8811,1461-7285,,J PSYCHOPHARMACOL,J.

Salvinorin A is a selective high efficacy kappa-opioid receptor (KOPr) agonist, and thus implicates the KOPr system and its endogenous agonist ligands (the dynorphins) in higher functions, including cognition and perceptual effects. Salvinorin A is the only selective KOPr ligand to be widely available outside research or medical settings, and salvinorin A-containing products have undergone frequent nonmedical use. KOPr/dynorphin systems in the brain are known to be powerful countermodulatory mechanisms to dopaminergic function, which is important in mood and reward engendered by natural and chemical reinforcers (including drugs of abuse). KOPr activation (including by salvinorin A) can thus cause aversion and anhedonia in preclinical models. Salvinorin A is also a completely new scaffold for medicinal chemistry approaches, since it is a non-nitrogenous neoclerodane, unlike other known opioid ligands. Ongoing efforts have the goal of discovering novel semi-synthetic salvinorin analogs with potential KOPr-mediated pharmacotherapeutic effects (including partial agonist or biased agonist effects), with a reduced burden of undesirable effects associated with salvinorin A.","[Butelman, Eduardo R.; Kreek, Mary Jeanne] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Biol Addict Dis, New York, NY 10065 USA","Butelman, ER (corresponding author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Biol Addict Dis, 1230 York Ave,Box 171, New York, NY 10065 USA.",butelme@rockefeller.edu,,,"NIH-NIDA grants [DA018151, DA05130, DA017369]; Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Thus, it is important to analyze the acute, subacute, and long-term effects of AYA to assess its safety and toxicity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of human studies assessing AYA effects on psychiatric symptoms, neuropsychological functioning, and neuroimaging. Methods: Papers published until 16 December 2015 were included from PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and pre-determined set of criteria for article selection. Results: The review included 28 full-text articles. Acute AYA administration was well tolerated, increased introspection and positive mood, altered visual perceptions, activated frontal and paralimbic regions and decreased default mode network activity. It also improved planning and inhibitory control and impaired working memory, and showed antidepressive and antiaddictive potentials. Long-term AYA use was associated with increased cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex and cortical thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, which was inversely correlated to age of onset, intensity of prior AYA use, and spirituality. Subacute and long-term AYA use was not associated with increased psychopathology or cognitive deficits, being associated with enhanced mood and cognition, increased spirituality, and reduced impulsivity. Conclusions: Acute, subacute, and long-term AYA use seems to have low toxicity. Preliminary studies about potential therapeutic effects of AYA need replication due to their methodological limitations.","[dos Santos, Rafael G.; Hallak, Jaime E.

We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing. However, it is still not known whether psilocybin modulates bottom-up or top-down connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network underlying threat processing. We therefore analyzed our previous fMRI data using dynamic causal modeling and used Bayesian-model selection to infer how psilocybin modulated effective connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network during threat processing. First, both placebo and psilocybin data were best explained by a model in which threat affect modulated bidirectional connections between the primary visual cortex, amygdala, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Second, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex, speaking to a neural mechanism that might underlie putative shifts towards positive affect states after psilocybin administration. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Much emphasis has been placed on the occurrence of mystical-type experiences in determining long-term responses to psychedelics yet here we demonstrate the importance of another component, namely: emotional breakthrough. Methods: Three hundred and seventy-nine participants completed online surveys before and after a planned psychedelic experience. Items pertaining to emotional breakthrough were completed one day after the psychedelic experience, as were items comprising the already validated Mystical Experience Questionnaire and the Challenging Experience Questionnaire. Emotional breakthrough, Mystical Experience Questionnaire and Challenging Experience Questionnaire scores were used to predict changes in well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale) in a subsample of 75 participants with low well-being baseline scores (<= 45). Results: Factor analyses revealed six emotional breakthrough items with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.932) and supported our prior hypothesis that emotional breakthrough is a distinct component of the psychedelic experience. Emotional breakthrough scores behaved dose-dependently, and were higher if the psychedelic was taken with therapeutic planning and intent. Emotional breakthrough, Mystical Experience Questionnaire and Challenging Experience Questionnaire scores combined, significantly predicted subsequent changes in well-being (r=0.45, p=0.0005, n=75), with each scale contributing significant predictive value. Emotional breakthrough and Mystical Experience Questionnaire scores predicted increases in well-being and Challenging Experience Questionnaire scores predicted less increases.

Emotional breakthrough is an important and distinct component of the acute psychedelic experience that appears to be a key mediator of subsequent longer-term psychological changes.

Traditional antidepressants often take weeks to months to positively affect mood and are ineffective for about 30% of the population. Alternatives, such as ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic capable of producing hallucinations, and the psychoactive tisane ayahuasca, have shown great promise due to their fast-acting nature and effectiveness in treatment-resistant populations. Here, we investigate the effects of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the principle hallucinogenic component of ayahuasca, in rodent behavioral assays relevant to anxiety and depression using adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats. We find that while DMT elicits initial anxiogenic responses in several of these paradigms, its long-lasting effects tend to reduce anxiety by facilitating the extinction of cued fear memory. Furthermore, DMT reduces immobility in the forced swim test, which is a characteristic behavioral response induced by many antidepressants. Our results demonstrate that DMT produces antidepressant and anxiolytic behavioral effects in rodents, warranting further investigation of ayahuasca and classical psychedelics as treatments for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.","[Cameron, Lindsay P.] Univ Calif Davis, Neurosci Grad Program, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Benson, Charlie J.; Dunlap, Lee E.; Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, Davis, CA 95817 USA; [Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95618 USA","Olson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",deolson@ucdavis.edu,,"Olson, David/0000-0002-4517-0543",UC Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute; National Science Foundation Predoctoral FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1650042]; NIH T32 grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5T32MH082174-09]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [U54HD079125] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH082174] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by the UC Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute, a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship (#1650042 to C.J.B.), and an NIH T32 grant (5T32MH082174-09 to L.P.C.).",,77,41,42,5,34,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7193,,,ACS CHEM NEUROSCI,ACS Chem.

These effects are consistent both with the known actions of LSD on serotonin receptors and with limited evidence that higher doses of LSD (100-200 mu g) positively bias emotion processing. Yet, the effects of such subthreshold doses of LSD have not been tested in a controlled laboratory setting. As a first step, we examined the effects of single very low doses of LSD (0-26 mu g) on mood and behavior in healthy volunteers under double-blind conditions. METHODS: Healthy young adults (N = 20) attended 4 laboratory sessions during which they received 0 (placebo), 6.5, 13, or 26 mu g of LSD in randomized order at 1-week intervals. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing and cognition. Cardiovascular measures and body temperature were also assessed. RESULTS: LSD produced dose-related subjective effects across the 3 doses (6.5, 13, and 26 mu g). At the highest dose, the drug also increased ratings of vigor and slightly decreased positivity ratings of images with positive emotional content. Other mood measures, cognition, and physiological measures were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Single microdoses of LSD produced orderly dose-related subjective effects in healthy volunteers. These findings indicate that a threshold dose of 13 mu g of LSD might be used safely in an investigation of repeated administrations. It remains to be determined whether the drug improves mood or cognition in individuals with symptoms of depression.","[Bershad, Anya K.; Schepers, Scott T.; Bremmer, Michael P.; Lee, Royce; de Wit, Harriet] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC3077, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bershad, Anya K.] Univ Chicago, Interdisciplinary Scientist Training Program, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","de Wit, H (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC3077, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",hdew@uchicago.edu,,"de Wit, Harriet/0000-0002-7211-8994","National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [2T32GM007281]; National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [T32DA043469, DA02812]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM007281] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA002812, T32DA043469] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by a training grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (Grant No. 2T32GM007281 [to AKB]) and grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Grant No. T32DA043469 [to STS] and Grant No. DA02812 [to HdW]).,,50,40,40,3,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Recent studies on full-dose psychedelic psychotherapy reveal promising benefits for mental well-being, especially for depression and end-of-life anxiety. While full-dose therapies include perception-distorting properties, microdosing mayprovide complementary clinical benefits using lower-risk, non-hallucinogenic doses.ObjectivesThis pre-registered study aimed to investigate whether microdosing psychedelics is related to differences in personality, mental health, and creativity.MethodsIn this observational study, respondents recruited from online forums self-reported their microdosing behaviors and completed questionnaires concerning dysfunctional attitudes, wisdom, negative emotionality, open-mindedness, and mood. Respondents also performed the Unusual Uses Task to assess their creativity.ResultsCurrent and former microdosers scored lower on measures of dysfunctional attitudes (p < 0.001, r = - 0.92) and negative emotionality (p = 0.009, r = - 0.85) and higher on wisdom (p < 0.001, r = 0.88), openmindedness(p = 0.027, r = 0.67), and creativity (p < 0.001, r = 0.15) when compared to non-microdosing controls.ConclusionsThese findings provide promising initial evidence that warrants controlled experimental research to directly test safety and clinical efficacy. As microdoses are easier to administer than full-doses, this new paradigm has the exciting potential to shape future psychedelic research.","[Anderson, Thomas; Farb, Norman A.

Some studies have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala responses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala responses (Ma, 2015). We hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be altered post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study, 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe, treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing sessions with psilocybin. Psychological support was provided before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI scans one week prior to the first session and one day after the second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces were presented in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group results revealed rapid and enduring improvements in depressive symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment, and right amygdala increases to fearful versus neutral faces were predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with psychological support was associated with increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to previous findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in these treatments' therapeutic actions, with SSRIs mitigating negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront and work through them. Based on the present results, we propose that psilocybin with psychological support is a treatment approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in depression, enabling patients to reconnect with their emotions.

Results suggested that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy facilitated improvements in psychiatric and existential distress, quality of life, and spiritual well-being up to seven weeks prior to the crossover. At the 6.5-month follow-up, after the crossover, 60-80% of participants continued to meet criteria for clinically significant antidepressant or anxiolytic responses. Methods: The present study is a long-term within-subjects follow-up analysis of self-reported symptomatology involving a subset of participants that completed the parent trial. All 16 participants who were still alive were contacted, and 15 participants agreed to participate at an average of 3.2 and 4.5 years following psilocybin administration. Results: Reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety were sustained at the first and second follow-ups. Within-group effect sizes were large. At the second (4.5 year) follow-up approximately 60-80% of participants met criteria for clinically significant antidepressant or anxiolytic responses. Participants overwhelmingly (71-100%) attributed positive life changes to the psilocybin-assisted therapy experience and rated it among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives. Conclusion: These findings suggest that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy holds promise in promoting long-term relief from cancer-related psychiatric distress. Limited conclusions, however, can be drawn regarding the efficacy of this therapy due to the crossover design of the parent study. Nonetheless, the present study adds to the emerging literature base suggesting that psilocybin-facilitated therapy may enhance the psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being of patients with life-threatening cancer.","[Agin-Liebes, Gabrielle, I; Yalch, Matthew M.] Palo Alto Univ, 1791 Arastradero Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Agin-Liebes, Gabrielle, I; Malone, Tara; Mennenga, Sarah E.; Guss, Jeffrey; Bossis, Anthony P.; Ross, Stephen] NYU, Psychedel Res Grp, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY USA; [Malone, Tara; Guss, Jeffrey; Bossis, Anthony P.; Ross, Stephen] NYU Langone Hlth, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Ponte, K.

Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression.

To better understand these findings, we sought to identify psychological mechanisms of action using qualitative methods to study patient experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 adult participants with clinically elevated anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis who received a single dose of psilocybin under close clinical supervision. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which resulted in 10 themes, focused specifically on cancer, death and dying, and healing narratives. Participants spoke to the anxiety and trauma related to cancer, and perceived lack of available emotional support. Participants described the immersive and distressing effects of the psilocybin session, which led to reconciliations with death, an acknowledgment of cancer's place in life, and emotional uncoupling from cancer. Participants made spiritual or religious interpretations of their experience, and the psilocybin therapy helped facilitate a felt reconnection to life, a reclaiming of presence, and greater confidence in the face of cancer recurrence. Implications for theory and clinical treatment are discussed.","[Swift, Thomas C.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Belser, Alexander B.] NYU, Dept Appl Psychol, New York, NY USA; [Belser, Alexander B.] NYU, Psychedel Res Grp, New York, NY USA; [Belser, Alexander B.] NYU, Psilocybin Alcohol Dependence Qualitat Study, New York, NY USA; [Guss, Jeffrey] NYU, Sch Med, New York, NY USA; [Bossis, Anthony P.] NYU, Sch Med, Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Ross, Stephen] NYU, Sch Med, Psychiat & Child & Adolescent Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Agin-Liebes, Gabrielle] Palo Alto Univ, Early Intervent Clin EIC Lab, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Devenot, Nese] Univ Puget Sound, Digital Humanities, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA; [Terrana, Sara] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Friedman, Harris L.] Goddard Coll, Plainfield, VT USA; [Friedman, Harris L.] Univ Florida, Psychol, Gainesville, FL USA","Swift, TC (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Sch Med, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",cody@riverstyxfoundation.org,"Agin-Liebes, Gabrielle/AAQ-7978-2021",,Heffter Research Institute,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by grants from the Heffter Research Institute.",,43,39,39,3,69,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-1678,1552-650X,,J HUMANIST PSYCHOL,J.

Acute psilocybin effects include reduced negative mood, increased positive mood, and reduced amygdala response to negative affective stimuli. However, no study has investigated the long-term, enduring impact of psilocybin on negative affect and associated brain function. Twelve healthy volunteers (7F/5M) completed an open-label pilot study including assessments 1-day before, 1-week after, and 1-month after receiving a 25 mg/70 kg dose of psilocybin to test the hypothesis that psilocybin administration leads to enduring changes in affect and neural correlates of affect. One-week post-psilocybin, negative affect and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli were reduced, whereas positive affect and dorsal lateral prefrontal and medial orbitofrontal cortex responses to emotionally-conflicting stimuli were increased. One-month post-psilocybin, negative affective and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli returned to baseline levels while positive affect remained elevated, and trait anxiety was reduced. Finally, the number of significant resting-state functional connections across the brain increased from baseline to 1-week and 1-month post-psilocybin. These preliminary findings suggest that psilocybin may increase emotional and brain plasticity, and the reported findings support the hypothesis that negative affect may be a therapeutic target for psilocybin.","[Barrett, Frederick S.; Doss, Manoj K.; Sepeda, Nathan D.; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Pekar, James J.] Kennedy Krieger Inst, FM Kirby Res Ctr Funct Brain Imaging, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Pekar, James J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Russell H Morgan Dept Radiol & Radiol Sci, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA","Barrett, FS (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",fbarrett@jhmi.edu,"Barrett, Frederick/V-3730-2019","Barrett, Frederick/0000-0001-7443-3237","National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R03DA042336, T32007209]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RO1DA03889, P41EB015909]; Heffter Research Institute; Steven and Alexandra Cohen Foundation","This work was primarily supported by a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) grant R03DA042336 (PI: Barrett).

This open-label study of the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin was performed to describe the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of psilocybin in sequential, escalating oral doses of 0.3, 0.45, and 0.6 mg/kg in 12 healthy adults. Eligible healthy adults received 6-8 h of preparatory counseling in anticipation of the first dose of psilocybin. The escalating oral psilocybin doses were administered at approximately monthly intervals in a controlled setting and subjects were monitored for 24 h. Blood and urine samples were collected over 24 h and assayed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for psilocybin and psilocin, the active metabolite. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were determined using both compartmental (NONMEM) and noncompartmental (WinNonlin) methods. No psilocybin was found in plasma or urine, and renal clearance of intact psilocin accounted for less than 2% of the total clearance. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were linear within the twofold range of doses, and the elimination half-life of psilocin was 3 h (standard deviation 1.1). An extended elimination phase in some subjects suggests hydrolysis of the psilocin glucuronide metabolite. Variation in psilocin clearance was not predicted by body weight, and no serious adverse events occurred in the subjects studied. The small amount of psilocin renally excreted suggests that no dose reduction is needed for subjects with mild-moderate renal impairment. Simulation of fixed doses using the pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that an oral dose of 25 mg should approximate the drug exposure of a 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of psilocybin. Although doses of 0.6 mg/kg are in excess of likely therapeutic doses, no serious physical or psychological events occurred during or within 30 days of any dose.","[Brown, Randall T.; Nicholas, Christopher R.; Thomas, Chantelle D.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Family Med, Madison, WI USA; [Cozzi, Nicholas V.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Cell & Regenerat Biol, Madison, WI USA; [Gassman, Michele C.; Cooper, Karen M.; Henriquez, Kelsey M.; Ribaudo, Alexandra S.; Hutson, Paul R.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Pharm, 777 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Muller, Daniel] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Med, Madison, WI USA; [Hetzel, Scott J.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Biostatist & Med Informat, Madison, WI USA","Hutson, PR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Pharm, 777 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",paul.hutson@wisc.edu,"Cozzi, Nicholas/AAT-1633-2020",,Psilocybin Research Fund at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Foundation; Usona Research Institute,"This study was funded by gifts from the Psilocybin Research Fund at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Foundation, and by the Usona Research Institute.",,37,38,39,1,44,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",0312-5963,1179-1926,,CLIN PHARMACOKINET,Clin.

Little is known about the neuronal correlates of altered states of consciousness induced by this substance. Limited previous studies indicated profound changes in functional connectivity of resting state networks after the administration of LSD. The current investigation attempts to replicate and extend those findings in an independent sample. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, 100 mu g LSD and placebo were orally administered to 20 healthy participants. Resting state brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Within-network and between-network connectivity measures of ten established resting state networks were compared between drug conditions. Complementary analysis were conducted using resting state networks as sources in seed-to-voxel analyses. Acute LSD administration significantly decreased functional connectivity within visual, sensorimotor and auditory networks and the default mode network. While between-network connectivity was widely increased and all investigated networks were affected to some extent, seed-to-voxel analyses consistently indicated increased connectivity between networks and subcortical (thalamus, striatum) and cortical (precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex) hub structures. These latter observations are consistent with findings on the importance of hubs in psychopathological states, especially in psychosis, and could underlay therapeutic effects of hallucinogens as proposed by a recent model.","[Mueller, Felix; Schmidt, Andre; Borgwardt, Stefan] Univ Basel, Dept Psychiat UPK, Wilhelm Klein Str 27, CH-4012 Basel, Switzerland; [Dolder, Patrick C.; Liechti, Matthias E.] Univ Basel, Dept Biomed, Div Clin Pharmacol & Toxicol, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Dolder, Patrick C.; Liechti, Matthias E.] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Clin Res, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland","Borgwardt, S (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Dept Psychiat UPK, Wilhelm Klein Str 27, CH-4012 Basel, Switzerland.",stefan.borgwardt@upkbs.ch,"Borgwardt, Stefan/Q-6168-2018; Schmidt, Andre/C-2948-2014","Borgwardt, Stefan/0000-0002-5792-3987; Schmidt, Andre/0000-0001-6055-8397; Muller, Felix/0000-0002-4582-6610",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [320030_170249],This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant number 320030_170249 to MEL and SB).,,60,37,37,4,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2213-1582,,,NEUROIMAGE-CLIN,NeuroImage-Clin.,,2018,18,,10.1016/j.nicl.2018.03.005,,,Neuroimaging,Neurosciences & Neurology,GH1NG,WOS:000433169000072,29560311,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2021-12-21,

To better evaluate this topic, we performed a systematic literature review using the PubMed database to find quantitative studies (using statistical analysis) that assessed the effects of ayahuasca or its components in drug-related symptoms or disorders. We found five animal studies (using harmaline, harmine, or ayahuasca) and five observational studies of regular ayahuasca consumers. All animal studies showed improvement of biochemical or behavioral parameters related to drug-induced disorders. Of the five human studies, four reported significant reductions of dependence symptoms or substance use, while one did not report significant results. The mechanisms responsible for the anti-addictive properties of ayahuasca and its alkaloids are not clarified, apparently involving both peripheral MAO-A inhibition by the -carbolines and central agonism of DMT at 5-HT2A receptors expressed in brain regions related to the regulation of mood and emotions. Although results are promising, controlled studies are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.","[Nunes, Amanda A.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biosci, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [dos Santos, Rafael G.; Osorio, Flavia L.; Sanches, Rafael F.; Crippa, Jose Alexandre S.; Hallak, Jaime E.

Salvinorin A, isolated from the plant Salvia divinorum, and its semi-synthetic analogues have been shown to have potent KOP receptor agonist activity and may induce a unique response with similar anticocaine addiction effects as the classic KOP receptor agonists, but with a different side effect profile. Experimental ApproachWe evaluated the duration of effects of Mesyl Sal Bin vivo utilizing antinociception assays and screened for cocaine-prime induced cocaine-seeking behaviour in self-administering rats to predict anti-addiction effects. Cellular transporter uptake assays and in vitro voltammetry were used to assess modulation of dopamine transporter (DAT) function and to investigate transporter trafficking and kinase signalling pathways modulated by KOP receptor agonists. Key ResultsMesyl Sal B had a longer duration of action than SalA, had anti-addiction properties and increased DAT function in vitro in a KOP receptor-dependent and Pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. These effects on DAT function required ERK1/2 activation. We identified differences between Mesyl Sal B and SalA, with Mesyl Sal B increasing the V-max of dopamine uptake without altering cell-surface expression of DAT. Conclusions and ImplicationsSalA analogues, such as Mesyl Sal B, have potential for development as anticocaine agents. Further tests are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which the novel salvinorin-based neoclerodane diterpene KOP receptor ligands produce both anti-addiction and adverse side effects.

After a hiatus of about 50 years, state-of-the art studies have recently begun to close important knowledge gaps by elucidating the mechanisms of action of psychedelics with regard to their effects on receptor subsystems, systems-level brain activity and connectivity, and cognitive and emotional processing. In addition, functional studies have shown that changes in self-experience, emotional processing and social cognition may contribute to the potential therapeutic effects of psychedelics. These discoveries provide a scientific road map for the investigation and application of psychedelic substances in psychiatry. A resurgence in interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs has boosted research into their neurobiological and cognitive effects.

Paradoxically, it is not clear how a neuronal dynamical system running in the fixed human anatomical connectome can give rise to the rich changes in the functional repertoire associated with human brain function, which is impossible to explain through long-term plasticity. Neuromodulation evolved to allow for such flexibility by dynamically updating the effectivity of the fixed anatomical connectivity. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework modeling the dynamical mutual coupling between the neuronal and neurotransmitter systems. We demonstrate that this framework is crucial to advance our understanding of whole-brain dynamics by bidirectional coupling of the two systems through combining multimodal neuroimaging data (diffusion magnetic resonance imaging [dMRI], functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], and positron electron tomography [PET]) to explain the functional effects of specific serotoninergic receptor (5-HT2AR) stimulation with psilocybin in healthy humans. This advance provides an understanding of why psilocybin is showing considerable promise as a therapeutic intervention for neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and addiction. Overall, these insights demonstrate that the whole-brain mutual coupling between the neuronal and the neurotransmission systems is essential for understanding the remarkable flexibility of human brain function despite having to rely on fixed anatomical connectivity.","[Kringelbach, Morten L.; Cabral, Joana] Univ Oxford, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England; [Kringelbach, Morten L.; Cabral, Joana] Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Med, Ctr Mus Brain, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Kringelbach, Morten L.; Cabral, Joana] Univ Minho, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst, Sch Med, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Kringelbach, Morten L.; Cabral, Joana; Whybrow, Peter C.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Eudaimonia & Human Flourishing, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Cruzat, Josephine; Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Computat Neurosci Grp, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Cruzat, Josephine; Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Knudsen, Gitte Moos] Rigshosp, Neurobiol Res Unit, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Knudsen, Gitte Moos] Rigshosp, Ctr Integrated Mol Brain Imaging, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Knudsen, Gitte Moos] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Carhart-Harris, Robin] Imperial Coll London, Dept Brain Sci, Ctr Psychedel Res, London W12 0NN, England; [Whybrow, Peter C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Logothetis, Nikos K.] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Logothetis, Nikos K.] Univ Manchester, Imaging Sci & Biomed Engn, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Deco, Gustavo] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Deco, Gustavo] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neuropsychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Deco, Gustavo] Monash Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Kringelbach, ML (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England.; Kringelbach, ML (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Med, Ctr Mus Brain, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.; Kringelbach, ML (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst, Sch Med, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.; Kringelbach, ML (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Eudaimonia & Human Flourishing, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.; Deco, G (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Computat Neurosci Grp, Barcelona 08018, Spain.; Deco, G (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona 08018, Spain.; Logothetis, NK (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.; Logothetis, NK (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Imaging Sci & Biomed Engn, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.; Deco, G (corresponding author), Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona 08010, Spain.; Deco, G (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neuropsychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.; Deco, G (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",morten.kringelbach@psych.ox.ac.uk; nklmpg@stanford.edu; gustavo.deco@upf.edu,"Cruzat, Josephine/AAX-4082-2020; Knudsen, Gitte Moos/C-1368-2013; Kringelbach, Morten/AAW-5847-2021; Cabral, Joana/T-5118-2018; Deco, Gustavo/A-6341-2008","Cruzat, Josephine/0000-0002-3252-8657; Knudsen, Gitte Moos/0000-0003-1508-6866; Kringelbach, Morten/0000-0002-3908-6898; Cabral, Joana/0000-0002-6715-0826; Deco, Gustavo/0000-0002-8995-7583","Spanish Research Project (Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, European Union) [PSI2016-75688-P]; European UnionEuropean Commission [720270, 785907]; Catalan Agencia de Gestion de Ayudas Universitarias Programme [2017 SGR 1545]; European Research Council Consolidator Grant CAREGIVING [615539]; Center for Music in the Brain - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF117]; Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing - Pettit Foundation; Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [CEECIND/03325/2017]","G.D. is supported by the Spanish Research Project PSI2016-75688-P (Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, European Union); by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreements 720270 (Human Brain Project [HBP] SGA1) and 785907 (HBP SGA2); and by the Catalan Agencia de Gestion de Ayudas Universitarias Programme 2017 SGR 1545.

The recent success of these agonists, also known as psychedelics, like psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and addiction, has ushered in a renaissance in the way these compounds are perceived in the medical community and populace at large. One emerging therapeutic area that holds significant promise is their use as anti-inflammatory agents. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors produces potent anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of human inflammatory disorders at sub-behavioural levels. This review discusses the role of the 5-HT2A receptor in the inflammatory response, as well as highlight studies using the 5-HT2A agonist (R)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine [(R)-DOI] to treat inflammation in cellular and animal models. It also examines potential mechanisms by which 5-HT2A agonists produce their therapeutic effects.

Aims To characterise the time course of regional brain activity leading to auditory verbal hallucinations. Method During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 11 patients with schizophrenia or schizoa fective disorder signalled auditory verbal hallucination events by pressing a button. To control for effects of motor behaviour, regional activity associated with hall cination events was scaled against corresponding activity arising from random button-presses produced by 10 patients who did not experience hallucinations. Results Immediately prior to the hallucinations, motor-adjusted activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus was significantly greater than corresponding activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, motor-adjusted activity in a right posterior temporal region overshadowed corresponding activity in the left homologous temporal region. Robustly elevated motor-adjusted activity in the left temporal region associated with auditory verbal hallucinations was also detected, but only subsequent to hallucination events. At the earliest time shift studied, the correlation between left inferior frontal gyrus and right temporal activity was significantly higher for the hallucination group compared with non-hallucinating patients. Conclusions Findings suggest that heightened functional coupling between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right temporal regions leads to coactivation in these speech processing regions that is hallucinogenic. Delayed left temporal activation may reflect impaired corollary discharge contributing to source misattribution of resulting verbal images.","[Hoffman, Ralph E.; Pittman, Brian; Bhagwagar, Zubin] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Constable, R.

Pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are used to manage these conditions, but their efficacy is limited. Recent interest into the use of psychedelic-assisted therapy using ayahuasca, psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may be a promising alternative for patients unresponsive to traditional treatments. This review aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of psychedelics in the management of resistant depression. Methods: Clinical trials investigating psychedelics in patients with depression and/or anxiety were searched via MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO. Efficacy was assessed by measuring symptom improvement from baseline, and tolerability was evaluated by noting the incidence and type of adverse effects reported. Risk of bias was assessed. Results: Seven studies, with 130 patients, were analysed in this review. Three were conducted in patients with depression, two in patients with anxiety and two in patients with both. In a supportive setting, ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD consistently produced immediate and significant anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects that were endured for several months. Psychedelics were well-tolerated. The most common adverse effects were transient anxiety, short-lived headaches, nausea and mild increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Limitations: At present, the number of studies on this subject is very limited; and the number of participating patients within these is also limited as the treatment under investigations is a relatively novel concept. Conclusions: Though further evidence is required, psychedelics appear to be effective in significantly reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety and are well-tolerated.","[Muttoni, Silvia; Ardissino, Maddalena; John, Christopher] Imperial Coll London, Sch Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Ardissino, Maddalena] Chelsea & Westminster Hosp, Magill Dept Anaesthesia Intens Care & Pain Manage, London SW10 9NH, England","Ardissino, M (corresponding author), Chelsea & Westminster Hosp, Magill Dept Anaesthesia Intens Care & Pain Manage, London SW10 9NH, England.",ma5713@ic.ac.uk,,,,,,127,34,35,16,181,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-0327,1573-2517,,J AFFECT DISORDERS,J.

In this context, we use tools and concepts from the theory of complex networks to analyze resting state fMRI data of the brains of human subjects under two distinct conditions: (i) under ordinary waking state and (ii) in an altered state of consciousness induced by ingestion of Ayahuasca. We report an increase in the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution of the networks subsequent to Ayahuasca ingestion. We also find increased local and decreased global network integration. Our results are broadly consistent with the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of descriptions of mind-expansion frequently seen in self-reports of users of psychedelic drugs.","[Viol, A.; Viswanathan, G.

Neuroscientific study of such 'ego dissolution' experiences offers a window onto the nature of self-awareness. We argue that ego dissolution is best explained by an account that explains self-awareness as resulting from the integrated functioning of hierarchical predictive models which posit the existence of a stable and unchanging entity to which representations are bound. Combining recent work on the 'integrative self' and the phenomenon of selfbinding with predictive processing principles yields an explanation of ego dissolution according to which selfrepresentation is a useful Cartesian fiction: an ultimately false representation of a simple and enduring substance to which attributes are bound which serves to integrate and unify cognitive processing across levels and domains. The self-model is not a mere narrative posit, as some have suggested; it has a more robust and ubiquitous cognitive function than that. But this does not mean, as others have claimed, that the self-model has the right attributes to qualify as a self. It performs some of the right kinds of functions, but it is not the right kind of entity. Ego dissolution experiences reveal that the self-model plays an important binding function in cognitive processing, but the self does not exist.","[Letheby, Chris; Gerrans, Philip] Univ Adelaide, Dept Philosophy, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Letheby, C (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Philosophy, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",cerletheby@gmail.com,,"Letheby, Chris/0000-0002-6293-7873; Gerrans, Philip/0000-0002-1755-8727",Australian Research Council - Australian GovernmentAustralian Research Council [FT 110101050]; Australian Postgraduate Award - Australian GovernmentAustralian Government,"At the time that this research was conducted, Prof. Gerrans was the recipient of an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (project number FT 110101050) funded by the Australian Government, while Dr. Letheby was the recipient of an Australian Postgraduate Award, also funded by the Australian Government.",,65,34,34,2,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2328-8957,,,OPEN FORUM INFECT DI,Open Forum Infect.

Psychedelics are also theorized to produce increases in psychological flexibility, which could explain decreases in depression and anxiety following a psychedelic experience. Therefore, the present cross-sectional survey study sought to examine whether psychological flexibility mediated the relationship between acute psychedelic experiences and spontaneous or intended changes in depression and anxiety among a large international sample of people who reported having used a psychedelic (n = 985; male = 71.6%; Caucasian/white = 84.1%; M-age = 32.2, SD = 12.6). A regression analysis showed that acute effects (i.e., mystical and insightful effects) were significantly associated with decreases in depression/anxiety following a psychedelic experience. A path analysis revealed that, while controlling for age and sex, increases in psychological flexibility fully mediated the effect of mystical and insightful experiences on decreases in depression and anxiety following a psychedelic experience. This suggests that psychological flexibility may be an important mediator of the therapeutic effects of psychedelic drugs. Future prospective experimental studies should examine the effect of psychedelic drug administration on psychological flexibility in order to gain a better understanding of the psychological processes that predict therapeutic effects of psychedelics.","[Davis, Alan K.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Social Work, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Davis, Alan K.; Barrett, Frederick S.; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA","Davis, AK (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, 1947 Coll Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",davis.5996@osu.edu,"Barrett, Frederick/V-3730-2019; Davis, Alan/ABA-1813-2021","Barrett, Frederick/0000-0001-7443-3237; ","NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [T32 DA007209, R01 DA003889] Funding Source: Medline",,,63,33,33,7,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-1447,2212-1455,,J CONTEXT BEHAV SCI,J.

Anecdotal reports have suggested that serotonergic psychedelics administered in low doses on a chronic, intermittent schedule, so-called microdosing, might produce beneficial effects on mood, anxiety, cognition, and social interaction. Here, we test this hypothesis by subjecting male and female Sprague Dawley rats to behavioral testing following the chronic, intermittent administration of low doses of the psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The behavioral and cellular effects of this dosing regimen were distinct from those induced following a single high dose of the drug. We found that chronic, intermittent, low doses of DMT produced an antidepressant- like phenotype and enhanced fear extinction learning without impacting working memory or social interaction. Additionally, male rats treated with DMT on this schedule gained a significant amount of body weight during the course of the study. Taken together, our results suggest that psychedelic microdosing may alleviate symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders, though the potential hazards of this practice warrant further investigation.","[Cameron, Lindsay P.] Univ Calif Davis, Neurosci Grad Program, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Benson, Charlie J.; Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [DeFelice, Brian C.; Fiehn, Oliver] Univ Calif Davis, West Coast Metabol Ctr, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Fiehn, Oliver] King Abdulaziz Univ, Biochem Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, 2700 Stockton Blvd,Suite 2102, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA","Olson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Olson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, 2700 Stockton Blvd,Suite 2102, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.; Olson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA.",deolson@ucdavis.edu,,"DeFelice, Brian/0000-0001-8243-0300; Olson, David/0000-0002-4517-0543; Fiehn, Oliver/0000-0002-6261-8928","UC Davis Department of Chemistry; UC Davis Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Medicine; UC Davis Genome Center; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5T32MH082174-09, U24DK097154, R01DK104351]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1650042]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [U54HD079125] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by funds from the UC Davis Department of Chemistry and Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Medicine as well as a UC Davis Genome Center Pilot Grant (D.E.O.), NIH Grant 5T32MH082174-09 (L.P.C.), NIH Grant U24DK097154 (O.F.), NIH Grant R01DK104351 (B.C.D), and National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship #1650042 (C.J.B.).",,68,32,32,6,27,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7193,,,ACS CHEM NEUROSCI,ACS Chem.

Recent evidence from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) supports the rapid antidepressant effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca in treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of ayahuasca on plasma cortisol and awakening salivary cortisol response, in the same group of treatment-resistant patients (MD) and in healthy volunteers (C). Subjects received a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo (dosing session), and both plasma and awakening salivary cortisol response were measured at baseline (before dosing session) and 48 h after the dosing session. Baseline assessment (D0) showed blunted awakening salivary cortisol response and hypocortisolemia in patients, with respect to healthy controls. Salivary cortisol was also measured during dosing session, and we observed higher increases for both C and MD that ingested ayahuasca than placebo. After 48 h from the dosing session with ayahuasca, patients' awakening salivary cortisol response is similar to the ones detected in controls. No significant changes in plasma cortisol levels were observed 48 h after the sessions. Therefore, these findings point to new evidence on the modulation of salivary cortisol levels as a result of an ayahuasca session, both in healthy and depressive volunteers. Considering that cortisol acts in regulation of distinct physiological pathways, emotional and cognitive processes, it is assumed to be critically involved to the etiology of depression and its regulation seems to be important for the treatment and remission of major depression, ayahuasca use as antidepressant should be further investigated. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of psychedelics in the treatment of human mental disorders.","[de Menezes Galvao, Ana C.; de Almeida, Raissa N.; dos Santos Silva, Erick A.; Galvao-Coelho, Nicole L.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Physiol, Lab Hormone Measurement, Natal, RN, Brazil; [de Menezes Galvao, Ana C.; de Almeida, Raissa N.; Freire, Fulvio A.

This retrospective cross-sectional anonymous online survey characterized 358 individuals (52 females) who reported having quit or reduced smoking after ingesting a psychedelic in a non-laboratory setting >= 1 year ago. On average, participants smoked 14 cigarettes/day for 8 years, and had five previous quit attempts before their psychedelic experience. Of the 358 participants, 38% reported continuous smoking cessation after psychedelic use (quitters). Among quitters, 74% reported >2 years' abstinence. Of the 358 participants, 28% reported a persisting reduction in smoking (reducers), from a mode of 300 cigarettes/month before, to a mode of 1 cigarette/month after the experience. Among reducers, 62% reported >2 years of reduced smoking. Finally, 34% of the 358 participants (relapsers) reported a temporary smoking reduction before returning to baseline smoking levels, with a mode time range to relapse of 3-6 months. Relapsers rated their psychedelic experience significantly lower in personal meaning and spiritual significance than both other groups. Participants across all groups reported less severe affective withdrawal symptoms (e.g. depression, craving) after psychedelic use compared with previous quit attempts, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for psychedelic-associated smoking cessation/reduction. Changes in life priorities/values were endorsed as the most important psychological factor associated with smoking cessation/reduction. Results suggest psychedelics may hold promise in treating tobacco addiction as potentially mediated by spiritual experience, changed priorities/values, and improved emotional regulation.","[Johnson, Matthew W.; Garcia-Romeu, Albert; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Johnson, Patrick S.] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Psychol, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA","Johnson, MW (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",mwj@jhu.edu,"Johnson, Matthew/AAA-3299-2020","Garcia-Romeu, Albert/0000-0003-2182-1644","Beckley Foundation; Heffter Research Institute; National Institute on Drug Abuse Grant [T32DA07209]; NIDA Grant [R01DA003889]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA003889, T32DA007209] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Beckley Foundation provided initial funding for this research, with continued funding provided by Heffter Research Institute.

Given that the 5-HT1A/2A agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), when repeatedly applied, selectively downregulates 5-HT2A, but not 5-HT1A receptors, one might expect LSD to similarly re-balance the postsynaptic 5-HT signalling. Challenging this idea, we use an animal model of depression specifically responding to repeated antidepressant treatment (olfactory bulbectomy), and test the antidepressant-like properties of repeated LSD treatment (0.13 mg/kg/d, 11 d). In line with former findings, we observe that bulbectomised rats show marked deficits in active avoidance learning. These deficits, similarly as we earlier noted with imipramine, are largely reversed by repeated LSD administration. Additionally, bulbectomised rats exhibit distinct anomalies of monoamine receptor signalling in hippocampus and/or frontal cortex; from these, only the hippocampal decrease in 5-HT2 related [S-35]-GTP-gamma-S binding is normalised by LSD. Importantly, the sham-operated rats do not profit from LSD, and exhibit reduced hippocampal 5-HT2 signalling. As behavioural deficits after bulbectomy respond to agents classified as antidepressants only, we conclude that the effect of LSD in this model can be considered antidepressant-like, and discuss it in terms of a re-balance of hippocampal 5-HT2/5-HT1A signalling.","[Buchborn, Tobias; Schroeder, Helmut; Hoellt, Volker; Grecksch, Gisela] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany","Buchborn, T (corresponding author), Otto Von Guericke Univ, Fac Med, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, Leipziger Str 44, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.",tobias.buchborn@med.ovgu.de,,"Buchborn, Tobias/0000-0003-0538-5184",,,,77,32,32,1,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0269-8811,1461-7285,,J PSYCHOPHARMACOL,J.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether psilocybin, recently shown to rapidly improve mood in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), alters patients' emotional processing biases. Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant depression completed a dynamic emotional face recognition task at baseline and 1 month later after two doses of psilocybin with psychological support. Sixteen controls completed the emotional recognition task over the same time frame but did not receive psilocybin. We found evidence for a group x time interaction on speed of emotion recognition (p = .035). At baseline, patients were slower at recognising facial emotions compared with controls (p < .001). After psilocybin, this difference was remediated (p = .208). Emotion recognition was faster at follow-up compared with baseline in patients (p = .004, d = .876) but not controls (p = .263, d = .302). In patients, this change was significantly correlated with a reduction in anhedonia over the same time period (r = .640, p = .010).

Controversies, ethical concerns, and legal implications",BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,English,Article,Addiction; Autonomy; Consequentialism; Ethical relativism; Fidelity; Ketamine; Nonmaleficience; Off-label; Rapid antidepressant,D-ASPARTATE ANTAGONIST; RESISTANT; DEPRESSION; CHALLENGES; INFUSION; TRENDS; MOOD,"Background: Depressive disorders are a common form of psychiatric illness and cause significant disability. Regulation authorities, the medical profession and the public require high safety standards for antidepressants to protect vulnerable psychiatric patients. Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic and a derivative of a hallucinogen (phencyclidine). Its abuse is a major worldwide public health problem. Ketamine is a scheduled drug and its usage is restricted due to its abuse liability. Recent clinical trials have reported that ketamine use led to rapid antidepressant effects in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. However, various flaws in study designs, and possible biased reporting of results, may have influenced those findings. Further analyses of ketamine use are needed to ensure patient safety. Discussion: The use of ketamine in research and treatment of depressive disorders is controversial. Recently, mental health professionals raised ethical concerns about an ongoing ketamine trial in the UK. Also, a Canadian agency reviewed the existing evidence and did not recommend prescribing ketamine to treat depressive disorders. Findings obtained from tightly controlled research settings cannot be easily translated to clinical practice as substance abuse is commonly comorbid with depressive disorders. An effective antidepressant should reduce severity of depressive symptoms without liability problems. Although the US FDA has not approved the use of ketamine to treat depressive disorders, some psychiatrists offer off-label repeat prescription of ketamine. Prescribing ketamine for treating depressive disorders requires substantial empirical evidence. Clinicians should also consider research findings on ketamine abuse. Depressive disorders can be chronic conditions and the current evidence does not rule out the risk of substance abuse after repeat prescription of ketamine. Off-label ketamine use in treating depressive disorders may breach ethical and moral standards, especially in countries seriously affected by ketamine abuse. This article presents two real-world clinical vignettes which highlight ethical principles and theories, including autonomy, nonmaleficience, fidelity and consequentialism, as related to off-label ketamine use. Conclusion: We urge clinicians to minimise the risk of harming patients by considering the empirical evidence on ketamine properties and attempting all standard antidepressant therapies before considering the off-label use of ketamine.","[Zhang, Melvyn W.] Inst Mental Hlth, Natl Addict Management Serv, Singapore 539747, Singapore; [Harris, Keith M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Ho, Roger C.] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Psychol Med, Singapore 117595, Singapore","Zhang, MW (corresponding author), Inst Mental Hlth, Natl Addict Management Serv, 10 Buangkok Green Med Pk, Singapore 539747, Singapore.",melvynzhangweibin@gmail.com,"Ho, Roger C./ABD-9061-2021; Ho, Roger/ABD-8859-2021; Harris, Keith/K-9957-2013","Ho, Roger C./0000-0001-9629-4493; Harris, Keith/0000-0002-1199-2856",,,,44,31,33,0,22,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1472-6939,,,BMC MED ETHICS,BMC Med.

The present investigation aims to compare impulsivity, measured by different rating tools, in patients with anxiety disorders vs. healthy controls. Forty-seven subjects with different anxiety disorders and 45 matched controls underwent diagnostic and symptomatological evaluations by the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) Plus 5.0, Bech-Raphaelsen Depression and Mania Scale (BRDMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hypomania Check List (HCL-32) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI); temperamental evaluations by the Questionnaire for the Affective and Anxious Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Modified (TEMPS-M), the Separation Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SASI), the Interpersonal Sensitivity Symptoms Inventory (ISSI); and psychometric and a neurocognitive evaluations of impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and the Immediate and Delayed Memory Task (IMT-DMT). Subjects with anxiety disorders were more impulsive than the controls in all the explored measures, with higher scores in symptomatological and, temperamental scales. Patients with anxiety disorders but without a lifetime history of comorbid major mood episodes had greater trait and state impulsivity than controls. Further investigations are needed to assess the extent to which impulsivity might or might not be directly related to the anxiety disorder. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, in common for each model is the inadequate response to at least 2 trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of existing literature regarding the challenges and management of TRD has been compiled. A PubMed search was performed to assemble meta-analyses, trials and reviews on the topic of TRD. First, we address the confounds in the definitions and staging models of TRD, and subsequently the difficulties inherent in assessing the illness. Pharmacological augmentation strategies including lithium, triiodothyronine and second-generation antipsychotics are reviewed, as is switching of antidepressant class. Somatic therapies, including several modalities of brain stimulation (electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and deep brain stimulation) are detailed, psychotherapeutic strategies and subsequently novel therapeutics including ketamine, psilocybin, anti-inflammatories and new directions are reviewed in this manuscript.

The legal status of ibogaine in New Zealand provides a unique opportunity to evaluate durability of treatment outcomes. Objective: To examine longitudinal treatment effects over a 12-month period among individuals receiving legal ibogaine treatment for opioid dependence. Method: This observational study measured addiction severity as the primary outcome in 14 participants (50% female) over 12 months post-treatment using the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-Lite) following a single ibogaine treatment by either of two treatment providers. Secondary effects on depression were assessed via the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) was collected before and immediately after treatment to measure opioid withdrawal symptoms. Results: Nonparametric comparisons via Friedman Test between baseline and 12-month follow-up for participants completing all interviews (n = 8) showed a significant reduction for the ASI-Lite drug use (p = 0.002) composite score. Reductions in BDI-II scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up were also significant (p < 0.001). Significant reductions in SOWS scores for all participants (n = 14) were also observed acutely after treatment (p = 0.015). Patients with partial data (n = 4) also showed reductions in ASI-Lite drug use scores and family/social status problems. One patient enrolled in the study died during treatment.Conclusion: A single ibogaine treatment reduced opioid withdrawal symptoms and achieved opioid cessation or sustained reduced use in dependent individuals as measured over 12 months.

This is emphasized by studies showing a reduction in these skills in populations where social interaction and subjective well-being are significantly compromised (e.g., depression). Anecdotal reports and recent studies suggest that a single administration of psilocybin can enhance such processes and could therefore be a potential treatment. However, it has yet to be assessed whether effects outlast acute intoxication. The present study aimed to assess the sub-acute effects of psilocybin on creative thinking, empathy, and well-being. Participants attending a psilocybin retreat completed tests of creative (convergent and divergent) thinking and empathy, and the satisfaction with life scale on three occasions: before ingesting psilocybin (N = 55), the morning after (N = 50), and seven days after (N = 22). Results indicated that psilocybin enhanced divergent thinking and emotional empathy the morning after use. Enhancements in convergent thinking, valence-specific emotional empathy, and well-being persisted seven days after use. Sub-acute changes in empathy correlated with changes in well-being. The study demonstrates that a single administration of psilocybin in a social setting may be associated with sub-acute enhancement of creative thinking, empathy, and subjective well-being. Future research should test whether these effects contribute to the therapeutic effects in clinical populations.","[Mason, Natasha L.; Uthaug, Malin, V; Kuypers, Kim P.

In 1993, the United States National Institutes of Health issued a mandate that funded research must include participants of color and proposals must include methods for achieving diverse samples. Methods: A methodological search of psychedelic studies from 1993 to 2017 was conducted to evaluate ethnoracial differences in inclusion and effective methods of recruiting peopple of color. Results: Of the 18 studies that met full criteria (n = 282 participants), 82.3% of the participants were non-Hispanic White, 2.5% were African-American, 2.1% were of Latino origin, 1.8% were of Asian origin, 4.6% were of indigenous origin, 4.6% were of mixed race, 1.8% identified their race as other, and the ethnicity of 8.2% of participants was unknown. There were no significant differences in recruitment methodologies between those studies that had higher (> 20%) rates of inclusion. Conclusions: As minorities are greatly underrepresented in psychedelic medicine studies, reported treatment outcomes may not generalize to all ethnic and cultural groups. Inclusion of minorities in futures studies and improved recruitment strategies are necessary to better understand the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy in people of color and provide all with equal opportunities for involvement in this potentially promising treatment paradigm.","[Michaels, Timothy I.; Purdon, Jennifer; Collins, Alexis; Williams, Monnica T.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol Sci, Bousfield Psychol Bldg,406 Babbidge Rd,Unit 1020, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Purdon, Jennifer; Williams, Monnica T.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychiat, Hlth Ctr, 263 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT 06030 USA","Michaels, TI (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol Sci, Bousfield Psychol Bldg,406 Babbidge Rd,Unit 1020, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",timothy.michaels@uconn.edu,"Williams, Monnica/O-8209-2017","Williams, Monnica/0000-0003-0095-3277; Michaels, Timothy/0000-0002-3048-6860",,,,86,29,29,2,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-244X,,,BMC PSYCHIATRY,BMC Psychiatry,JUL 31,2018,18,,10.1186/s12888-018-1824-6,,,Psychiatry,Psychiatry,GP0MX,WOS:000440505400001,30064392,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-12-21,

Synthetic, toad, and plant-sourced 5-MeO-DMT are used for spiritual and recreational purposes and may have psychotherapeutic effects. However, the use of 5-MeO-DMT is not well understood. Therefore, we examined patterns of use, motivations for consumption, subjective effects, and potential benefits and consequences associated with 5-MeO-DMT use. Methods: Using internet-based advertisements, 515 respondents (M-age=35.4. SD=11.7; male=79%; White/Caucasian=86%; United States resident=42%) completed a web-based survey. Results: Most respondents consumed 5-MeO-DMT infrequently (<= once/year), for spiritual exploration, and had used less than four times in their lifetime. The majority (average of 90%) reported moderate-to-strong mystical-type experiences (M-intensity=3.64, SD=1.11; range 0-5; e.g., ineffability, timelessness, awe/amazement, experience of pure being/awareness), and relatively fewer (average of 37%) experienced very slight challenging experiences (M-intensity=0.95, SD=0.91; range 0-5; e.g., anxiousness, fear). Less than half (39%) reported repeated consumption during the same session, and very few reported drug craving/desire (8%), or legal (1%), medical (1%), or psychiatric (1%) problems related to use. Furthermore, of those who reported being diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, the majority reported improvements in symptoms following 5-MeO-DMT use, including improvements related to post-traumatic stress disorder (79%), depression (77%), anxiety (69%), and alcoholism (66%) or drug use disorder (60%). Conclusion: Findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT is used infrequently, predominantly for spiritual exploration, has low potential for addiction, and might have psychotherapeutic effects. Future research should examine the safety and pharmacokinetics of 5-MeO-DMT administration in humans using rigorous experimental designs.","[Davis, Alan K.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Behav Pharmacol Res Unit, Baltimore, MD USA; [Barsuglia, Joseph P.; Renn, Elise] Crossroads Treatment Ctr, Rosarito, Mexico; [Lancelotta, Rafael] Univ Wyoming, Sch Counseling Leadership Advocacy & Design, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Grant, Robert M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA USA","Davis, AK (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",alan.kooi.davis@gmail.com,"Davis, Alan/ABA-1813-2021","Barsuglia, Joseph/0000-0001-7337-9486; Lancelotta, Rafael/0000-0002-7789-3463",NIAAAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [AA007747]; NIDAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [DA07209]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI118575]; Source Research Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI118575] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [T32AA007477] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [T32DA007209] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dr Davis was initially supported by a NIAAA T32 training grant (#AA007747) and subsequently by a NIDA T32 training grant (#DA07209).

Building upon previous research, which suggested the potential role of psychedelic meaning-enhancement in enhancing placebo response, the paper explores the mechanisms by which the meaning-amplifying properties of psychedelics might also play a role in enhancing creativity, as well as in effecting mystical-type experiences.

In rodents, classical antidepressants reverse the symptoms of depression by stimulating neuronal proliferation. It has been shown that Ayahuasca presents antidepressant effects in patients with depressive disorder. In the present study, we investigated the effects of harmine in cell cultures containing human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs, 97% nestin-positive) derived from pluripotent stem cells. After 4 days of treatment, the pool of proliferating hNPCs increased by 71.5%. Harmine has been reported as a potent inhibitor of the dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK1A), which regulates cell proliferation and brain development. We tested the effect of analogs of harmine, an inhibitor of DYRK1A (INDY), and an irreversible selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) but not DYRK1A (pargyline). INDY but not pargyline induced proliferation of hNPCs similarly to harmine, suggesting that inhibition of DYRK1A is a possible mechanism to explain harmine effects upon the proliferation of hNPCs. Our findings show that harmine enhances proliferation of hNPCs and suggest that inhibition of DYRK1A may explain its effects upon proliferation in vitro and antidepressant effects in vivo.","[Dakic, Vanja; Macier, Renata de Moraes; Drummond, Hannah; Nascimento, Juliana M.; Trindade, Pablo; Rehen, Stevens K.] DOr Inst Res & Educ, IDOR, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Dakic, Vanja; Drummond, Hannah; Rehen, Stevens K.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biomed Sci, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Nascimento, Juliana M.] Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Dept Biochem & Tissue Biol, Inst Biol, Campinas, SP, Brazil","Rehen, SK (corresponding author), DOr Inst Res & Educ, IDOR, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Rehen, SK (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biomed Sci, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",srehen@lance-ufrj.org,"Nascimento, Juliana M/B-8764-2009; Rehen, Stevens K/J-5874-2012; Trindade, Pablo/D-8913-2016; de Moraes Maciel, Renata/E-1426-2014","Nascimento, Juliana M/0000-0003-3126-4984; Rehen, Stevens K/0000-0003-4216-9501; Trindade, Pablo/0000-0001-5953-7054; ",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Foundation for Research Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Funding Authority for Studies and Projects (FINEP)Financiadora de Inovacao e Pesquisa (Finep); Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES); Sao Paulo Research FoundationFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/21035-0],"This study was funded by the following Brazilian funding agencies: National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Foundation for Research Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Funding Authority for Studies and Projects (FINEP), Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and Sao Paulo Research Foundation (grant 2014/21035-0).

However, little is known on how N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism with ketamine as a novel antidepressant drug target might modulate amygdala reactivity to emotional stimulation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), we assessed amygdalo-hippocampal reactivity at baseline and during pharmacological stimulation with ketamine (intravenous bolus of 0.12 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h) in 23 healthy subjects that were presented with stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). We found that ketamine reduced neural reactivity in the bilateral amygdalo-hippocampal complex during emotional stimulation. Reduced amygdala reactivity to negative pictures was correlated to resting-state connectivity to the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, subjects experienced intensity of psychedelic alterations of consciousness during ketamine infusion predicted the reduction in neural responsivity to negative but not to positive or neutral stimuli. Our findings suggest that the pharmacological modulation of glutamate-responsive cerebral circuits, which is associated with a shift in emotional bias and a reduction of amygdalo-hippocampal reactivity to emotional stimuli, represents an early biomechanism to restore parts of the disrupted neurobehavioral homeostasis in MDD patients.

Preparation is key for maximising the potential of a beneficial psychedelic experience and integration is important for prolonging improvements. The psychological flexibility model (PFM) appears to be a promising one to guide psychedelic preparation and integration. This paper proposes a model that utilises the PFM as informed by a previously published qualitative study of patient accounts of change processes in psilocybin therapy that identified themes of acceptance and connection as associated with positive outcomes. This new model, the ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody) model presents the six psychological flexibility processes, renamed and rearranged in an acceptance triad (defusion, present moment focus, willingness) and a connection triad (self as context, values, committed action). This paper describes the ACE model and how it is being used in an ongoing trial of psilocybin treatment for major depression. It also describes qualitative evidence supportive of the idea that psychological flexibility may be key to characterizing the processes of change involved in psilocybin assisted therapy for depression. These and other results suggest that psilocybin may be specifically increasing psychological flexibility and point to the possibility that psychotherapy approaches incorporating the PFM may serve as a means to deepen and extend the benefits of psilocybin treatment, thus bridging the experiential gap between a potent inner experience and an outer life better lived.","[Watts, Rosalind] Imperial Coll London, Psychedel Res Grp, London, England; [Luoma, Jason B.] Portland Psychotherapy Clin Res & Training Ctr, Portland, OR USA","Watts, R (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Psychedel Res, Dept Brain Sci, London, England.",rosalind.watts@imperial.ac.uk,,,Alex Mosley Foundation,This paper was supported by a grant from the Alex Mosley Foundation.,,31,28,28,2,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-1447,2212-1455,,J CONTEXT BEHAV SCI,J.

Inhalation of vapor from toad secretion containing 5-MeO-DMT has become popular in naturalistic settings as a treatment of mental health problems or as a means for spiritual exploration. However, knowledge of the effects of 5-MeO-DMT in humans is limited. Aims The first objective of this study was to assess sub-acute and long-term effects of inhaling vapor from dried toad secretion containing 5-MeO-DMT on affect and cognition. The second objective was to assess whether any changes were associated with the psychedelic experience. Methods Assessments at baseline, within 24 h and 4 weeks following intake, were made in 42 individuals who inhaled vapor from dried toad secretion at several European locations. Results Relative to baseline, ratings of satisfaction with life and convergent thinking significantly increased right after intake and were maintained at follow-up 4 weeks later. Ratings of mindfulness also increased over time and reached statistical significance at 4 weeks. Ratings of depression, anxiety, and stress decreased after the session, and reached significance at 4 weeks. Participants that experienced high levels of ego dissolution or oceanic boundlessness during the session displayed higher ratings of satisfaction with life and lower ratings of depression and stress. Conclusion A single inhalation of vapor from dried toad secretion containing 5-MeO-DMT produces sub-acute and long-term changes in affect and cognition in volunteers. These results warrant exploratory research into therapeutic applications of 5-MeO-DMT.","[Uthaug, M. V.; Kuypers, K. P. C.; Mason, N.; Riba, J.; Ramaekers, J.

Thus, research into alternative compounds to treat these disorders is essential to guarantee a patient's remission. The last decade has witnessed a revamped interest for the application of psychedelic medicine for the treatment of mental disorders due to anecdotal reports and clinical studies which show that low doses of D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin may have antidepressant effects. LSD and psilocybin have demonstrated mood-modulating properties likely due to their capacity to modulate serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA) and glutamatergic systems. LSD, belonging to the category of classic halluginogens, interacts with the 5-HT system through 5HT1A, and 5HT2A receptors, with the DA system through D2 receptors, and indirectly also the glutamatergic neurotransmission thought the recruitment of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Randomized clinical studies have confirmed its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in humans. Thus, in this chapter, we will review the pharmacology of psychedelic drugs, report the most striking clinical evidence which substantiate the therapeutic potentials of these fascinating compounds in mood disorders, and look into the horizon of where psychedelic medicine is heading.","[De Gregorio, Danilo; Enns, Justine P.; Nunez, Nicolas A.; Posa, Luca; Gobbi, Gabriella] McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Neurobiol Psychiat Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [De Gregorio, Danilo; Enns, Justine P.; Nunez, Nicolas A.; Posa, Luca; Gobbi, Gabriella] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Gobbi, G (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Neurobiol Psychiat Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Gobbi, G (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",gabriella.gobbi@mcgill.ca,,"Gobbi, Gabriella/0000-0003-4124-9825; Enns, Justine/0000-0001-6510-4060; Posa, Luca/0000-0002-6464-1961; DE GREGORIO, DANILO/0000-0002-8623-0661",,,,148,28,29,3,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0079-6123,,978-0-12-814255-4,PROG BRAIN RES,Prog.

Preclinical studies suggest that harmine may have neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects, and retrospective/observational investigations of the mental health of long-term ayahuasca users suggest that prolonged use of this harminerich hallucinogen is associated with better neuropsychological functioning. Thus, in order to better investigate these possibilities, we performed a systematic literature review of preclinical studies analyzing the effects of harmine on hippocampal neurons and in memory-related behavioral tasks in animal models. We found two studies involving hippocampal cell cultures and nine studies using animal models. Harmine administration was associated with neuroprotective effects such as reduced excitotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Harmine also improved memory/learning in several animal models. These effects seem be mediated by monoamine oxidase or acetylcholinesterase inhibition, upregulation of glutamate transporters, decreases in reactive oxygen species, increases in neurotrophic factors, and anti-inflammatory effects. The neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects of harmine should be further investigated in both preclinical and human studies.","[dos Santos, Rafael G.; Hallak, Jaime E.

Over the past several years, ketamine has come into psychiatric use as an intervention for treatment resistant depression (TRD), administered intravenously without a psychotherapeutic component. In these settings, ketamine's psychedelic effects are viewed as undesirable side effects. In contrast, we believe ketamine can benefit patients with a wide variety of diagnoses when administered with psychotherapy and using its psychedelic properties without need for intravenous (IV) access. Its proven safety over decades of use makes it ideal for office and supervised at-home use. The unique experience that ketamine facilitates with its biological, experiential, and psychological impacts has been tailored to optimize office-based treatment evolving into a method that we call Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP). This article is the first to explore KAP within an analytical framework examining three distinct practices that use similar methods. Here, we present demographic and outcome data from 235 patients. Our findings suggest that KAP is an effective method for decreasing depression and anxiety in a private practice setting, especially for older patients and those with severe symptom burden.","[Dore, Jennifer; Dwyer, Shannon] Helios Psychiat, Woodside, CA USA; [Turnipseed, Brent; Turnipseed, Andrea] Roots Behav Hlth, Austin, TX USA; [Andries, Julane; Ascani, German; Monnette, Celeste; Wolfson, Phil] Ctr Transformat Psychotherapy, San Anselmo, CA USA; [Huidekoper, Angela; Strauss, Nicole; Wolfson, Phil] Ketamine Res Fdn, 6 Crest Ave San Anselmo, San Anselmo, CA 94960 USA","Wolfson, P (corresponding author), Ketamine Res Fdn, 6 Crest Ave San Anselmo, San Anselmo, CA 94960 USA.",ketamine.research@gmail.com,,,,,,37,27,27,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0279-1072,2159-9777,,J PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS,J.

It begins with the discovery of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and its promising development as a treatment for several types of mental illnesses during the 1940s. This was followed by its abuse and stigmatization in the 1960s that ultimately led to the placement of LSD and other psychedelic drugs into the most restrictively regulated drug schedule of the United States Controlled Substances Act (Schedule I) in 1970 and its international counterparts. These regulatory controls severely constrained development of psychedelic substances and their potential for clinical research in psychiatric disorders. Despite the limitations, there was continued research into brain mechanisms of action for psychedelic drugs with potential clinical applications which began during the 1990s and early 2000s. Finding pathways to accelerate clinical research in psychedelic drug development is supported by the growing body of research findings that are documented throughout this special issue of Neuropharmacology. Accumulated research to date suggests psychedelic drug assisted psychotherapy may emerge as a potential breakthrough treatment for several types of mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and addiction that are refractory to current evidenced based therapies. This research equally shows promise in advancing the understanding of the brain, brain related functioning, and the consequential effects of untreated brain related diseases that have been implicated in causing and/or exacerbating numerous physical disease state conditions. The authors conclude that more must be done to effectively address mental illnesses and brain related diseases which have become so pervasive, destructive, and whose treatments are becoming increasingly resistant to current evidenced based therapies.

Its potential as a psychiatric medicine has recently been demonstrated and its non-medical use around the world appears to be growing. We aimed to investigate well-being and problematic alcohol use in ayahuasca users, and ayahuasca's subjective effects. An online, self-selecting, global survey examining patterns of drug use was conducted in 2015 and 2016 (n = 96,901). Questions were asked about: use of ayahuasca, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and magic mushrooms; demographics, current well-being and past-year problematic alcohol use of past-year ayahuasca users and comparison drug users; and subjective effects of ayahuasca and comparison drugs. Ayahuasca users (n = 527) reported greater well-being than both classic psychedelic users (n = 18,138) and non-psychedelic drug-using respondents (n = 78,236). Ayahuasca users reported less problematic drinking than classic psychedelic users, although both groups reported greater problematic drinking than the other respondents. Ayahuasca's acute subjective effects usually lasted for six hours and were most strongly felt one hour after consumption. Within our online, self-selecting survey, ayahuasca users reported better well-being than comparison groups and less problematic drinking than classic psychedelic users. Future longitudinal studies of international samples and randomised controlled trials are needed to dissect the effects of ayahuasca on these outcomes.","[Lawn, Will; Porffy, Lilla; Morgan, Celia J.

In light of the immense need for improved and targeted interventions for social impairments, it is important to better understand the neurochemical substrates of social interaction abilities. We therefore investigated the pharmacological and neural correlates of self-and other-initiated social interaction. In a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study 24 healthy human participants (18 males and 6 females) received either (1) placebo + placebo, (2) placebo + lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 100 mu g, p.o.), or (3) ketanserin (40 mg, p.o.) + LSD (100 mu g, p.o.) on three different occasions. Participants took part in an interactive task using eye-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging completing trials of self-and other-initiated joint and non-joint attention. Results demonstrate first, that LSD reduced activity in brain areas important for self-processing, but also social cognition; second, that change in brain activity was linked to subjective experience; and third, that LSD decreased the efficiency of establishing joint attention. Furthermore, LSD-induced effects were blocked by the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonist ketanserin, indicating that effects of LSD are attributable to 5-HT2AR stimulation. The current results demonstrate that activity in areas of the social brain can be modulated via the 5-HT2AR thereby pointing toward this system as a potential target for the treatment of social impairments associated with psychiatric disorders.","[Preller, Katrin H.; Pokorny, Thomas; Flemming, Jan; Vollenweider, Franz X.] Univ Hosp Psychiat Zurich, Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Preller, Katrin H.; Pokorny, Thomas; Flemming, Jan; Seifritz, Erich; Vollenweider, Franz X.] Univ Hosp Psychiat Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schilbach, Leonhard] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Independent Max Planck Res Grp Social Neurosci, D-80804 Munich, Germany; [Schilbach, Leonhard] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Clin Disorders Social Interact, D-80804 Munich, Germany; [Schilbach, Leonhard] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychiat, D-80336 Munich, Germany","Preller, KH (corresponding author), Psychiat Univ Hosp Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",preller@bli.uzh.ch,"Schilbach, Leonhard/G-5832-2010; Preller, Katrin/AAD-8914-2019","Schilbach, Leonhard/0000-0001-5547-8309; ",Heffter Research Institute [1-190413]; Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation [2015-0103]; Usona Institute [2015-2056]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [P2ZHP1_161626],"This study was financially supported by Grants from the Heffter Research Institute (1-190413), the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation (2015-0103), the Usona Institute (2015-2056), and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF; P2ZHP1_161626).

It is suggested that classic psychedelic-occasioned mystical experience is characterized by profound awe, a discrete emotion experienced in the presence of a vast stimulus requiring accommodation of mental structures. Awe, in turn, promotes the small self, a construct that, in the extreme, is analogous to those of unitive experience and ego dissolution. The small self is conceptualized as key to understanding the downstream effects of mystical experience occasioned in the context of classic psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

Increasing evidence indicates that astrocytic pathology contributes to the formation of depression. In this study, we investigated the effects of harmine, a natural beta-carboline alkaloid and potent hallucinogen, known to modulate astrocytic glutamate transporters, on chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depressive-like behaviors and astrocytic dysfunctions. Results showed that harmine treatment (10, 20 mg/kg) protected the mice against the CUS-induced increases in the immobile time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), and also reversed the reduction in sucrose intake in the sucrose preference experiment. Harmine treatment (20 mg/kg) prevented the reductions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels and hippocampal neurogenesis induced by CUS. In addition, harmine treatment (20 mg/kg) increased the protein expression levels of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and prevented the CUS-induced decreases in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) protein expressions in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, suggesting that restoration of astrocytic functions may be a potential mechanism underlying the antidepressant-like effects of harmine. This opinion was proved by the results that administration of mice with L-Alpha-Aminoadipic Acid (L-AAA), a gliotoxin specific for astrocytes, attenuated the antidepressant-like effects of harmine, and prevented the improvement effects of harmine on BDNF protein levels and hippocampal neurogenesis. These results provide further evidence to confirm that astrocytic dysfunction contributes critically to the development of depression and that harmine exerts anti-depressant-like effects likely through restoration of astrocytic functions.","[Liu, Fengguo] Danyang Peoples Hosp, Dept Neurol, 2 Xinmin Western Rd, Danyang 212300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jingjing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Suzhou Kowloon Hosp, Dept Cardiol, 118 Wansheng St, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gong, Yu; Wang, Peng; Tong, Lijuan; Chen, Xiangfan; Ling, Yong; Huang, Chao] Nantong Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, 19 Qixiu Rd, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gong, Yu; Wang, Peng; Tong, Lijuan; Chen, Xiangfan; Ling, Yong; Huang, Chao] Key Lab Inflammat & Mol Drug Target Jiangsu Prov, 19 Qixiu Rd, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lei] First Peoples Hosp Yancheng, Dept Pharm, Yulong Western Rd, Yancheng 224006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Huang, C (corresponding author), Nantong Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, 19 Qixiu Rd, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",huachao@ntu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81571323]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20141240]; Science and Technology Project of Nantong City [MS12015050],"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81571323), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20141240), and the Science and Technology Project of Nantong City (No. MS12015050).",,70,26,27,0,18,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0278-5846,1878-4216,,PROG NEURO-PSYCHOPH,Prog.

Controlling for the severity of TBI, it was hypothesized that participants in Group 1 would perform more poorly than those in Group 2 on measures of executive functioning. Design: The primary outcome variable was decision making as assessed by performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Secondary outcome variables included laboratory-measured impulsivity as measured by the Immediate and Delayed Memory Test (IMT/DMT), abstract reasoning as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and aggression as measured by the Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA) scale. Results: Among those in Group 1, time between TBI and first suicide attempt postinjury varied widely (months to nearly 30 years). Only the WCST perseverative errors score differed significantly between individuals with and without histories of one or more suicide attempts (SAs). Conclusion: Suggestions for future study of SA among those with TBI are provided. When working with individuals with TBI, clinicians are encouraged to incorporate suicide risk assessment into their practice. Augmenting this process with a measure of perseveration may be beneficial.","[Homaifar, Beeta Y.; Brenner, Lisa A.] VISN 19 MIRECC, Denver, CO 80220 USA; [Homaifar, Beeta Y.; Brenner, Lisa A.; Nagamoto, Herbert] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Denver, CO 80210 USA; [Brenner, Lisa A.] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Denver, CO USA; [Brenner, Lisa A.] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Dept Phys Med, Denver, CO USA; [Brenner, Lisa A.] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Dept Rehabil, Denver, CO USA; [Forster, Jeri E.] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Denver, CO USA; [Nagamoto, Herbert] Eastern Colorado Hlth Care Syst, Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Denver, CO USA","Homaifar, BY (corresponding author), VISN 19 MIRECC, 1055 Clermont St, Denver, CO 80220 USA.",beeta.homaifar@va.gov,"Brenner, Lisa A./AAG-2442-2019",,,,,29,26,26,0,15,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0090-5550,,,REHABIL PSYCHOL,Rehabil.

Enduring changes in personality/attitudes, depression, spirituality, anxiety, wellbeing, substance misuse, meditative practices, and mindfulness were documented. Mystical experiences, connectedness, emotional breakthrough, and increased neural entropy were related to these long-term changes in psychological functioning. Finally, with proper screening, preparation, supervision, and integration, limited aversive side effects were noted by study participants.

Over 18 months, more than a thousand individuals from 59 countries did a daily evaluation of negative and positive emotional state using the PANAS checklist plus written reports for between one week and four months. Participant reports suggested that spaced but repeated microdoses were followed by improvements in negative moods, especially depression, and increases in positive moods. Increased energy, improved work effectiveness, and improved health habits were observed in clinical and non-clinical populations.

We propose that the subjective effects of psychedelics are necessary for their enduring beneficial effects and that these subjective effects account for the majority of their benefit.","[Yaden, David B.; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Yaden, David B.; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA","Griffiths, RR (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.; Griffiths, RR (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Psychedel & Consciousness Res, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.; Griffiths, RR (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",rgriff@jhmi.edu,,"Yaden, David/0000-0002-9604-6227",,,,28,24,24,2,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,2575-9108,,ACS PHARMACOL TRANSL,ACS Pharmacol.

However, no modern studies have evaluated subjective and autonomic effects of different and pharmaceutically well-defined doses of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 16 healthy subjects (eight women, eight men) who underwent six 25 h sessions and received placebo, LSD (25, 50, 100, and 200 mu g), and 200 mu g LSD 1 h after administration of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg). Test days were separated by at least 10 days. Outcome measures included self-rating scales that evaluated subjective effects, autonomic effects, adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 24 h. The pharmacokinetic-subjective response relationship was evaluated. LSD showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination and dose-dependently induced subjective responses starting at the 25 mu g dose. A ceiling effect was observed for good drug effects at 100 mu g. The 200 mu g dose of LSD induced greater ego dissolution than the 100 mu g dose and induced significant anxiety. The average duration of subjective effects increased from 6.7 to 11 h with increasing doses of 25-200 mu g. LSD moderately increased blood pressure and heart rate. Ketanserin effectively prevented the response to 200 mu g LSD. The LSD dose-response curve showed a ceiling effect for subjective good effects, and ego dissolution and anxiety increased further at a dose above 100 mu g. These results may assist with dose finding for future LSD research. The full psychedelic effects of LSD are primarily mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation.","[Holze, Friederike; Vizeli, Patrick; Ley, Laura; Dolder, Patrick; Stocker, Melanie; Duthaler, Urs; Liechti, Matthias E.] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Biomed, Basel, Switzerland; [Holze, Friederike; Vizeli, Patrick; Ley, Laura; Dolder, Patrick; Stocker, Melanie; Duthaler, Urs; Liechti, Matthias E.] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Clin Res Clin Pharmacol & Toxicol, Basel, Switzerland; [Holze, Friederike; Vizeli, Patrick; Ley, Laura; Dolder, Patrick; Stocker, Melanie; Duthaler, Urs; Liechti, Matthias E.] Univ Basel, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Basel, Switzerland; [Mueller, Felix; Varghese, Nimmy; Eckert, Anne; Borgwardt, Stefan] Univ Basel, Psychiat Univ Hosp, Basel, Switzerland; [Varghese, Nimmy; Eckert, Anne] Univ Basel, Transfac Res Platform Mol & Cognit Neurosci, Basel, Switzerland","Liechti, ME (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Biomed, Basel, Switzerland.; Liechti, ME (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Clin Res Clin Pharmacol & Toxicol, Basel, Switzerland.; Liechti, ME (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Basel, Switzerland.",matthias.liechti@usb.ch,"Duthaler, Urs/P-4498-2017","Duthaler, Urs/0000-0002-7811-3932; Eckert, Anne/0000-0002-9341-3669; Vizeli, Patrick/0000-0002-5954-4446; Holze, Friederike/0000-0003-3143-1519",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [32003B_185111]; Universitat Basel (Universitatsbibliothek Basel),"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no. 32003B_185111 to MEL).

Recent findings This brief opinion piece offers a perspective on how psychedelics work in the brain that may help contextualize these developments. It attempts to link various scales of action, from the molecular (serotonin 2A receptor agonism) through to the anatomical and functional (heightened plasticity) and up to the dynamic (increased brain entropy), systems level (network disintegration and desegregation) and experiential. Summary It is proposed that psychedelics initiate a cascade of neurobiological changes that manifest at multiple scales and ultimately culminate in the relaxation of high-level beliefs. The purpose of psychedelic therapy is to harness the opportunity afforded by this belief-relaxation to achieve a healthy revision of pathological beliefs.","[Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Univ Oxford, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Psychedel Res, Oxford, England; [Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Psychiat, Psychedel Res Grp, London, England","Carhart-Harris, RL (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Psychiat, Psychedel Res Grp, London, England.",r.carhart-harris@imperial.ac.uk,,,Alex Mosley Charitable Trust; Ad Astra Chandaria Foundation,The author is supported by the Alex Mosley Charitable Trust and the Ad Astra Chandaria Foundation.,,75,24,24,9,50,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0951-7367,1473-6578,,CURR OPIN PSYCHIATR,Curr.

While depression is associated with additional abnormalities besides reduced mood, such as cognitive dysfunction, it is not well established that sensory perception is also altered in this disorder (aside from in psychotic depression). Recent studies have shown that visual processing, in as early a stage as the retina, is impaired in depression. This paper examines the hypothesis that major depression can involve alterations in sensory perception. Methods: A Pubmed literature search investigated several lines of evidence: innervation of sensory cortex by serotonin and norepinephrine; antidepressant drugs and depression itself affecting processing of facial expressions of emotion; electroencephalography (EEG) studies of depressed persons and antidepressant drugs; involvement of the serotonergic 5HT2A receptor in both depression and hallucinogenic drug action; psychotic depression involving sensory distortions; dopamine possibly playing a role in depression; and the antidepressant effect of blocking the NMDA receptor with ketamine. Results: Data from each of these lines of evidence support the hypothesis that major depression can involve sensory perceptual alterations. Conclusions: Loss of interest in one's daily activities and inability to experience pleasure, also known as anhedonia, in major depression may in part be mediated by sensory abnormalities, whereby normal sensory perceptions are no longer present to activate reward circuitry. Limitations: The data supporting the hypothesis tend to be associative, so further confirmation of the hypothesis awaits additional controlled experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recent trials with single/few doses of these compounds show that they induce rapid and sustained antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects. These effects are also observed in religious groups using the DMT-containing brew ayahuasca. The agonist action of these substances on 5-HT2A receptors expressed in frontal and limbic areas increase glutamatergic transmission and neuroplasticity. These neurochemical effects are associated with acute alterations on self-perception and increases in introspection and positive mood, and with subacute and long-term decreases in psychiatric symptoms, increases in some personality traits such as openness, improvements in emotional processing, and increases in empathy. These are preliminary but promising results that should be further explored in controlled trials with larger sample sizes, especially considering that these compounds could be beneficial in the treatment of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders.","[dos Santos, Rafael Guimaraes; Cecilio Hallak, Jaime Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Neurosci & Behav, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [dos Santos, Rafael Guimaraes; Cecilio Hallak, Jaime Eduardo] CNPq, Natl Inst Translat Med INCT TM, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil","dos Santos, RG (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med Ribeirao Preto, Dept Neurociencias & Ciencias Comportamento, Hosp Clin, Av Bandeirantes 3900, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",banisteria@gmail.com,"dos Santos, Rafael Guimaraes/F-7124-2010","dos Santos, Rafael Guimaraes/0000-0003-2388-4745",CNPq (Brazil)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),RGS is Fellow of the Brazilian National Post-Doctorate Program (PNPD/CAPES).

However, there is inconsistency across studies investigating the effect of ketamine for chronic pain management. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis in order to assess the efficacy of this compound during chronic non-cancer pain conditions. MethodsThe study consisted in a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing ketamine to a placebo during chronic non-cancer pain. The primary endpoint of this study was pain relief 4weeks after the beginning of treatment. Secondary outcomes were: pain relief 1, 2, 8 and 12weeks after the beginning of treatment and incidence of psychedelic manifestations. ResultsSix studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, 99 patients received ketamine and 96 received placebo. Ketamine did not decrease pain intensity at 4weeks (MD (on a 0 to 10 scale)=-1.12 [-2.33, 0.09], GRADE evidence: very low). However, analysing studies with no high-risk bias found ketamine to decrease pain intensity at 4weeks and increased the level of GRADE evidence to moderate. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the overall result and revealed the lack of power of this meta-analysis. Ketamine also decreased pain intensity at all other evaluated points in time. Ketamine increased the incidence of psychedelic manifestations in comparison to placebo. ConclusionResults of this meta-analysis found moderate evidence suggesting the efficacy of ketamine during chronic pain. Further studies are warranted to conclude about the effect of ketamine during chronic pain conditions and to determine optimal administration regimes of this agent during this condition. SignificanceKetamine has been found interesting for managing chronic pain. We performed a meta-analysis aiming to confirm those results. Ketamine was found efficient in alleviating pain up to 12weeks after the beginning of treatment. However, overall evidence favouring the use of this compound was very low.","[Michelet, D.; Horlin, A-L; Bellon, M.; Julien-Marsollier, F.; Vacher, T.; Dahmani, S.] Robert Debre Univ Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia & Intens Care, Paris, France; [Michelet, D.; Horlin, A-L; Bellon, M.; Julien-Marsollier, F.; Vacher, T.; Pontone, S.; Dahmani, S.] Paris Diderot Univ, Paris, France; [Brasher, C.] Royal Childrens Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia & Pain Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pontone, S.] Robert Debre Univ Hosp, Dept Palliat Care & Pain Management, Paris, France; [Dahmani, S.] Robert Debre Univ Hosp, DHU PROTECT, INSERM, U1141, Paris, France","Dahmani, S (corresponding author), Robert Debre Univ Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia & Intens Care, Paris, France.; Dahmani, S (corresponding author), Paris Diderot Univ, Paris, France.; Dahmani, S (corresponding author), Robert Debre Univ Hosp, DHU PROTECT, INSERM, U1141, Paris, France.",souhayl.dahmani@rdb.aphp.fr,"Brasher, Christopher/Y-4488-2019; Pontone, Stefano/H-7681-2019","Brasher, Christopher/0000-0003-1037-3604; Pontone, Stefano/0000-0001-7148-3220; dahmani, Souhayl/0000-0002-1577-1030",,,,61,23,23,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-3801,1532-2149,,EUR J PAIN,Eur.

Hyperconnectivity in the default mode network has been associated with psychopathology, but psychedelic serotonin agonists like psilocybin may profoundly disrupt these dysfunctional neural network circuits and provide a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders. We have reviewed the current literature to investigate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. There were seven clinical trials that investigated psilocybin-assisted therapy as a treatment for psychiatric disorders related to anxiety, depression, and substance use. All trials demonstrated reductions in psychiatric rating scale scores or increased response and remission rates. There were large effect sizes related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. Psilocybin may also potentially reduce alcohol or tobacco use and increase abstinence rates in addiction, but the benefits of these two trials were less clear due to open-label study designs without statistical analysis. Psilocybin-assisted therapy efficacy and safety appear promising, but more robust clinical trials will be required to support FDA approval and identify the potential role in clinical psychiatry.","[Thomas, Kelan] Touro Univ Calif, Clin Sci, 1310 Club Dr,Adm & Fac 2, Vallejo, CA 94592 USA; [Malcolm, Benjamin] Western Univ Hlth Sci, Pharm Practice & Adm, Pomona, CA USA; [Lastra, Dan] Touro Univ Calif, Vallejo, CA USA","Thomas, K (corresponding author), Touro Univ Calif, Clin Sci, 1310 Club Dr,Adm & Fac 2, Vallejo, CA 94592 USA.",kelan.thomas@tu.edu,"Thomas, Kelan/AAZ-8575-2021","Thomas, Kelan/0000-0003-2818-270X",,,,33,23,23,6,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0279-1072,2159-9777,,J PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS,J.

Results Nearly half (46%; n=355) of participants reported prior suicidality and were thus excluded from the present analyses. Of 290 women eligible at baseline, 11% (n=31) reported recent suicidality during follow-up, with an incidence density of 4.42 per 100 person-years (95% CI 3.10 to 6.30). In multivariable analysis, reported lifetime psychedelic drug use was associated with a 60% reduced hazard for suicidality (adjusted HR (AHR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.94). Crystal methamphetamine use (AHR 3.25; 95% CI 1.47 to 7.21) and childhood abuse (AHR 3.54; 95% CI 1.49 to 8.40) remained independent predictors of suicidality. Conclusion The high rate of suicidality identified in this study is of major concern. Alongside emerging evidence on the potential of psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat some mental illness and addiction issues, our findings demonstrate that naturalistic psychedelic drug use is independently associated with reduced suicidality, while other illicit drug use and childhood trauma predispose women to suicidality. While observational, this study supports calls for further investigation of the therapeutic utility of psychedelic drugs in treating poor mental health and promoting mental wellness.","[Argento, Elena; Braschel, Melissa; Shannon, Kate] St Pauls Hosp, Gender & Sexual Hlth Initiat, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Argento, Elena] Univ British Columbia, Interdisciplinary Studies Grad Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Strathdee, Steffanie A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tupper, Kenneth; Wood, Evan; Shannon, Kate] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Tupper, Kenneth; Wood, Evan] St Pauls Hosp, BC Ctr Substance Use, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Shannon, K (corresponding author), St Pauls Hosp, Gender & Sexual Hlth Initiat, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Shannon, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",gshi@cfenet.ubc.ca,"Strathdee, Steffanie A/B-9042-2009","Strathdee, Steffanie/0000-0002-7724-691X","US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01DA028648]; MacAIDS; Canada Research Chair in Global Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS; Michael Smith Foundation for Health ResearchMichael Smith Foundation for Health Research; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Doctoral AwardCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); NIDA merit award [R37DA019829]; Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Inner-City Medicine award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R37DA019829, R01DA028648] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was supported by the US National Institutes of Health (R01DA028648) and MacAIDS.

Previous findings demonstrate that mGlu2 mRNA expression is down-regulated in brain cortical regions of 5-HT2A knockout (KO) mice. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this alteration remains unknown. We show here repressive epigenetic changes at the promoter region of the mGlu2 gene in frontal cortex of 5-HT2A-KO mice. Disruption of 5-HT2A receptor-dependent signaling in mice was associated with decreased acetylation of histone H3 (H3ac) and H4 (H4ac) and increased tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the mGlu2 promoter, epigenetic changes that correlate with transcriptional repression. Neither methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3) nor tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) was affected. We found that Egr1, a transcription factor in which promoter activity was positively regulated by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist 4-bromo-3,6 dimethoxybenzocyclobuten-1-yl) methylamine hydrobromide, binds less to the mGlu2 promoter in frontal cortex of 5-HT2A-KO, compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, expression of mGlu2 was increased by viral-mediated gene transfer of FLAG-tagged Egr1 in mouse frontal cortex. Together, these observations suggest that 5-HT2A receptor-dependent signaling epigenetically affects mGlu2 transcription in mouse frontal cortex.","[Kurita, Mitsumasa; Moreno, Jose L.; Holloway, Terrell; Kozlenkov, Alexey; Mocci, Giuseppe; Garcia-Bea, Aintzane; Hanks, James B.; Nestler, Eric J.; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Nestler, Eric J.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Nestler, Eric J.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Nestler, Eric J.; Russo, Scott J.; Gonzalez-Maeso, Javier] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Neve, Rachael] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Gonzaalez-Maeso, J (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Psychiat, 1 Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1229, New York, NY 10029 USA.",Javier.Maeso@mssm.edu,"Russo, Scott/R-7107-2019; Moreno, Jose L/L-8981-2017","Russo, Scott/0000-0002-6470-1805; ","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH084894]; Dainippon Sumitomo PharmaDainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.; Maltz Family Foundation; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Basque GovernmentBasque Government; Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH087004, P50MH096890, R56MH084894, R01MH084894, P50MH090963] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health [Grant MH084894]; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma; the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD); the Maltz Family Foundation; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); and the Basque Government.,,52,23,25,1,8,AMER SOC PHARMACOLOGY EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3995 USA",0026-895X,1521-0111,,MOL PHARMACOL,Mol.

Intravenous anesthetic propofol can remarkably inhibit or eliminate ketamine's side effects including cardiovascular system excitement and hallucinogenic activity even in a sub-anesthesia dose. However, effect of propofol on rapid antidepressant-like action induced by ketamine still remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate effect of pretreatment with propofol on the ketamine-induced rapid antidepressant-like action in rats receiving forced swimming test. Open field test and forced swimming test were used to investigate behavior changes of rats receiving different medication. Expression of brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) pGluR1-Ser845 in hippocampus was measured with sandwich-ELISA and Western Blot, respectively. Results demonstrated that rats receiving propofol alone showed neither antidepressant-like effects nor increased BDNF content; pretreatment with propofol could increase the ketamine-induced antidepressant-like effects and the expression of AMPA pGluR1-Ser845 in hippocampus. but could not further reinforce the increased BDNF content induced by ketamine in hippocampus; after AMPA receptor was antagonized, the strengthening effect of propofol on ketamine-induced antidepressant-like action significantly decreased. The results indicated that propofol in a sub-anesthetic dose could increase the ketamine-induced antidepressant-like effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

According to media reports, microdosing has grown in popularity, yet the scientific literature contains minimal research on this practice. There has been limited reporting on adverse events associated with microdosing, and the experiences of microdosers in community samples have not been categorized. Methods: In the present study, we develop a codebook of microdosing benefits and challenges (MDBC) based on the qualitative reports of a real-world sample of 278 microdosers. Results: We describe novel findings, both in terms of beneficial outcomes, such as improved mood (26.6%) and focus (14.8%), and in terms of challenging outcomes, such as physiological discomfort (18.0%) and increased anxiety (6.7%). We also show parallels between benefits and drawbacks and discuss the implications of these results. We probe for substance-dependent differences, finding that psilocybin-only users report the benefits of microdosing were more important than other users report. Conclusions: These mixed-methods results help summarize and frame the experiences reported by an active microdosing community as high-potential avenues for future scientific research. The MDBC taxonomy reported here informs future research, leveraging participant reports to distil the highest-potential intervention targets so research funding can be efficiently allocated. Microdosing research complements the full-dose literature as clinical treatments are developed and neuropharmacological mechanisms are sought. This framework aims to inform researchers and clinicians as experimental microdosing research begins in earnest in the years to come.","[Anderson, Thomas] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Petranker, Rotem] York Univ, Clin Psychol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Christopher, Adam] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rosenbaum, Daniel; Weissman, Cory; Hui, Katrina; Hapke, Emma] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Dinh-Williams, Le-Anh] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Psychol Clin Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada","Anderson, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Mississauga, ON, Canada.; Petranker, R (corresponding author), York Univ, Clin Psychol, Toronto, ON, Canada.",metathomas.anderson@mail.utoronto.ca; rotem@boredomlab.org,"; Anderson, Thomas/I-7687-2014","Weissman, Cory/0000-0002-5087-8263; Hui, Katrina/0000-0002-5472-3779; Rosenbaum, Daniel/0000-0002-4846-9380; Anderson, Thomas/0000-0002-2387-5219",,,,55,22,22,7,23,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1477-7517,,,HARM REDUCT J,Harm Reduct.

In medicine, there are two main methods of improving the health care provided: seeking new treatment procedures and perfecting (optimizing) the existing ones. Optimization of treatment includes not only practical tools such as therapeutic drug monitoring but also implementation of general trends in the clinical practice. New pharmacological options include new more sophisticated forms of monoaminergic drugs, old drugs rediscovered on the base of a better understanding of pathophysiology of mental illnesses, and drugs aimed at new treatment targets. In depression, treatment resistance to antidepressive pharmacotherapy represents one of the most important clinical challenges. Switching to monotherapy with new multimodal/multifunctional antidepressants and augmentation with new atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and brexpiprazole) may be promising options. Further, current evidence supports utility and safety of adjunctive treatment of nutraceuticals. Novel approaches being studied include ketamine and opioids. Recent advances in technology and emerging knowledge about dysfunctional brain circuits and neuroplasticity have led to the development of different new neuromodulation techniques usually used as add-on therapy. Antipsychotics are still the cornerstone of the current treatment of schizophrenia. Two new partial dopamine agonists, brexpiprazole and cariprazine, are now available in addition to aripiprazole. Although the mechanisms of action are similar, the two agents differ in terms of their pharmacodynamic profiles. Further, two new formulations of long-acting injections of second-generation antipsychotics (aripiprazole lauroxil and 3-month paliperidone palmitate) were introduced into clinical practice. New treatment options not yet available include cannabidiol, glutamate modulators, and nicotine receptors agonists.","[Ceskova, Eva; Silhan, Petr] Univ Hosp Ostrava, Dept Psychiat, Ostrava, Czech Republic","Ceskova, E (corresponding author), Fac Hosp Brno, Dept Psychiat, Jihlavska 20, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.",eva.ceskova@gmail.com,"Silhan, Petr/Q-5342-2019","Silhan, Petr/0000-0002-3145-9215",,,,40,22,26,1,18,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",1178-2021,,,NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT,Neuropsychiatr.

Chronic mild stress (CMS) was applied to male and female Long-Evans rats to model anhedonia common in depression. The progressive loss in preference for a sucrose solution over plain water, a measure of anhedonia, and locomotor activity were monitored for 7 weeks. Because antidepressant medications often modify reproductive functions, endocrine glands and hormone-sensitive tissues were assessed at necropsy after the conclusion of the behavioral protocol. Three weeks of CMS exposure led to a decrease in sucrose preference. CMS was continued for 3 additional weeks and animals were randomly assigned to treatment with 1 mg SalvA/kg body weight or to a vehicle control group. The results indicate that SalvA reversed anhedonia whereas control animals continued to show a suppressed preference for the sucrose solution. In addition, no change in sucrose preference was observed in nonstressed rats that were exposed to the same dosage of SalvA. The results indicate that SalvA is an effective antidepressant agent when administered chronically to rats showing symptoms of depression similar to those observed in humans.

Accumulating preclinical evidence emphasizes the role of the glutamate system in the acute action of the drug on brain and behavior; however this has never been tested in humans. Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design, we utilized an ultra-high field multimodal brain imaging approach and demonstrated that psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) induced region-dependent alterations in glutamate, which predicted distortions in the subjective experience of one's self (ego dissolution). Whereas higher levels of medial prefrontal cortical glutamate were associated with negatively experienced ego dissolution, lower levels in hippocampal glutamate were associated with positively experienced ego dissolution. Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic, as well as the baseline, state. Importantly, they may also provide a neurochemical basis for therapeutic effects as witnessed in ongoing clinical trials.","[Mason, N. L.; Kuypers, K. P. C.; Muller, F.; Reckweg, J.; Tse, D. H.

Controlled studies are needed to investigate both the therapeutic potential and the neurobiological underpinnings of this pharmacologic treatment. METHODS: The present study was designed to examine the effects of a single low dose of LSD (13 mu g) versus placebo on resting-state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow in healthy young adults. Twenty men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning sessions in which they received placebo or LSD under double-blind conditions. During each session, the participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, they underwent resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent and arterial spin labeling scans. Cerebral blood flow as well as amygdala and thalamic connectivity were analyzed. RESULTS: LSD increased amygdala seed-based connectivity with the right angular gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and the cerebellum, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the left and right postcentral gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. This low dose of LSD had weak and variable effects on mood, but its effects on positive mood were positively correlated with the increase in amygdala-middle frontal gyrus connectivity strength. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings show that a very low dose of LSD, which produces negligible subjective changes, alters brain connectivity in limbic circuits. Additional studies, especially with repeated dosing, will reveal whether these neural changes are related to the drug's purported antidepressant effect.","[Bershad, Anya K.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Preller, Katrin H.] Univ Hosp Psychiat Zurich, Pharmaconeuroimaging & Cognit Emot Proc, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lee, Royce; Keedy, Sarah; Wren-Jarvis, Jamie; Bremmer, Michael P.; de Wit, Harriet] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, 5841 South Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","de Wit, H (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, 5841 South Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",hdew@uchicago.edu,,"de Wit, Harriet/0000-0002-7211-8994","National Insitutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DA02812]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [2T32GM007281]; Heffter Research Institute; Grossman Institute for Neuroscience, Quantitative Biology and Human Behavior; Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Center at the University of Chicago","HdW was supported by National Insitutes of Health (NIH) Grant No. DA02812, AKB was supported by NIH Grant No. 2T32GM007281, and KHP was supported by the Heffter Research Institute.

Another hallucinogenic drug, esketamine, has recently been U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved as a rapid-acting antidepressant. The mechanistic basis for the antidepressant effects of psilocybin and ketamine appear to be conserved. The efficacy of these two medications has not, however, been directly compared either clinically or preclinically. Further, whether or not a profound subjective existential experience is necessary for psilocybin to have antidepressant effects is unknown. To address these questions, we tested psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and ketamine in a rat model for depression. As in humans, a single administration of psilocybin or LSD produced persistent antidepressant-like effects in our model. In contrast, ketamine produced only a transient antidepressant-like effect. Our results indicate that classic psychedelics may have therapeutic efficacy that is more persistent than that of ketamine, and also suggest that a subjective existential experience may not be necessary for therapeutic effects.","[Hibicke, Meghan; Landry, Alexus N.; Kramer, Hannah M.; Talman, Zoe K.; Nichols, Charles D.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Expt Therapeut, Hlth Sci Ctr, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA","Nichols, CD (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Expt Therapeut, Hlth Sci Ctr, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",Cnich1@lsuhsc.edu,"Nichols, Charles D/F-7153-2012","Nichols, Charles D/0000-0002-0615-0646","Eleusis, PBC","This work was supported by Eleusis, PBC.",,68,21,21,10,25,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7193,,,ACS CHEM NEUROSCI,ACS Chem.

Previously, our group reported that ayahuasca could be a potential analogue of mindfulness practice. The main aim of the current study was to examine the effects of ayahuasca on emotional regulation and mindfulness-related capacities. Secondarily, we sought to explore the effects of ayahuasca on individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits.MethodThis is an observational study of 45 volunteers who participated in an ayahuasca session. The volunteers completed various self-report instruments designed to measure emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)-Short Form and Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)) prior to and 24h after the ayahuasca session. The volunteers were divided into two subgroups based on their score on the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD). Twelve participants were grouped into the BPD-like traits subgroup while the rest of them were included in the non-BPD-like subgroup. We performed within-subjects and between-group analyses.ResultsOverall, the participants showed significant improvements on the FFMQ subscales observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting and also significantly improved on decentering (EQ scale) and on the DERS subscales emotional non-acceptance, emotional interference, and lack of control. The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities.ConclusionsThese findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice). Based on these results, we believe that ayahuasca therapy could be of value in clinical populations, such as individuals with BPD, affected by emotion dysregulation.","[Dominguez-Clave, Elisabet; Soler, Joaquim; Pascual, Juan C.; Elices, Matilde; Franquesa, Alba; Alvarez, Enric; Riba, Jordi] Hosp Santa Creu & St Pau Inst Recerca, Serv Psiquiat, Barcelona, Spain; [Dominguez-Clave, Elisabet; Valle, Marta] UAB, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Barcelona, Spain; [Dominguez-Clave, Elisabet; Soler, Joaquim; Pascual, Juan C.; Elices, Matilde; Valle, Marta; Riba, Jordi] CIBERSAM, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Barcelona, Spain; [Soler, Joaquim; Pascual, Juan C.; Alvarez, Enric] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Psiquiat & Med Legal, Barcelona, Spain; [Valle, Marta] IIB St Pau, St Pau Inst Biomed Res, Pharmacokinet & Pharmacodynam Modelling & Simulat, Barcelona, Spain; [Riba, Jordi] IIB St Pau, St Pau Inst Biomed Res, Human Neuropsychopharmacol Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Riba, Jordi] Masstricht Univ, Dept Neuropsychol & Psychopharmacol, Maastricht, Netherlands","Soler, J; Riba, J (corresponding author), Hosp Santa Creu & St Pau Inst Recerca, Serv Psiquiat, Barcelona, Spain.; Soler, J; Riba, J (corresponding author), CIBERSAM, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Barcelona, Spain.; Soler, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Psiquiat & Med Legal, Barcelona, Spain.; Riba, J (corresponding author), IIB St Pau, St Pau Inst Biomed Res, Human Neuropsychopharmacol Grp, Barcelona, Spain.; Riba, J (corresponding author), Masstricht Univ, Dept Neuropsychol & Psychopharmacol, Maastricht, Netherlands.",jsolerri@santpau.cat; jordi.riba@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Dominguez-Clave, Elisabet/K-6124-2018; Pascual, Juan C./M-2559-2014","Dominguez-Clave, Elisabet/0000-0001-6528-0064; Soler, Joaquim/0000-0001-8077-3641; Pascual, Juan C./0000-0001-8039-9346; Riba, Jordi/0000-0002-9375-8421","FIS grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitivity - Instituto de Salud Carlos III [PI16/00078]; Institut de Recerca de l'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona; PFIS grant","This study was funded by a FIS grant from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitivity - Instituto de Salud Carlos III, under contract PI16/00078 (IP: Enric Alvarez and Jordi Riba), in collaboration with Institut de Recerca de l'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona.

We estimated the prevalence and associated risk factors of psychiatric distress among the college students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Methods: We performed this cross-sectional study, from Jan to May 2016 at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. Students filled out voluntarily an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, personal information, behavioral risk factors, and a validated Persian version of the GHQ-28 questionnaire, including somatic symptoms (items 1-7), anxiety/insomnia (items 8-14), social dysfunctions (items 15-21), and severe depression (items 22-28). Results: Of 1259 participants, 518 (41.1%) had psychiatric distress, 166 (13.2%) had heterosexual intercourse, 100 (8.0%) had homosexual intercourse, 204 (16.2%) were smokers (31.6% in males and 6.3% in females), 124 (9.9%) reported a history of using opium/psychedelic substances, 204 (16.2%) reported suicide thought, and 103 (8.2%) had attempted suicide at least once in the past. After adjusting odds ratio (95% CI) for age and sex, psychiatric distress were significantly associated with emotional breakdown 2.67 (2.09, 3.40), heterosexual intercourse 2.56 (1.82, 3.62), homosexual intercourse 2.42 (1.57, 3.71), smoking 3.19 (2.29, 4.45), substance abuse 5.03 (3.26, 7.76), suicide thought 7.81 (5.42, 11.27), suicide attempt 5.64 (3.49, 9.12), uninterested in the discipline 2.29 (1.70, 3.07), and non-optimistic about future 2.16 (1.63, 2.86).

The receptor mechanisms that drive their molecular and behavioral effects involve activation of cortical serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, but the responses of specific cellular populations remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that a small subset of 5-HT2A-expressing excitatory neurons is directly activated by psychedelics and subsequently recruits other select cell types including subpopulations of inhibitory somatostatin and parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons, as well as astrocytes, to produce distinct and regional responses. To gather data regarding the response of specific neuronal populations, we developed methodology for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to segregate and enrich specific cellular subtypes in the brain. These methods allow for robust neuronal sorting based on cytoplasmic epitopes followed by downstream nucleic acid analysis, expanding the utility of FACS in neuroscience research.

Inhibition of glycolysis by means of an injection with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) reduced the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, p<0.05, in comparison with control, least significant difference (LSD) test), N-acetylaspartate (NAA, p<0.05, LSD test) and choline compounds, and at the same time increased the levels of glutamate and glutamine. An opposite effect was found after injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - a very common pro-inflammatory inducer. An increase in the amounts of GABA, NAA and choline compounds in the brain occurred in mice treated with LPS. Different metabolic responses to the energy deficiency and the pro-inflammatory stimuli can explain the contradictory results of the brain H-1 MRS studies under neurodegenerative pathology, which is accompanied by both mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. The prevalence of the excitatory metabolites such as glutamate and glutamine in 2DG treated mice is in good agreement with excitation observed during temporary reduction of the available energy under acute hypoxia or starvation. In turn, LPS, as an inducer of the sickness behavior, which was manifested as depression, sleepiness, loss of appetite etc., shifts the brain metabolic pattern toward the prevalence of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.

Results: The results of this study suggest that salvia use is most common among young adults aged 18-25 years as well as individuals who had engaged in risk-taking behaviors (selling illicit drugs, stealing) or illicit drug use (especially other hallucinogens/ecstasy). Self-reported depression and anxiety were also associated with salvia use.

The accessibility, legal status, and psychoactive effects of salvia can be a potentially complicating health risk to young people, especially among those with existing substance use problems.","[Perron, Brian E.] Univ Michigan, Sch Social Work, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ahmedani, Brian K.] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Ctr Hlth Policy & Hlth Serv Res, Detroit, MI USA; [Vaughn, Michael G.] St Louis Univ, Dept Publ Policy Studies, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; [Glass, Joseph E.] Washington Univ, George Warren Brown Sch Social Work, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Abdon, Arnelyn] Univ Philippines Diliman, Sch Econ, Quezon City, Philippines; [Wu, Li-Tzy] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Perron, BE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Social Work, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",beperron@umich.edu,"Vaughn, Michael/W-2694-2019; WU, LI-TZY/I-7481-2012","WU, LI-TZY/0000-0002-5909-2259","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH019960] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R03AA019575] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [T32DA015035, R01DA019901, R03DA027832, R01DA019623] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [AA019575, R03 AA019575] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [5T32 DA015035, R03 DA027832, R01 DA019623, R01 DA019901, DA019623, DA019901, DA027832, T32 DA015035] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32 MH019960] Funding Source: Medline",,,20,21,21,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0095-2990,1097-9891,,AM J DRUG ALCOHOL AB,Am.

Further exploration of the potential psychotherapeutic effects of 5-MeO-DMT could inform future clinical trials. Objectives: We examined self-reported improvement in depression and anxiety among people who use 5-MeO-DMT in a group setting with structured procedures guiding dose and administration of 5-MeO-DMT. Such procedures also include activities for the preparation of, and support during/following sessions, which are similar to procedures used in clinical trials of hallucinogen administration. Next, we examined whether depression or anxiety were improved following use, and whether the acute subjective effects (mystical/challenging) or beliefs about the 5-MeO-DMT experience were associated with improvements in these conditions. Methods: Respondents (n = 362; M-age = 47.7; Male = 55%; White/Caucasian = 84%) completed an anonymous web-based survey. Results: Of those reporting having been diagnosed with depression (41%) or anxiety (48%), most reported these conditions were improved (depression = 80%; anxiety = 79%) following 5-MeO-DMT use, and fewer reported they were unchanged (depression = 17%; anxiety = 19%) or worsened (depression = 3%; anxiety = 2%). Improvement in depression/anxiety conditions were associated with greater intensity of mystical experiences and higher ratings of the spiritual significance and personal meaning of the 5-MeO-DMT experience. There were no associations between depression or anxiety improvement and the intensity of acute challenging physical/psychological effects during the 5-MeO-DMT experience. Conclusions: Future prospective controlled clinical pharmacology studies should examine the safety and efficacy of 5-MeO-DMT administration for relieving depression and anxiety.","[Davis, Alan K.; Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Behav Pharmacol Res Unit, Baltimore, MD USA; [So, Sara] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mental Hlth, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Lancelotta, Rafael] Univ Wyoming, Sch Counseling Leadership Advocacy & Design, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Barsuglia, Joseph P.] New Sch Res LLC, North Hollywood, CA USA; [Griffiths, Roland R.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD USA","Davis, AK (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, 5510 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",alan.kooi.davis@gmail.com,"Davis, Alan/ABA-1813-2021","Lancelotta, Rafael/0000-0002-7789-3463; Barsuglia, Joseph/0000-0001-7337-9486; Davis, Alan/0000-0003-4770-8893","NIAAA T32 training grant [AA007747]; NIDA T32 training grant [DA007209]; Source Research Foundation; NIDA grant [R01DA003889]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [T32AA007477] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [T32DA007209, R01DA003889] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","During his work on this study, the first author was initially supported by a NIAAA T32 training grant [#AA007747] and subsequently by a NIDA T32 training grant [#DA007209].

It is believed that newborn neurons in this region encode temporal information about partially overlapping contextual memories. The 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a naturally occurring compound capable of inducing a powerful psychedelic state. Recently, it has been suggested that DMT analogs may be used in the treatment of mood disorders. Due to the strong link between altered neurogenesis and mood disorders, we tested whether 5-MeO-DMT is capable of increasing DG cell proliferation. We show that a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 5-MeO-DMT increases the number of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU+) cells in adult mice DG. Moreover, using a transgenic animal expressing tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase under doublecortin promoter, we found that 5 Meo-DMT treated mice had a higher number of newborn DG Granule cells (GC). We also showed that these DG GC have more complex dendritic morphology after 5-MeO-DMT. Lastly, newborn GC treated with 5-MeO-DMT, display shorter afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potentials and higher action potential (AP) threshold compared. Our findings show that 5-MeO-DMT affects neurogenesis and this effect may contribute to the known antidepressant properties of DMT-derived compounds.","[Lima da Cruz, Rafael Vitor; Petiz, Lyvia Lintzmaier; Leao, Richardson N.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Brain Inst, Neurodynam Lab, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Moulin, Thiago C.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Med Biochem, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Leao, Richardson N.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Neurosci, Dev Genet, Uppsala, Sweden","da Cruz, RVL; Leao, RN (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Brain Inst, Neurodynam Lab, Natal, RN, Brazil.; Leao, RN (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Neurosci, Dev Genet, Uppsala, Sweden.",rafael.lima@neuro.ufrn.br; richardson.leao@neuro.ufrn.br,"Moulin, Thiago C/I-4070-2013; Leao, Richardson/AAX-4985-2020","Moulin, Thiago C/0000-0001-7811-5383; Leao, Richardson/0000-0001-8496-1965; Petiz, Lyvia/0000-0002-4258-2649",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [PROBITEC]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [445345/2014-4],This study was funded by the Brazilian agencies Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES; award no.

Following completion of a small open-label feasibility study, we are currently conducting a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol use disorder. Although treatment effects cannot be analyzed until the study is complete, descriptive case studies provide a useful window into the therapeutic process of psychedelic-assisted treatment of addiction. Here we describe treatment trajectories of three participants in the ongoing trial to illustrate the range of experiences and persisting effects of psilocybin treatment. Although it is difficult to generalize from a few cases, several qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the data presented here. Although participants often find it difficult to describe much of their psilocybin experience, pivotal moments tend to be individualized, extremely vivid, and memorable. Often, the qualitative content extends beyond the clinical problem that is being addressed. The participants discussed in this paper experienced acute and lasting alterations in their perceptions of self, in the quality of their baseline consciousness, and in their relationship with alcohol and drinking. In these cases, experiences of catharsis, forgiveness, self-compassion, and love were at least as salient as classic mystical content. Finally, feelings of increased spaciousness or mindfulness, and increased control over choices and behavior were reported following the drug administration sessions. Ultimately, psilocybin-assisted treatment appears to elicit experiences that are extremely variable, yet seem to meet the particular needs of the individual.","[Bogenschutz, Michael P.; Podrebarac, Samantha K.; Duane, Jessie H.; Amegadzie, Sean S.; Malone, Tara C.; Owens, Lindsey T.; Ross, Stephen; Mennenga, Sarah E.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10003 USA","Bogenschutz, MP (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10003 USA.",michael.bogenschutz@nyumc.org,"Mennenga, Sarah E/N-9236-2016","Mennenga, Sarah E/0000-0002-9279-2409; Bogenschutz, Michael/0000-0003-4530-3470",Heffter Research Institute; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R25DA022461] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Funding for this research was provided by the Heffter Research Institute, as well as individual donations from Carey and Claudia Turnbull, Dr. Efrem Nulman, and Rodrigo Nino.",,18,20,20,2,33,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-9812,,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

Both, short and long sleep durations are associated to worse quality of life and poor health outcomes. Portugal represents a specific population model, since according to European statistics it has high rates of chronic diseases like depression, hypertension, diabetes and stroke; and low quality of life as well as low index of physical activity, while in parallel it has some other good health indicators such as: low age-standardized mortality for both genders, nutrition in terms of energy and fruit consumption, smoking and alcohol, obesity and overweight prevalence. The aim of this study was to characterize health and chronic diseases, lifestyles and quality of life in subjects with short and long sleep duration. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional evaluation of the third wave of follow-up of the EpiDoC Cohort was carried between 2015-2016. A sample of 5,436 adults >= 18 years, representative of the national population, self-reported their daily total sleep time. Associations between short sleep duration (SSD <= 5h), long sleep duration (LSD >= 9h) and independent variables were determined. Results: The prevalence for SSD was high (20.7%) and the LSD (5.9%) was low Being older, with lower education, retired and unemployed were associated to SSD and LSD (p<0.01). Being obese was associated to SSD as well as hypertension, gastrointestinal disease and hypercholesterolemia (p<0.01). SSD and LSD, were associated with diabetes (p<0.01 and p=0.03) and depression (p<0.01 and p=0.02) respectively. Cardiovascular disease (p<0.01) was associated to LSD. Multimorbidity (p<0.01) was associated to SSD. Worse quality of life and bad physical function were associated to SSD and LSD, as well as being hospitalized in the previous 12 months (p<0.01). Conclusions: Socio-demographic, physical activity and chronic diseases were associated to reduction and extension of sleep duration. There was no association between rheumatic diseases and cancer with sleep duration, as found in other studies. This study emphasizes the burden of self-reported SSD for Portugal, its consequences to health and the need to increase sleep awareness campaigns enhancing the importance of sleep in health. Furthermore, it emphasizes that chronic diseases risks are dependent on multiple parameters which varying in different countries or regions, imply the need of regional studies and interventions.","[Reis, Catia] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Saude Ambiental ISAMB, Lisbon, Portugal; [Reis, Catia; Paiva, Teresa] CENC Sleep Med Ctr, Sleep & Circadian Rhythms, Lisbon, Portugal; [Dias, Sara; Rodrigues, Ana Maria; Sousa, Rute Dinis; Gregorio, Maria Joao; Branco, Jaime; Canhao, Helena] Univ Nova Lisboa, NMS, Ctr Estudos Doencas Cron CEDOC, EpiDoC Unit,NOVA Med Sch, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Ana Maria; Branco, Jaime; Canhao, Helena] Soc Portuguesa Reumatol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Ana Maria] Inst Mol Med, Rheumatol Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal; [Dias, Sara; Rodrigues, Ana Maria; Sousa, Rute Dinis; Canhao, Helena] Assoc Cient Evora, EpiSaude, Evora, Portugal; [Dias, Sara] Inst Politecn Leiria, Ctr Innovat Care & Hlth Technol, CiTechCare, Escola Super Saude, Leiria, Portugal; [Gregorio, Maria Joao] Programa Nacl Promocao Alimentacao Saudavel, Direcao Geral Saude, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gregorio, Maria Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias Nutr & Alimentacao, Porto, Portugal; [Branco, Jaime] Hosp Egas Moniz, Serv Reumatol, CHLO, EPE, Lisbon, Portugal","Reis, C (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Saude Ambiental ISAMB, Lisbon, Portugal.; Reis, C (corresponding author), CENC Sleep Med Ctr, Sleep & Circadian Rhythms, Lisbon, Portugal.",reis.catia@gmail.com,"Reis, Catia/ABH-1292-2020; Gregorio, Maria Joao/AAI-2085-2021; Dias, Sara/I-9965-2018; Canhao, Helena/C-9611-2018","Reis, Catia/0000-0001-6585-3993; Gregorio, Maria Joao/0000-0002-0380-7833; Sousa, Rute Dinis de/0000-0001-9713-0204; Dias, Sara/0000-0001-6782-7481; Canhao, Helena/0000-0003-1894-4870; Paiva, Maria Teresa Aguiar dos Santos/0000-0002-7937-7841; Branco, Jaime/0000-0001-7024-4375; Rodrigues, Ana Maria/0000-0003-2046-8017",,,,52,20,20,4,6,BRAZILIAN ASSOC SLEEP,SAO PAULO,"RUA DR DIOGO FARIA, 508, VILA CLEMENTINO, SAO PAULO, SP 04037-001, BRAZIL",1984-0659,1984-0063,,SLEEP SCI,Sleep Sci.,,2018,11,4,10.5935/1984-0063.20180036,,,Clinical Neurology,Neurosciences & Neurology,HJ1WT,WOS:000456956400003,30746039,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-12-21,

N-Ethyl-1,2-diphenylethanamine (ephenidine) is a diary-lethylamine that has recently become popular with recreational users searching for dissociative hallucinogenic effects. In the present study, the pharmacological basis of its neural actions has been investigated, initially by assessing its profile in central nervous system receptor binding assays and subsequently in targeted electrophysiological studies. Ephenidine was a potent inhibitor of H-3-MK-801 binding (Xi: 66 nM), implying that it acts at the PCP site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. It also showed modest activity at dopamine (379 nM) and noradrenaline (841 nM) transporters and at sigma 1 (629 nM) and sigma 2 (722 nM) binding sites. In experiments of extracellular recording of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from area CAl of rat hippocampal slices, ephenidine, 1 and 10 mu M, respectively, produced a 25% and a near maximal inhibition of the NMDA receptor mediated fEPSP after 4 h super fusion. By contrast, ephenidine (50 mu M) did not affect the AMPA receptor mediated fEPSPs. In whole cell patch clamp recordings, from hippocampal pyramidal cells, ephenidine (10 mu M) blocked NMDA receptor mediated EPSCs in a highly voltage-dependent manner. Additionally, ephenidine, 10 mu M, blocked the induction of long term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 induced by theta burst stimulation. The present data show that the new psychoactive substance, ephenidine, is a selective NMDA receptor antagonist with a voltage-dependent profile similar to ketamine. Such properties help explain the dissociative, cognitive and hallucinogenic effects in man. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Ionotropic glutamate receptors'. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Because serotonergic hallucinogens increase glutamate release and mGlu receptors modulate the response to serotonin (5-HT)(2A) activation, the interactions between serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and mGlu receptors may prove to be important for our understanding of these diseases. We tested the effects of the serotonergic hallucinogen and 5-HT2A agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), and the selective 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907, on locomotor activity in the mouse behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) in mGlu5 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice on a C57 background. Both male and female mGlu5 KO mice showed locomotor hyperactivity and diminished locomotor habituation compared with their WT counterparts. Similarly, the mGlu5-negative allosteric modulator 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) also increased locomotor hyperactivity, which was absent in mGlu5 KO mice. The locomotor hyperactivity in mGlu5 receptor KO mice was potentiated by DOM (0.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously (SC)) and attenuated by M100907 (1.0 mg/kg, SC). M100907 (0.1 mg/kg, SC) also blocked the hyperactivity induced by MPEP. These studies demonstrated that loss of mGlu5 receptor activity either pharmacologically or through gene deletion leads to locomotor hyperactivity in mice. Additionally, the gene deletion of mGlu5 receptors increased the behavioral response to the 5-HT2A agonist DOM, suggesting that mGlu5 receptors either mitigate the behavioral effects of 5-HT2A hallucinogens or that mGlu5 KO mice show an increased sensitivity to 5-HT2A agonists. Taken together, these studies indicate a functional interaction between mGlu5 and 5-HT2A receptors.","[Halberstadt, Adam L.; Lehmann-Masten, Virginia D.; Geyer, Mark A.; Powell, Susan B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat 0804, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Powell, SB (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat 0804, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",sbpowell@ucsd.edu,"Halberstadt, Adam L/J-9328-2015",,"National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [DA002925, DA025412]; Veterans Affairs VISN 22 Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical CenterUS Department of Veterans Affairs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA002925, F32DA025412] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse Awards DA002925 and DA025412 and the Veterans Affairs VISN 22 Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center.

This study examined the effects of sustained trazodone administration on 5-HT neurotransmission. Electrophysiological recordings were conducted in anesthetized rats. Subcutaneously implanted minipumps delivered vehicle or trazodone (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 and 14 days. A 2-day trazodone administration suppressed the firing rate of raphe 5-HT neurons, which recovered to baseline after 14 days. This was attributable to 5-HT1A autoreceptor desensitization because the suppressant effect of the 5-HT autoreceptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide was dampened in 14-day trazodone-treated rats. Prolonged trazodone administration did not change the sensitivity of postsynaptic 5-HT1A and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in hippocampus, but enhanced synaptic 5-HT levels because the 5-HT1A antagonist N-{2-[4 (2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl}-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY-100635) enhanced hippocampal firing in treated rats, but not in controls. Trazodone administration for 14 days increased the 50% recovery time value, an index of 5-HT transporter blockade in vivo, and decreased the inhibitory function of terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptors on the electrically evoked release of 5-HT. The agonistic action of trazodone at 5-HT1A receptors was characterized as being full because it did not attenuate the inhibitory action of 5-HT when coapplied locally. The enhanced 5-HT neurotransmission by trazodone is caused in part by reuptake blockade and activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which may account for its effectiveness in major depression.","[Ghanbari, Ramez; El Mansari, Mostafa; Blier, Pierre] Univ Ottawa, Mental Hlth Res Inst, Ottawa, ON K1Z 7K4, Canada; [Blier, Pierre] Univ Ottawa, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ottawa, ON K1Z 7K4, Canada","Ghanbari, R (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Mental Hlth Res Inst, Room 7403,1145 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Z 7K4, Canada.",ramez.ghanbari@rohcg.on.ca,,,Labopharm and the Canadian Institutes for Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [77838]; Canadian Government; University of Ottawa Institute of Mental Health Research; Astra ZenecaAstraZeneca; Biovail; Bristol Myers SquibbBristol-Myers Squibb; Eli LillyEli Lilly; JanssenJohnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc; Labopharm; Lundbeck/TakedaTakeda Pharmaceutical Company LtdLundbeck Corporation; Sepracor; ServierServier; WyethWyeth,"This study was supported by Labopharm and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research [Grant 77838] (to P.

Conventional wisdom holds that peak mystical experiences induced by psychedelics are a critical component of their therapeutic mechanisms of action, though evidence supporting that claim is largely correlational. Here, I present data suggesting that the subjective effects induced by psychedelics may not be necessary to produce long-lasting changes in mood and behavior. Understanding the role of subjective effects in the therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelics will have important implications for both basic neuroscience and for increasing patient access to the next generation of medicines developed as a result of psychedelic research.","[Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, Sch Med, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Olson, David E.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA","Olson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Chem, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Olson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, Sch Med, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.; Olson, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.",deolson@ucdavis.edu,,"Olson, David/0000-0002-4517-0543",National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM128997],"This work was supported by funds from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R01GM128997 to D.E.O.).

LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included. Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567 patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in the future.","[Jose Fuentes, Juan; Fonseca, Francina; Elices, Matilde; Torrens, Marta] Hosp del Mar, Inst Neuropsiquiatria & Addict, Barcelona, Spain; [Fonseca, Francina; Torrens, Marta] Hosp del Mar Med Res Inst IMIM, Neurosci Res Program, Addict Res Grp GRAd, Barcelona, Spain; [Fonseca, Francina; Torrens, Marta] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Psychiat Dept, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Elices, Matilde] CIBERSAM, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Madrid, Spain; [Farr, Magi] Hosp Univ Germans Trias & Pujol IGTP, Clin Pharmacol Dept, Badalona, Spain; [Farr, Magi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Pharmacol Dept, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain","Torrens, M (corresponding author), Hosp del Mar, Inst Neuropsiquiatria & Addict, Barcelona, Spain.; Torrens, M (corresponding author), Hosp del Mar Med Res Inst IMIM, Neurosci Res Program, Addict Res Grp GRAd, Barcelona, Spain.; Torrens, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Psychiat Dept, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain.",mtorrens@parcdesalutmar.cat,,"Fonseca, Francina/0000-0002-0779-6545","Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII, FIS-FEDER) [FIS PI11/01961, FISPI17/01962]; ISCIII-Red de Trastornos Adictivos [RTA RD16/0017/0003, RD16/0017/0010]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [HOME/2014/JDRU/AG/DRUG/7082]; Grups de Recerca AGAUR-Gencat [2017 SGR 316, 2017 SGR 530]; Accio instrumental d'Intensificacio de Professionals de la Salut - Facultatius especialistes [PERIS: SLT006/17/00014]; ISCIIIInstituto de Salud Carlos III [FJCI-2017-31738]","This work was supported in part by grants from Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII, FIS-FEDER, FIS PI11/01961, FISPI17/01962), ISCIII-Red de Trastornos Adictivos (RTA RD16/0017/0003 and RD16/0017/0010) and The European Commission (HOME/2014/JDRU/AG/DRUG/7082, Predicting Risk of Emerging drugs with in silico and Clinical Toxicology (PREDICT)).

To further investigate the effects of psilocybin on emotion processing networks, we studied for the first-time psilocybin's acute effects on amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity in an event-related face discrimination task in 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a double-blind balanced cross-over design. The amygdala has been implicated as a salience detector especially involved in the immediate response to emotional face content. We used beta-series amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity during an emotional face discrimination task to elucidate the connectivity pattern of the amygdala over the entire brain. When we compared psilocybin to placebo, an increase in reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli was found. Psilocybin decreased the connectivity between amygdala and the striatum during angry face discrimination. During happy face discrimination, the connectivity between the amygdala and the frontal pole was decreased. No effect was seen during discrimination of fearful faces. Thus, we show psilocybin's effect as a modulator of major connectivity hubs of the amygdala. Psilocybin decreases the connectivity between important nodes linked to emotion processing like the frontal pole or the striatum. Future studies are needed to clarify whether connectivity changes predict therapeutic effects in psychiatric patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

These drugs continue to be the primary medicines used in major depressive disorder. Although they have biological effects after acute dosing, full antidepressant response generally takes weeks of daily administration. Lack of rapid onset is a large limitation in antidepressant therapy (e.g., suicide, lack of medication compliance, difficulty switching medications). Methods: The present review of the literature discusses the preclinical and clinical findings on compounds that can produce immediate symptom relief. Results: These compounds include ketamine, scopolamine, and mechanistically-related drugs. Newer additions to the list of potential rapid-acting agents include antagonists of metabotropic (mGlu) 2/3 receptors, negative allosteric modulators of alpha 5-containing GABAA receptors, and psychedelic compounds. An additional benefit of these compounds is that they have demonstrated large effect sizes and, importantly, demonstrated efficacy in patient's refractory to other treatments. A drawback of some of these compounds, to date, is finding ways to expand the duration of clinical efficacy. In addition, for some compounds, the side-effect profile requires management. A primary mechanism by which rapid effects might be produced is through the amplification of excitatory neuro-transmission through activation of AMPA receptors. The extracellular efflux of glutamate induced by these drugs has been documented and provides the hypothesized triggering mechanism for AMPA receptor amplification. Conclusion: The preclinical and clinical literature strongly suggests that rapid-acting antidepressants are the current focus of antidepressant drug discovery. Promising clinical findings exist for several compounds including ketamine and other NMDA receptor antagonists, scopolamine, and psilocybin. Two compounds are in late stage clinical development: GLYX-13 (Rapastinel) and eskekamine.","[Witkin, Jeffrey M.; Rodriguez, Gabriel J.; Shi, Samuel] Witkin Consulting Grp, Carmel, IN 46033 USA; [Knutson, Daniel E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA","Witkin, JM (corresponding author), Witkin Consulting Grp, Carmel, IN 46033 USA.",witkinconsult@gmail.com,,"Knutson, Daniel/0000-0002-8043-767X",,,,78,19,19,1,22,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1381-6128,1873-4286,,CURR PHARM DESIGN,Curr.

Despite the well-recognized spectrum nature of affective disorders, modern anxiolytic drug discovery mainly targets specific pathways and molecular determinants within a single phenotypic domain. However, greater understanding of the integrative mechanisms and pathogenesis is essential in order to develop new effective therapies. Areas covered: In this review, the authors emphasize the importance of a 'domain interplay-oriented' approach to experimental affective research. They also highlight the need to expand the scope of anxiolytic drug targets to better understand the pathogenesis of anxiety-spectrum disorders. Expert opinion: There is the potential to markedly improve the utility of animal models for affective disorders. First, the authors suggest that one such way would be by analyzing the systems of several domains and their interplay to better understand disease pathogenesis.

In line with acceptance and commitment therapy's (ACT's) transdiagnostic model, qualitative research has suggested that reductions in experiential avoidance are an important component of therapeutic outcomes associated with psychedelics. However, limited research has quantitatively explored the association between decreases in experiential avoidance and therapeutic outcomes associated with psychedelics. Therefore, in two prospective studies, using convenience samples of individuals with plans to use a psychedelic, we explored the impact of psychedelic use on experiential avoidance, depression severity, and suicidal ideation, as well as relationships between changes in these outcomes. Participants (Study 1,N=104; Study 2,N=254) completed self-report questionnaires of depression severity, suicidal ideation, and experiential avoidance: 1) before using a psychedelic (in ceremonial and non-ceremonial contexts), as well as 2) 2-weeks and 3) 4-weeks after psychedelic use. Across both studies, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated significant decreases in experiential avoidance, depression severity, and suicidal ideation after psychedelic use. Furthermore, decreases in experiential avoidance were significantly associated with decreases in depression severity and suicidal ideation. These results suggest that psychedelics may lead to significant decreases in experiential avoidance, depression severity, and suicidal ideation. Additionally, these findings imply that reduced experiential avoidance may be a transdiagnostic mechanism mediating treatment success within psychedelic therapy. We conclude that integrating psychedelics with psychotherapeutic interventions that target experiential avoidance (e.g. ACT) may enhance therapeutic outcomes.","[Zeifman, Richard J.; Watts, Ros; Kettner, Hannes; Mertens, Lea J.; Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Imperial Coll London, Fac Med, Dept Brain Sci, Ctr Psychedel Res, London, England; [Wagner, Anne C.] Remedy, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mertens, Lea J.] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth CIMH, Dept Mol Neuroimaging, Mannheim, Germany","Zeifman, RJ (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Fac Med, Dept Brain Sci, Ctr Psychedel Res, London, England.",rzeifman@ryerson.ca,,,Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Alex Mosley Charitable Trust; Ad Astra Chandaria Foundation; Nikean Foundation,"RZ received funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

The ritualistic use of ayahuasca has spread throughout many countries, making it necessary to study its risks and benefits. Two sub-studies were designed for this investigation. In sub-study 1, a psychiatric interview and a battery of questionnaires were administered to subjects (n = 40) before their first ayahuasca use. Two follow-ups were conducted at 1 and 6 months. In sub-study 2, the same interview and battery of questionnaires were administered to long-term ayahuasca users (n = 23) and their scores were compared with those of the ayahuasca-naive group. In the first assessment, nearly half (45%) of the naive users were found to meet the diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. After the ayahuasca use, more than 80% of those subjects showed clinical improvements that persisted at 6 months. The questionnaires showed significant reductions in depression and psychopathology. Regarding substudy 2, long-term users showed lower depression scores, and higher scores for self-transcendence and quality of life, as compared to their peers in sub-study 1.

In the late 1950s Albert Hofmann, of Sandoz Laboratories, identified and synthesized the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin which are found in psilocybe mushrooms. Psilocybin was marketed by Sandoz as Indocybin for basic psychopharmacological and therapeutic clinical research. Psilocybin saw a rapid rise in popularity during the 1960s and was classed as a Schedule I drug in 1970. This led to a significant decrease in psilocybin research. Recently, however, preliminary studies with psilocybin have shown promise as potential for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol addiction, tobacco addiction, and major depressive disorder, and the treatment of depression in terminally ill cancer patients. This review describes in detail the synthesis, metabolism, pharmacology, adverse drug reactions, and importance of psilocybin to neuroscience in the past and present.","[Geiger, Haden A.; Wurst, Madeline G.; Daniels, R.

Psychological and existential suffering is common in cancer patients, associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Promising early-phase clinical research (1960s to early 1970s) suggested a therapeutic signal for serotoninergic psychedelics (e.g. psilocybin, LSD) in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress. After several decades of quiescence, research on psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat psychiatric disorders in cancer patients has resumed within the last 2 decades in the US and Europe. This review article is based on a systematic search of clinical trials from 1960-2018 researching the therapeutic use of psychedelic treatment in patients with serious or terminal illnesses and related psychiatric illness. The search found 10 eligible clinical trials, with a total of 445 participants, with the vast majority of the patients having advanced or terminal cancer diagnoses. Six open label trials, published between 1964 and 1980 (n = 341), suggested that psychedelic therapy (mostly with LSD) may improve cancer-related depression, anxiety, and fear of death. Four RCTs trials were published between 2011 and 2016 (n = 104), mostly with psilocybin treatment (n = 92), and demonstrated that psychedelic-assisted treatment can produce rapid, robust, and sustained improvements in cancer-related psychological and existential distress.","[Ross, Stephen] NYU, Dept Psychiat, Langone Med Ctr, Bellevue Hosp Ctr, 462 First Ave,NBV 20E7, New York, NY 10016 USA","Ross, S (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Psychiat, Langone Med Ctr, Bellevue Hosp Ctr, 462 First Ave,NBV 20E7, New York, NY 10016 USA.",stephen.Ross@nyumc.org,,,,,,57,18,18,3,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0954-0261,1369-1627,,INT REV PSYCHIATR,Int.

In this paper, we report data from a non-fatal intoxication and seven deaths involving 3-MeO-PCP in Sweden during the period March 2014 until June 2016. Case descriptions: The non-fatal intoxication case, a 19-year-old male with drug problems and a medical history of depression, was found awake but tachycardic, hypertensive, tachypnoeic and catatonic at home. After being hospitalized, his condition worsened as he developed a fever and lactic acidosis concomitant with psychomotor agitation and hallucinations. After 22 h of intensive care, the patient had made a complete recovery. During his hospitalization, a total of four blood samples were collected at different time points. The seven autopsy cases, six males and one female, were all in their twenties to thirties with psychiatric problems and/or an ongoing drug abuse. Methods: 3-MeO-PCP was identified with liquid chromatography (LC)/time-of-flight technology and quantified using LC-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: In the clinical case, the concentration of 3-MeO-PCP was 0.14 mu g/g at admission, 0.08 mu g/g 2.5 h after admission, 0.06 mu g/g 5 h after admission and 0.04 mu g/g 17 h after admission. The half-life of 3-MeO-PCP was estimated to 11 h. In the autopsy cases, femoral blood concentrations ranged from 0.05 mu g/g to 0.38 mu g/g. 3-MeO-PCP was the sole finding in the case with the highest concentration and the cause of death was established as intoxication with 3-MeO-PCP. In the remaining six autopsy cases, other medications and drugs of abuse were present as well. Conclusion: Despite being scheduled in January 2015, 3-MeO-PCP continues to be abused in Sweden. Exposure to 3-MeO-PCP may cause severe adverse events and even death, especially if the user does not receive life-supporting treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a key factor that not only promotes fibrinolysis via the activation of plasminogen, but also contributes to regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis through plasmin-mediated activation of a probrain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to mature BDNF. ProBDNE activation could potentially be supressed by competition with fibrin for plasmin and tPA. High affinity binding of plasmin and tPA to fibrin could result in a decrease of proBDNF activation during brain inflammation leading to fibrosis further perpetuating depressed mood. There is a paucity of data explaining the possible role of the fibrinolytic system or aberrant extravascular fibrin deposition in depression. We propose that within the brain, an imbalance between tPA and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and neuroserpin favors the inhibitors, resulting in changes in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation that result in depressive behavior. Our hypothesis is that peripheral inflammation mediates neuroinflammation, and that cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can inhibit the fibrinolytic system by up-regulating PAl-1 and potentially neuroserpin. We propose that the decrement of the activity of tPA and uPA occurs with downregulation of uPA in part involving the binding and clearance from the surface of neural cells of uPA/PAI-1 complexes by the urokinase receptor uPAR. We infer that current antidepressants and ketamine mitigate depressive symptoms by restoring the balance of the fibrinolytic system with increased activity of tPA and uPA with down-regulated intracerebral expression of their inhibitors. We lastly hypothesize that psychedelic 5-ht2a receptor agonists, such as psilocybin, can improve mood through anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects that include blockade of TNF-a activity leading to decreased PAI-1 activity and increased clearance. The process involves disinhibition of tPA and uPA with subsequent increased cleavage of proBDNF which promotes neurogenesis, decreased neuroinflammation, decreased fibrin deposition, normalized glial-neuronal cross-talk, and optimally functioning neuro-circuits involved in mood. We propose that psilocybin can alleviate deleterious changes in the brain caused by chronic stress leading to restoration of homeostatic brain fibrinolytic capacity leading to euthymia.

This concept expresses the idea that certain suboptimal cognitive processes may nonetheless have epistemic (knowledge-related) benefits. The idea that delusion or confabulation may have psychological benefits is familiar enough. What is novel and interesting is the idea that such conditions may also yield significant and otherwise unavailable epistemic benefits. I apply the notion of epistemic innocence to research on the transformative potential of psychedelic drugs. The popular epithet 'hallucinogen' exemplifies a view of these substances as fundamentally epistemically detrimental. I argue that the picture is more complicated and that some psychedelic states can be epistemically innocent. This conclusion is highly relevant to policy debates about psychedelic therapy. Moreover, analysing the case of psychedelics can shed further light on the concept of epistemic innocence itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is now clear, however, that the opioids are central players in mood. The implications for mood disorders, particularly clinical depression, suggest a paradigm shift from the monoamine neurotransmitters to the opioids either alone or in interaction with monoamine neurons. We have a special interest in dynorphin, the last of the major endogenous opioids to be isolated and identified. Dynorphin is derived from the Greek word for power, dynamis, which hints at the expectation that the neuropeptide held for its discoverers. Yet, dynorphin and its opioid receptor subtype, kappa, has always taken a backseat to the endogenous b-endorphin and the exogenous morphine that both bind the mu opioid receptor subtype. That may be changing as the dynorphin/kappa system has been shown to have different, often opposite, neurophysiological and behavioral influences. This includes major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we have undertaken a review of dynorphin/kappa neurobiology as related to behaviors, especially MDD. Highlights include the unique features of dynorphin and kappa receptors and the special relation of a plant-based agonist of the kappa receptor salvinorin A. In addition to acting as a kappa opioid agonist, we conclude that salvinorin A has a complex pharmacologic profile, with potential additional mechanisms of action. Its unique neurophysiological effects make Salvinorina A an ideal candidate for MDD treatment research.","[Taylor, George T.; Manzella, Francesca] Univ Missouri St Louis, Dept Psychol Sci, Behav Neurosci Program, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Taylor, George T.] Heidelberg Univ, IBF, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Manzella, F (corresponding author), Univ Missouri St Louis, Behav Neurosci Psychol, One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",fmmf47@mail.umsl.edu,,"Manzella, Francesca/0000-0003-1296-2015","Interdisciplinary Intercampus Research Program of the University of Missouri; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Bonn, Germany)Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","The authors express our gratitude to the Interdisciplinary Intercampus Research Program of the University of Missouri and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Bonn, Germany) for partial funding of this research.",,119,18,18,0,25,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1570-159X,1875-6190,,CURR NEUROPHARMACOL,Curr.

SJL mice, the antinociceptive effects were evaluated in warm-water (50 degrees C) tail withdrawal and intraplantar formaldehyde (2%) assays and the sedative effects measured with the rotarod performance task. Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine without modulating sucrose self-administration and without producing aversion, sedation, anxiety, or learning and memory impairment in rats. However, increased immobility was observed in the forced swim test indicating pro-depressive effects. Mesyl Sal B was not as potent as Sal A at reducing pain in the antinociceptive assays. In conclusion, Mesyl Sal B possesses anti-cocaine effects, is longer acting in vivo and has fewer side-effects when compared to Sal A, however, the antinociceptive effects are limited.","[Kivell, Bronwyn M.; Paton, Kelly F.; Kumar, Nitin; Morani, Aashish S.; Culverhouse, Aimee; Shepherd, Amy; Welsh, Susan A.; Biggerstaff, Andrew] Victoria Univ Wellington, Ctr Biodiscovery, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand; [Crowley, Rachel S.; Prisinzano, Thomas E.] Univ Kansas, Dept Med Chem, Lawrence, KS USA","Kivell, BM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Ctr Biodiscovery, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",bronwyn.kivell@vuw.ac.nz; kelly.paton@vuw.ac.nz; nitin23784@yahoo.com; aashu110@gmail.com; aimee.culverhouse@vuw.ac.nz; shepheamy@gmail.com; midgii@gmail.com; Andy.Biggerstaff@vuw.ac.nz; crowleyrachels@outlook.com; prisinza@ku.edu,"Paton, Kelly/N-5863-2019; Prisinzano, Thomas E/B-7877-2010; Shepherd, Amy/U-5970-2017; Kivell, Bronwyn/P-3140-2014","Paton, Kelly/0000-0002-5334-5497; Shepherd, Amy/0000-0002-8929-5735; Crowley, Rachel/0000-0001-6366-5577; Prisinzano, Thomas/0000-0002-0649-8052; Kivell, Bronwyn/0000-0001-9699-553X","Health Research Council [16/646]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01DA01851]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM008545, P20GM113117] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA018151] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This study was supported by grants from the Health Research Council (B.M.K.: 16/646) and NIH (T.E.P.: R01DA01851).,,117,17,17,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,OCT,2018,23,10,10.3390/molecules23102602,,,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,HB6SF,WOS:000451201400198,30314288,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2021-12-21,

Following the accidental discovery of its potent psychoactive effects in 1943, it was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories as an experimental drug that might be useful as an adjunct for psychotherapy, or to give psychiatrists insight into the mental processes in their patients. The finding of serotonin in the mammalian brain in 1953, and its structural resemblance to LSD, quickly led to ideas that serotonin in the brain might be involved in mental disorders, initiating rapid research interest in the neurochemistry of serotonin. LSD proved to be physiologically very safe and nonaddictive, with a very low incidence of adverse events when used in controlled experiments. Widely hailed by psychiatry as a breakthrough in the 1950s and early 1960s, clinical research with LSD ended by about 1970, when it was formally placed into Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 following its growing popularity as a recreational drug. Within the past 5 years, clinical research with LSD has begun in Europe, but there has been none in the United States. LSD is proving to be a powerful tool to help understand brain dynamics when combined with modern brain imaging methods. It remains to be seen whether therapeutic value for LSD can be confirmed in controlled clinical trials, but promising results have been obtained in small pilot trials of depression, anxiety, and addictions using psilocybin, a related psychedelic molecule.","[Nichols, David E.] Univ N Carolina, Eshelman Sch Pharm, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Nichols, DE (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Eshelman Sch Pharm, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",denichol@email.unc.edu,,,,,,100,17,17,4,49,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7193,,,ACS CHEM NEUROSCI,ACS Chem.

Our understanding of how 5-HT2A activation may cause the effects of hallucinogens has been hampered by the receptor unselectivity of most of the drugs of this class. Here we used 25CN-NBOH (N-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenylethylamine), a newly developed selective 5-HT2A agonist, and tested it with regard to the head-twitch-response (HTR) model of 5-HT2A activity and effects on locomotion. 25CN-NBOH evoked HTRs with an inverted u-shape-like dose-response curve and highest efficacy at 1.5 mg/kg, i.p. HTR occurrence peaked within 5 min after agonist injection, and exponentially decreased to half-maximal frequency at 11 min. Thorough habituation to the experimental procedures (including handling, saline injection, and exposure to the observational boxes 1 day before the experiment) facilitated the animals' response to 25CN-NBOH. 25CN-NBOH (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced HTRs were blocked by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (0.75 mg/kg. 30 min pre), but not by the 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min pre). SB-242084 instead slightly increased the number of HTRs occurring at a 3.0-mg/kg dose of the agonist. Apart from HTR induction, 25CN-NBOH also modestly increased locomotor activity of the mice. Repeated once-per-day injections (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) led to reduced occurrence of 25CN-NBOH induced HTRs. This intermediate tolerance was augmented when a second (higher) dose of the drug (3.0 mg/kg) was interspersed. Short-interval tolerance (i.e., tachyphylaxis) was observed when the drug was injected twice at intervals of 1.0 and 1.5 h at either dose tested (1.5 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively). Inducing ketanserin-sensitive HTRs, which are dependent on environmental valences and which show signs of tachyphylaxis and tolerance, 25CN-NBOH shares striking features common to serotonergic hallucinogens. Given its distinct in vitro selectivity for 5-HT2A over non5-HT2 receptors and its behavioral dynamics, 25CN-NBOH appears to be a powerful tool for dissection of receptor-specific cortical circuit dynamics, including 5-HT2A related psychoactivity.","[Buchborn, Tobias; Lyons, Taylor; Knopfel, Thomas] Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, Lab Neuronal Circuit Dynam, London, England; [Knopfel, Thomas] Imperial Coll London, Inst Biomed Engn, Ctr Neurotechnol, London, England","Knopfel, T (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, Lab Neuronal Circuit Dynam, London, England.; Knopfel, T (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Inst Biomed Engn, Ctr Neurotechnol, London, England.",tknopfel@knopfel-lab.net,"Knopfel, Thomas/B-1128-2008; Lyons, Taylor/AAM-7410-2020","Knopfel, Thomas/0000-0002-5718-0765; Lyons, Taylor/0000-0002-3118-7344; Buchborn, Tobias/0000-0003-0538-5184",European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Imperial College; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC); Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [1753443] Funding Source: researchfish,"This study was supported by the European Commission (TB, TK), funds provided by Imperial College (TK), NIH (TK), and by MRC (TL).",,44,17,17,0,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-9812,,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

However, these are only partially effective. Hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, may represent potential new treatment options for SUD. This review provides a summary of (human) studies on the putative therapeutic effects of psilocybin, and discusses the receptor systems, brain regions and cognitive and emotional processes mediating psilocybin's effects. Psilocybin's chemical structure is similar to that of serotonin. Dysregulations in the serotonin system are associated with alterations in stress hormones, such as cortisol, and mood disorders. After psilocybin administration cortisol levels spike and activate the executive control network, with subsequent increased control over emotional processes, and relief of negative thinking and persistent negative emotions. Preliminary data of ongoing alcohol and smoking addiction studies in humans shows promising effects of psilocybin administration on substance use. Importantly, psilocybin has a low risk of toxicity and dependence and can be used safely under controlled clinical conditions.Areas covered: This paper is a narrative review based on the search terms: psilocybin, substance use disorder, addiction, depression, serotonin. Literature on potential efficacy and mechanisms of action of psilocybin in SUD is discussed.Expert commentary: Recent positive findings with psilocybin need confirmation in well-designed placebo controlled randomized trials employing a large sample size.","[de Veen, Bas T.

This study of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients explores: (1) changes in symptom distress over 4 months; and (2) factors predicting changes in symptom distress. Methods: A prospective longitudinal design was used to collect data from breast cancer patients in northern Taiwan. A set of questionnaires was used to measure anxiety, symptom distress, social support, and demographic and treatment-related characteristics. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with least significant difference (LSD) was used to examine differences in symptom distress, state anxiety, and social-support levels across four time-points. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) is used to determine predictors for the change in symptom distress. Results: Participants showed mild overall symptom distress during treatment that increased from cancer diagnosis to treatment phases, with a peak at 4 months after diagnosis. Insomnia was the most commonly identified distressful symptom over time. Changes in overall symptom distress were significantly predicted by state anxiety, health professional support, and time since cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: Change in symptom distress following the first 4 months after diagnosis was predicted by state anxiety, health professional support, and time. Patients should receive social support and be trained in problem-solving skills to relieve distressful symptoms from diagnosis through treatment.

Recently, salvinorin A (Sal A), a naturally occurring KOPr agonist, has been shown to attenuate cocaine-induced drug seeking in a model of relapse in rats. The present study evaluated the effects of acute Sal A exposure on cocaine-induced hyperactivity and cocaine sensitization in rats. Acute treatment with a dose of Sal A that decreased drug seeking in a previous study (0.3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the expression of cocaine sensitization. This dose of Sal A failed to affect spontaneous locomotion or to produce a conditioned taste aversion to a novel-tasting saccharin solution. However, Sal A decreased climbing and swimming time and increased time spent immobile in the forced swim test. These findings indicate that Sal A, just like traditional KOPr agonists, attenuates cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization but does not produce the adverse effect of conditioned aversion, suggesting improved potential compliance. However, prodepressive effects were also produced and these effects may limit the therapeutic potential.

Although the main focus was on efficacy and safety, study characteristics, duration of antidepressants effects across studies, and the role of the subjective drug experiences were also reviewed and presented. Method A systematic literature search (1 Jan 2000 to 1 May 2020) was conducted in PubMed and PsychINFO for studies of patients undergoing treatment with a serotonergic psychedelic. Results Data from 16 papers, representing 10 independent psychedelic-assisted therapy trials (psilocybin = 7, ayahuasca = 2, LSD = 1), were extracted, presented in figures and tables, and narratively synthesized and discussed. Across these studies, a total of 188 patients suffering either cancer- or illness-related anxiety and depression disorders (C/I-RADD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or substance use disorder (SUD) were included. The reviewed studies established feasibility and evidence of safety, alongside promising early data of efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, OCD, and tobacco and alcohol use disorders. For a majority of patients, the therapeutic effects appeared to be long-lasting (weeks-months) after only 1 to 3 treatment session(s). All studies were conducted in line with guidelines for the safe conduct of psychedelic therapy, and no severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion The resurrection of clinical psychedelic research provides early evidence for treatment efficacy and safety for a range of psychiatric conditions, and constitutes an exciting new treatment avenue in a health area with major unmet needs.","[Andersen, Kristoffer A.

However, the mechanisms of action involved in ayahuasca's therapeutic effects are unclear. Mindfulness and cognitive flexibility may be two possible psychological mechanisms. Like other classic psychedelics, ayahuasca also leads to an 'afterglow' effect of improved subjective well-being that persists after the acute effects have subsided. This period may offer a window of increased therapeutic potential. Objective To explore changes in mindfulness and cognitive flexibility before and within 24 h after ayahuasca use. Methods Forty-eight participants (54% female) were assessed on measures of mindfulness (Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)), and cognitive flexibility (Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS)), and completed the Stroop and Wisconsin Picture Card Sorting Task (WPCST) before drinking ayahuasca, and again within 24 h. Results Mindfulness (FFMQ total scores and four of the five mindfulness facets: observe, describe, act with awareness, and non-reactivity) and decentering (EQ) significantly increased in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Cognitive flexibility (CFS and WPCST) significantly improved in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Changes in both mindfulness and cognitive flexibility were not influenced by prior ayahuasca use. Conclusions The present study supports ayahuasca's ability to enhance mindfulness and further reports changes in cognitive flexibility in the 'afterglow' period occur, suggesting both could be possible psychological mechanisms concerning the psychotherapeutic effects of ayahuasca. Given psychological gains occurred regardless of prior ayahuasca use suggests potentially therapeutic effects for both naive and experienced ayahuasca drinkers.","[Murphy-Beiner, A.; Soar, K.] Univ East London, Sch Psychol, Water Lane, London E15 4LZ, England","Soar, K (corresponding author), Univ East London, Sch Psychol, Water Lane, London E15 4LZ, England.",k.soar@uel.ac.uk,,,,,,44,16,16,3,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,APR,2020,237,4,10.1007/s00213-019-05445-3,,,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,KY8QK,WOS:000522840800019,31927605,,,,2021-12-21,

This article presents a conceptual model that specifies potential psychological mechanisms underlying such change, and that shows substantial parallels between psychedelic therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy: We propose that in the carefully controlled context of psychedelic therapy as applied in contemporary clinical research, psychedelic-induced belief relaxation can increase motivation for acceptance via operant conditioning, thus engendering episodes of relatively avoidance-free exposure to greatly intensified private events. Under these unique learning conditions, relaxed avoidance-related beliefs can be exposed to corrective information and become revised accordingly, which may explain long-term increases in acceptance and corresponding reductions in psychopathology.

The present study was to elucidate metabolic difference of harmaline and harmine in 11 mammalian liver microsomes in order to quantitate species-specific metabolic profiles. Using the probe substrate reaction, the enzymatic activities for 8 CYP450 isozymes of 11 liver microsomes were characterized. Combining ultra performance liquid chromatography combinedwith electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandemmass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q/TOF-MS) and ultra performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/ MS) methods, 18 metabolites for harmaline and 11 for harmine were identified. The metabolism patterns differences of them presented discrepancy in the quality and quantity of metabolites. It was notable that O-sulfate conjugation was detected in all species except sheep. The intrinsic clearance CLint,LM values for the metabolites harmine and harmol in rabbits (37.5 and 42.4 mu L/min/mg) were higher than those in other animals, while dogs (16.2 and 16.7 mu L/min/mg) and humans (16.0 and 16.3 mu L/min/mg) exhibited similar in vitro metabolic clearance. These observations suggested that harmaline and harmine were rapidly metabolized in liver microsomes of rat, mouse, and rabbit; moderately metabolized in human and dog; while weakly metabolized in sheep. Comprehensive analysis of the metabolism indicated that dogs and humans showed considerable similarity in the elimination of parent drugs, metabolic profiles, and catalytic processes. To summarize, these findings illustrated that in vitro studies of harmaline and harmine metabolic profiles in different species are helpful for the proper selection and interpretation of animal models for pharmacological and toxicological evaluation, and will ultimately provide useful guidance for the development of beta-carboline alkaloids.

However, many basic pharmacological and toxicological questions remain unanswered with regard to these compounds. In this study, we discuss psychedelic medicine as well as the behavioral and toxicological effects of hallucinogenic drugs in zebrafish. We emphasize this aquatic organism as a model ideally suited to assess both the potential toxic and therapeutic effects of major known classes of hallucinogenic compounds. In addition, novel drugs with hallucinogenic properties can be efficiently screened using zebrafish models. Well-designed preclinical studies utilizing zebrafish can contribute to the reemerging treatment paradigm of psychedelic medicine, leading to new avenues of clinical exploration for psychiatric disorders.","[Kyzar, Evan J.] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, 1601 West Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Kalueff, Allan V.] Guangdong Ocean Univ GDOU, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Res Inst Marine Drugs & Nutr, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China; [Kalueff, Allan V.] ZENEREI Inst, Slidell, LA USA; [Kalueff, Allan V.] St Petersburg State Univ, Inst Translat Biomed, St Petersburg, Russia; [Kalueff, Allan V.] Ural Fed Univ, Inst Chem Technol, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Kalueff, Allan V.] Ural Fed Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Kalueff, Allan V.] Int Zebrafish Neurosci Res Consortium ZNRC, Slidell, LA USA","Kyzar, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, 1601 West Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.; Kalueff, AV (corresponding author), Guangdong Ocean Univ, Res Inst Marine Drugs & Nutr, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Zhanjiang 524025, Peoples R China.",ekyzar2@uic.edu; avkalueff@gmail.com,,"Kyzar, Evan/0000-0002-7688-0281",Guangdong Ocean University; St. Petersburg State University [1.38.201.2014]; Ural Federal University (the government of Russian Federation) [2-A03.21.0006],"A.V.K. is the chair of ZNRC.

They were shown to be more stable and permeable, and acted as potent mu-opioid receptor agonists. In this study we report that the C8LAA modification resulted in successful systemic delivery of both analogues. They produced potent dose-dependent pain relief in a chronic constriction injury-rat model of neuropathic pain after intravenous administration with ED50 values obtained at 6.58 (+/- 1.22) mu mol/kg for 3 and 6.18 (+/- 1.17) mu mol/kg for 4. Using two different rat models of constipation that assess the effects of mu-opioid receptor agonists on stool hydration and gastro-intestinal motility, compound 3 produced insignificant constipation at 16 mu mol/kg, whereas morphine elicited significant constipation at 2 mu mol/kg. Compound 3 in contrast to morphine, did not attenuate the hypercapnic ventilatory response at 5 mu mol/kg, a dose that fully alleviated hindpaw sensitivity at the time of peak effect in CCI-rats.

It is a high-affinity antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and also binds to opioid mu and sigma receptors. Ketamine is being intensively investigated as an antidepressant therapy. To date, five short-term controlled studies and other open-label studies in patients with unipolar or bipolar depression have demonstrated that intravenous ketamine is safe and has a rapid and profound short-term effect on depressive symptoms, including suicidal thoughts, even among patients considered treatment-resistant to standard medications or electroconvulsive therapy. Before ketamine can be incorporated into clinical practice, however, its long-term safety and effectiveness need to be evaluated. Although the effectiveness of alternative routes of ketamine administration (i.e., oral, intranasal, or intramuscular) needs to be determined, intravenous ketamine could be conceptualized as a clinic-based procedural therapy for treatment-resistant forms of depression.","Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Western Psychiat Inst & Clin, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Howland, RH (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Western Psychiat Inst & Clin, 3811 OHara St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",HowlandRH@upmc.edu,"Lanzenberger, Rupert/I-5438-2019; Howland, Robert H/K-6937-2015","Lanzenberger, Rupert/0000-0003-4641-9539; Howland, Robert H/0000-0002-6533-6010",,,,16,16,16,0,15,SLACK INC,THOROFARE,"6900 GROVE RD, THOROFARE, NJ 08086 USA",0279-3695,1938-2413,,J PSYCHOSOC NURS MEN,J.

However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT1A (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment.","[Preller, Katrin H.; Duerler, Patricia; Vollenweider, Franz X.] Univ Hosp Psychiat Zurich, Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging Unit, Zurich, Switzerland; [Stampfli, Philipp; Seifritz, Erich] Univ Hosp Psychiat Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Preller, Katrin H.; Burt, Joshua B.; Ji, Jie Lisa; Adkinson, Brendan; Krystal, John H.; Murray, John D.; Anticevic, Alan] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Murray, John D.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT USA; [Burt, Joshua B.; Murray, John D.] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT USA; [Repovs, Grega] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Psychol, Mind & Brain Lab, Ljubljana, Slovenia","Preller, KH (corresponding author), Zurich Univ Hosp Psychiat, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Neuropsychopharmacol & Brain Imaging Unit, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",preller@bli.uzh.ch,,"Adkinson, Brendan/0000-0003-3196-8674; Vollenweider, Franz/0000-0001-9053-6164; Repovs, Grega/0000-0003-1837-3879","Heffter Research Institute [1190420]; Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation [2016-0111]; Swiss National Science Foundation under the framework of Neuron Cofund [01EW1908]; Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [J7-8275, J7-6829, P3-0338]; SFARI Pilot Award; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1U01MH121766, R01MH112746, 5R01MH112189, 5R01MH108590, 5P50AA012870]","This work was supported by the Heffter Research Institute (Grant No. 1190420), Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation (Grant No. 2016-0111), Swiss National Science Foundation under the framework of Neuron Cofund (Grant No. 01EW1908), Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) (Grant Nos.

We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of ayahuasca with treatment-resistant depression patients (n= 28) and healthy controls (n= 45). Aims: We are evaluating the blood inflammatory biomarkers: C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, as a potential consequence of ayahuasca intake and their correlation with serum cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Blood samples were collected at pre-treatment and 48 hours after substance ingestion to assess the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers, together with administration of the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale. Results: At pre-treatment, patients showed higher C-reactive protein levels than healthy controls and a significant negative correlation between C-reactive protein and serum cortisol levels was revealed (rho= -0.40,n= 14). C-reactive protein in those patients was not correlated with Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale scores. We observed a significant reduction of C-reactive protein levels across time in both patients and controls treated with ayahuasca, but not with placebo. Patients treated with ayahuasca showed a significant correlation (rho= + 0.57) between larger reductions of C-reactive protein and lower depressive symptoms at 48 hours after substance ingestion (Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale). No significant result with respect to interleukin 6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor was found. Furthermore, these biomarkers did not predict the antidepressant response or remission rates observed. Conclusions: These findings enhance the understanding of the biological mechanisms behind the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and encourage further clinical trials in adults with depression.","[Galvao-Coelho, Nicole Leite; de Menezes Galvao, Ana Cecilia; de Almeida, Raissa Nobrega] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Physiol & Behav, Lab Hormone Measurement, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Galvao-Coelho, Nicole Leite; de Menezes Galvao, Ana Cecilia; de Almeida, Raissa Nobrega] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Program Psychobiol, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Galvao-Coelho, Nicole Leite; de Menezes Galvao, Ana Cecilia; de Almeida, Raissa Nobrega] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Physiol & Behav, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Galvao-Coelho, Nicole Leite; Soares, Bruno Lobao; Maia-de-Oliveira, Joao Paulo] Natl Sci & Technol Inst Translat Med, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Palhano-Fontes, Fernanda; Braga, Isaac Campos; de Araujo, Draulio Barros] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Brain Inst, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Palhano-Fontes, Fernanda; Braga, Isaac Campos; Maia-de-Oliveira, Joao Paulo; de Araujo, Draulio Barros] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Onofre Lopes Univ Hosp, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Soares, Bruno Lobao] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Biophys & Pharmacol, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Maia-de-Oliveira, Joao Paulo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Clin Med, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Perkins, Daniel] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sarris, Jerome] Western Sydney Univ, NICM Hlth Res Inst, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [Sarris, Jerome] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne Clin, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Galvao-Coelho, NL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Fisiol & Comportamento, Caixa Postal 1511, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil.",nicolelgalvaocoelho@gmail.com,"; de Araujo, Draulio/I-6038-2012","Galvao, Ana Cecilia/0000-0003-0073-877X; de Araujo, Draulio/0000-0002-6934-2485; Braga, Isaac/0000-0003-2604-2877; Perkins, Daniel/0000-0002-2055-1649","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [466760/2014, 479466/2013]; CAPES Foundation within the Brazilian Ministry of EducationCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [1677/2012, 1577/2013]; National Science and Technology Institute for Translational Medicine [INCT-TM Fapesp 2014/50891-1, CNPq 465458/2014-9]; CAPES Foundation from Brazilian Ministry of EducationCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88887.466701/2019-00]; NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1125000]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, grants 466760/2014 and 479466/2013), CAPES Foundation within the Brazilian Ministry of Education (grants 1677/2012 and 1577/2013) and by National Science and Technology Institute for Translational Medicine (INCT-TM Fapesp 2014/50891-1; CNPq 465458/2014-9).

Even less is known about the neural correlates of subacute effects taking place days after the psychedelic experience. This study explores the subacute changes of primary sensory brain networks and networks supporting higher-order affective and self-referential functions 24 hours after a single session with the psychedelic ayahuasca. Methods: We leveraged task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data 1 day before and 1 day after a randomized placebo-controlled trial exploring the effects of ayahuasca in naive healthy participants (21 placebo/22 ayahuasca). We derived intra- and inter-network functional connectivity of the salience, default mode, visual, and sensorimotor networks, and assessed post-session connectivity changes between the ayahuasca and placebo groups. Connectivity changes were associated with Hallucinogen Rating Scale scores assessed during the acute effects. Results: Our findings revealed increased anterior cingulate cortex connectivity within the salience network, decreased posterior cingulate cortex connectivity within the default mode network, and increased connectivity between the salience and default mode networks 1 day after the session in the ayahuasca group compared to placebo. Connectivity of primary sensory networks did not differ between groups. Salience network connectivity increases correlated with altered somesthesia scores, decreased default mode network connectivity correlated with altered volition scores, and increased salience default mode network connectivity correlated with altered affect scores. Conclusion: These findings provide preliminary evidence for subacute functional changes induced by the psychedelic ayahuasca on higher-order cognitive brain networks that support interoceptive, affective, and self-referential functions.","[Pasquini, Lorenzo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Memory & Aging Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Palhano-Fontes, Fernanda; Araujo, Draulio B.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Inst Brain, Ave Nascimento Castro 2155, BR-59056 Natal, RN, Brazil","Araujo, DB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Inst Brain, Ave Nascimento Castro 2155, BR-59056 Natal, RN, Brazil.",draulio@neuro.ufrn.br,,"Pasquini, Lorenzo/0000-0002-7899-7061","German Academic Foundation; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [466760/2014, 479466/2013]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [1677/2012, 1577/2013]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: LP was supported by the German Academic Foundation.

In contrast to the presumed actions of antidepressants, we recently found increased amygdala responsiveness to fearful faces one day after open-label treatment with psilocybin (25 mg) in 19 patients with treatment-resistant depression, which correlated with treatment efficacy. Aims: Aiming to further unravel the therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin, the present study extends this basic activation analysis. We hypothesised changed amygdala functional connectivity, more precisely decreased amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, during face processing after treatment with psilocybin. Methods: Psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted on functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a classic face/emotion perception task, with the bilateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex time-series as physiological regressors. Average parameter estimates (beta weights) of significant clusters were correlated with clinical outcomes at one week. Results: Results showed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-right amygdala functional connectivity during face processing post- (versus pre-) treatment; this decrease was associated with levels of rumination at one week. This effect was driven by connectivity changes in response to fearful and neutral (but not happy) faces. Independent whole-brain analyses also revealed a post-treatment increase in functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to occipital-parietal cortices during face processing. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the idea that psilocybin therapy revives emotional responsiveness on a neural and psychological level, which may be a key treatment mechanism for psychedelic therapy. Future larger placebo-controlled studies are needed to examine the replicability of the current findings.","[Mertens, Lea J.; Wall, Matthew B.; Roseman, Leor; Nutt, David J.; Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Psychedel Res, London, England; [Wall, Matthew B.; Roseman, Leor; Demetriou, Lysia] Hammersmith Hosp, Invicro, London, England; [Wall, Matthew B.; Roseman, Leor] UCL, Clin Psychopharmacol Unit, London, England; [Roseman, Leor] Imperial Coll London, C3NL, London, England; [Demetriou, Lysia] Imperial Coll London, Invest Med, London, England","Mertens, LJ (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, CIMH, Dept Mol Neuroimaging, J5, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",lea.mertens@zi-mannheim.de,,"Roseman, Leor/0000-0001-9990-6029; Demetriou, Lysia/0000-0001-5249-0900; Wall, Matthew B/0000-0002-0493-6274; Carhart-Harris, Robin/0000-0002-6062-7150",UK Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC); Alex Mosley Charitable Trust,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This trial was funded by a UK Medical Research Council Grant and the Alex Mosley Charitable Trust.

Recent clinical trials involving psychedelic-assisted therapy have generally employed a similar three-part structure consisting of preparation, support during the dosing sessions, and subsequent integration. However, the content of these sessions and the frame through which the therapists approach participants and understand the clinical process has thus far been inconsistent among studies. In designing a manualized therapy protocol for a small clinical trial of psilocybin-assisted therapy for major depressive disorder, our group sought to delineate an explicit and replicable, evidence-based model that intentionally builds upon both the neurobiological actions of the medication and the phenomenology of the drug experience. Having identified considerable concordance in proposed mechanisms of change between Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and psilocybin therapy, we employed ACT as an overarching psychotherapeutic framework. We hypothesize that the psilocybin experience can provide direct experiential contact with ACT processes that increase psychological flexibility, and that these deeply felt experiences may in turn be reinforced during ACT-informed follow-up therapy sessions. In this paper, we describe the rationale for selecting ACT, areas of potential synergism between ACT and psilocybin-therapy, the basic structure of our treatment model, and limitations to this approach.","[Sloshower, Jordan; Krause, Robert; Wallace, Ryan M.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 300 George St,Suite 901, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Sloshower, Jordan] VA Connecticut Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychiat, West Haven, CT USA; [Guss, Jeffrey] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Krause, Robert] Yale Sch Nursing, New Haven, CT USA; [Williams, Monnica T.; Reed, Sara] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [Skinta, Matthew D.] Roosevelt Univ, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Sloshower, J (corresponding author), Yale Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 300 George St,Suite 901, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",jordan.sloshower@yale.edu,"Williams, Monnica/O-8209-2017","Williams, Monnica/0000-0003-0095-3277",Heffter Research Institute,This work was supported by the Heffter Research Institute.,,48,15,15,3,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-1447,2212-1455,,J CONTEXT BEHAV SCI,J.

Efforts to optimize and improve pathway performance using multiple genetic optimization techniques were evaluated, resulting in a 32-fold improvement in psilocybin titer. Further enhancements to this genetically superior strain were achieved through fermentation optimization, ultimately resulting in a fed-batch fermentation study, with a production titer of 1.16 g/L of psilocybin.

Given increasing suicide rates and limitations surrounding current interventions, there is an urgent need for innovative interventions for suicidality. Although ayahuasca has been shown to target mental health concerns associated with suicidality (i.e., depression and hopelessness), research has not yet explored the impact of ayahuasca on suicidality. Therefore, we conducted secondary analyses of a randomized placebo-controlled trial in which individuals with treatment-resistant depression were administered one dose of ayahuasca (n = 14) or placebo (n = 15). Suicidality was assessed by a trained psychiatrist at baseline, as well as 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days after the intervention. A fixed-effects linear mixed model, as well as between and within-groups Cohen's d effect sizes were used to examine changes in suicidality. Controlling for baseline suicidality, we found a significant effect for time (p < .05). The effect of the intervention (i.e., ayahuasca vs. placebo) trended toward significance (p = .088). At all time points, we found medium between-group effect sizes (i.e., ayahuasca vs. placebo; day 1 Cohen's d = 0.58; day 2 d = 0.56; day 7 d = 0.67), as well as large within-group (ayahuasca; day 1 Cohen's d = 1.33; day 2 d = 1.42; day 7 d = 1.19) effect sizes, for decreases in suicidality. Conclusions: This research is the first to explore the impact of ayahuasca on suicidality. The findings suggest that ayahuasca may show potential as an intervention for suicidality. We highlight important limitations of the study, potential mechanisms, and future directions for research on ayahuasca as an intervention for suicidality.","[Zeifman, Richard J.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Psychedel Res, Dept Brain Sci, Fac Med, London, England; [Palhano-Fontes, Fernanda; Araujo, Draulio B.] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Norte UFRN, Inst Brain, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Palhano-Fontes, Fernanda; Arcoverde, Emerson; Maia-Oliveira, Joao Paulo; Araujo, Draulio B.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Onofre Lopes Univ Hosp, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Hallak, Jaime] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Neurosci & Behav, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil","Araujo, DB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande do Norte UFRN, Inst Brain, Natal, RN, Brazil.; Araujo, DB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Onofre Lopes Univ Hosp, Natal, RN, Brazil.",draulio@neuro.ufrn.br,"Nunes, Emerson/AAX-9547-2020; de Araujo, Draulio/I-6038-2012","Nunes, Emerson/0000-0002-2001-4536; de Araujo, Draulio/0000-0002-6934-2485","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [466760/2014, 479466/2013]; CAPES FoundationCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [1677/2012, 1577/2013]","Funded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, grants #466760/2014 & #479466/2013), and by the CAPES Foundation (grants #1677/2012 & #1577/2013).",,86,15,15,2,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-9812,,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

While generally positive, responses to psychedelic drugs can vary according to traits, setting, and mental state (set) before and during ingestion. Most earlier models explain minimal response variation, primarily related to dosage and trust, but a recent study found that states of surrender and preoccupation at the time of ingestion explained substantial variance in mystical and adverse psilocybin experiences. Objectives The current study sought to replicate the previous model, extend the model with additional predictors, and examine the role of mystical experience on positive change. Method A hierarchical regression model was created with crowdsourced retrospective data from 183 individuals who had self-administered psilocybin in the past year. Scales explored mental states before, during, and after psilocybin ingestion, relying on open-ended memory prompts at each juncture to trigger recollections. Controlled drug administration was not employed. Results This study replicated the previous model, finding a state of surrender before ingestion a key predictor of optimal experience and preoccupation a key predictor of adverse experience. Additional predictors added to the explanatory power for optimal and adverse experience. The model supported the importance of mystical experiences to long-term change. Conclusion Mental states of surrender or preoccupation at the time of ingestion explain variance in mystical or adverse psilocybin experiences, and mystical experiences relate to long-term positive change.

Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating cancer-related anxiety and depression. A double-blind controlled trial was performed, where 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned to treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin in conjunction with psychotherapy. Previously published results of this trial demonstrated that, in conjunction with psychotherapy, moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust, and enduring anxiolytic, and anti-depressant effects. Here, we illustrate unique clinical courses described by four participants using quantitative measures of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and spiritual well-being, as well as qualitative interviews, written narratives, and clinician notes. Although the content of each psilocybin-assisted experience was unique to each participant, several thematic similarities and differences across the various sessions stood out. These four participants' personal narratives extended beyond the cancer diagnosis itself, frequently revolving around themes of self-compassion and love, acceptance of death, and memories of past trauma, though the specific details or narrative content differ substantially. The results presented here demonstrate the personalized nature of the subjective experiences elicited through treatment with psilocybin, particularly with respect to the spiritual and/or psychological needs of each patient.","[Malone, Tara C.; Mennenga, Sarah E.; Guss, Jeffrey; Podrebarac, Samantha K.; Owens, Lindsey T.; Bossis, Anthony P.; Bogenschutz, Michael P.; Ross, Stephen] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Belser, Alexander B.] NYU, Dept Appl Psychol, New York, NY USA; [Agin-Liebes, Gabrielle] Palo Alto Univ, Palo Alto, CA USA","Ross, S (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10003 USA.",stephen.ross@nyumc.org,"Mennenga, Sarah E/N-9236-2016; Agin-Liebes, Gabrielle/AAQ-7978-2021","Mennenga, Sarah E/0000-0002-9279-2409; Bogenschutz, Michael/0000-0003-4530-3470","Heffter Research Institute; RiverStyx Foundation; New York University-Health and Hospitals Corporation (NYU-HHC) Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) (NYU CTSA grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health) [UL1 TR000038]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001445] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was supported by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, and the New York University-Health and Hospitals Corporation (NYU-HHC) Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) (NYU CTSA grant UL1 TR000038 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health).

Here, we used a machine learning algorithm applied to natural speech to ask whether language properties measured before psilocybin for treatment-resistant can predict for which patients it will be effective and for which it will not. Methods: A baseline autobiographical memory interview was conducted and transcribed. Patients with treatment-resistant depression received 2 doses of psilocybin, 10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart. Psychological support was provided before, during and after all dosing sessions. Quantitative speech measures were applied to the interview data from 17 patients and 18 untreated age-matched healthy control subjects. A machine learning algorithm was used to classify between controls and patients and predict treatment response. Results: Speech analytics and machine learning successfully differentiated depressed patients from healthy controls and identified treatment responders from non-responders with a significant level of 85% of accuracy (75% precision). Conclusions: Automatic natural language analysis was used to predict effective response to treatment with psilocybin, suggesting that these tools offer a highly cost-effective facility for screening individuals for treatment suitability and sensitivity. Limitations: The sample size was small and replication is required to strengthen inferences on these results.","[Carrillo, Facundo; Fernandez Slezak, Diego] Buenos Aires Univ, Appl Artificial Intelligence Lab, Dept Comp Sci, Sch Sci,CONICET, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Carrillo, Facundo; Fernandez Slezak, Diego] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Inst Invest Ciencias Comp ICC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Sigman, Mariano] Univ Torcuato Tella, CONICET, Integrat Neurosci Lab, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ashton, Philip; Fitzgerald, Lily; Stroud, Jack; Nutt, David J.; Carhart-Harris, Robin L.] Imperial Coll London, Psychedel Res Grp, Ctr Psychiat, Dept Med, London, England","Carrillo, F (corresponding author), Buenos Aires Univ, Appl Artificial Intelligence Lab, Dept Comp Sci, Sch Sci,CONICET, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",fcarrillo@dc.uba.ar,"Slezak, Diego Fernandez/AAD-9543-2019",,Alex Mosley Charitable Trust; UK MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/J00460X/1]; Microsoft Faculty Fellowship; James McDonnell Foundation 21st Century Science Initiative in Understanding Human Cognition; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/J00460X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Robin L.

The aim of this study was to propose a prenatal treatment with ketamine, a psychedelic drug that acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of glutamate NMDA receptors, as a neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia. The drug was applied (i.m. 60mg.kg(-1)h(-1)) in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats on gestational Day 14. Offspring behavior was studied on pubertal (4 weeks old) and adult (10 weeks old) stages. Also, hippocampal CA1-CA3 morphology was assessed in adult animals through a Nissl stain. Results showed a disinhibition and hyperactive behavior in pubertal animals exposed to ketamine, followed in adulthood with cognitive impairments, social withdrawal, anxiety, depression, and aggressive-like behaviors. In the hippocampus, a reduction of the CA3 layer thickness was observed, without changes in cell density. These results strongly suggest a robust link between prenatal pharmacologic manipulation of NMDA receptors and schizophrenia.","[Coronel-Oliveros, Carlos M.; Pacheco-Calderon, Renny] Univ Carabobo, Lab Neurociencias & Comportamiento LabNeC, CEZA, Fac Expt Ciencias & Tecnol FACyT, Valencia 2005, Venezuela","Pacheco-Calderon, R (corresponding author), Univ Carabobo, Lab Neurociencias & Comportamiento LabNeC, CEZA, Fac Expt Ciencias & Tecnol FACyT, Valencia 2005, Venezuela.",rjpacheco@uc.edu.ve,,"Pacheco-Calderon, Renny/0000-0002-3701-5797","Laboratorio de Neurociencias y Comportamiento (LabNeC), Universidad de Carabobo; Consejo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Humanistico, Universidad de Carabobo [CDCH AM-012-2014]; Fundacion Carabobensis, Facultad Experimental de Ciencias y Tecnologia, Universidad de Carabobo","Laboratorio de Neurociencias y Comportamiento (LabNeC), Universidad de Carabobo; Consejo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Humanistico (CDCH AM-012-2014), Universidad de Carabobo; Fundacion Carabobensis, Facultad Experimental de Ciencias y Tecnologia, Universidad de Carabobo",,76,15,16,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1630,1098-2302,,DEV PSYCHOBIOL,Dev.
