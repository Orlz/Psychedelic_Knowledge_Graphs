    "PubMed is a database of medical research articles collected by The US National Library of Medicine in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health. The database is built upon the Entrez system of information retrieval and holds titles, authors, and absracts of millions of research articles. PubMed also has an open-access domain named 'PubMed Central', where articles with licenses which adhere to open-science principles are stored. The PDFs of such articles are freely available and can be scraped using the Entrez API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the complex nature of research publishing and licenses, the API is not overly effective and often needs complimented by the manual scraping of articles. This became the case for 40% of the articles in this project as it was not absracts that were being used but instead the discussions and conclusions.  "

      "          \"Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.\",\n",

The chapter then explores the empirical literature on experiences with classic hallucinogens in which claims about mystical or religious experiences have been made. A psychometrically validated questionnaire is described for the reliable measurement of mystical-type experiences occasioned by classic hallucinogens. Controlled laboratory studies show that under double-blind conditions that provide significant controls for expectancy bias, psilocybin can occasion complete mystical experiences in the majority of people studied. These effects are dose-dependent, specific to psilocybin compared to placebo or a psychoactive control substance, and have enduring impact on the moods, attitudes, and behaviors of participants as assessed by self-report of participants and ratings by community observers. Other studies suggest that enduring personal meaning in healthy volunteers and therapeutic outcomes in patients, including reduction and cessation of substance abuse behaviors and reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, are related to the occurrence of mystical experiences during drug sessions. The final sections of the chapter draw parallels in human neuroscience research between the neural bases of experiences with classic hallucinogens and the neural bases of meditative practices for which claims of mystical-type experience are sometimes made. From these parallels, a functional neural model of mystical experience is proposed, based on changes in the default mode network of the brain that have been observed after the administration of classic hallucinogens and during meditation practices for which mystical-type claims have been made.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Reports of mystical-type experiences date back many centuries (e.g. in the case of Rumi or St. Teresa of Avila), if not millennia (i.e. in the case of Plotinus). Mystical experiences have occurred in the course of structured spiritual or religious practices as well as in cases in which there was no direct intention to have such an experience. Mystical experiences are uniquely interesting and important to study because they are sometimes associated with abrupt, substantial, and sustained changes in behavior and perception. Furthermore, the authoritative sense of interconnectedness and sacredness that defines such experiences suggest that mystical experiences may be foundational to the world’s ethical and moral systems. Despite their apparent importance, the unpredictability and low probability of “naturally occurring” mystical-type experiences, whether they occur in religious or non-religious contexts, has made them inherently difficult to study in controlled empirical research.',\n",

       "     'text': 'While there are countless reports of profound spiritual and mystical experiences that have occurred in the absence of psychoactive substances, historical evidence abounds for the role of psychoactive substances in ceremonial approaches to facilitating such experiences. Further, descriptions of naturally occurring mystical experiences are strikingly similar to profound spiritual experiences occasioned by hallucinogenic substances. Experimental investigations have begun to utilize classic hallucinogens to study the reliability, characteristics, subjective nature, and behavioral consequences of mystical-type experiences. Classic hallucinogens are a structurally diverse group of compounds that bind at 5-HT2A serotonin receptors and produce a unique profile of changes in thoughts, emotions, and perceptions, often including profound alterations in the perception of reality, that are rarely experienced except in dreams, naturally occurring mystical experiences, and acute psychosis. The use of classic hallucinogens makes the study of mystical experiences more tractable because classic hallucinogens can be administered under double-blind conditions and can occasion mystical experiences with high probability. Classic hallucinogens allow for prospective and controlled exploration of such experiences, and provide a degree of neurobiological specificity and mechanistic understanding that is not possible in correlational or descriptive studies, or in reviews of present-day or historical case reports.',\n",

The chapter ends with an exposition of a functional neural model of mystical experience that is based on changes in the default mode network of the brain that have been observed after the administration of classic hallucinogens and during meditation practices which are sometimes associated with mystical-type experiences.',\n",

       "     'text': 'The theological and philosophical literatures have primarily taken descriptions of experiences as their source data for the exploration of mystical experiences. The theological literature on mystical experiences is based on accounts of prophets, saints, and the practices of mystic sects within religious traditions. Mystic sects exist within all major world religions. These sects are lineages of individuals who have organized around a spiritual practice within their culture and religion, with characteristic lifestyles, teachings, and traditions that instruct the individual and provide a supportive setting for the individual to achieve a deeper connection with the God of their understanding. In this fashion, mystics may be considered “empirical” theologians. Sufism is a mystical sect within the religion of Islam, while Kabbalists explore mysticism in the context of Judaism. Individuals from various religious traditions, including Christian (e.g. Meister Eckhart from the 13th century, St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross from the 16th century), Islamic (e.g. Rumi and Saadi from the 13th century), and Jewish (e.g. Maimonides of the 12th century) traditions, are considered to be mystics. Some Hindu and Buddhist meditation practices that focus on non-dual experiences likely increase the probability of mystical-type experiences.',\n",

Stace identified, collated, and distilled descriptions of mystical experiences from a variety of sources. From this literature, he argued that mystical experiences have a “common core” of phenomenological features that are independent from the interpretation of those experiences. His thesis in this regard was that differences in the descriptions of mystical experiences given by mystics of different faiths amount not to a difference in the core experience, but rather a difference in the interpretational frame through which those experiences are viewed. The idea of a “common core” of mystical experience is consistent with the notion of a “perennial philosophy” in which an “immemorial and universal” substrate underlies all religions and spiritual paths and is reflected in “every religious tradition and in all the principal languages of Asia and Europe”.',\n",

Stace made a distinction between the qualitative nature of unity in extrovertive mystical experiences and the qualitative nature of unity in introvertive mystical experiences. Unity in the extrovertive mystical experience involves recognition of the oneness of all, in which one finds unity at the core of the inner subjectivity or inner reality of all things despite the diversity or apparent individual identity and separation of all things. Unity in the introvertive mystical experience, on the other hand, involves an experience of the complete dissolution of the self, loss of the notion of “I” and loss of all boundaries, such that there is no separation or individual identity. Introvertive mystical experience involves an experience of unity that is otherwise devoid of content, sometimes referred to as “the void”. While both extrovertive and introvertive types are considered experiences of mystical unity, Stace considered extrovertive unity as an “incomplete kind of experience which finds its completion and fulfillment in the introvertive kind of experience”.',\n",

While the precise factor structure of items of the Hood Mysticism Scale may nominally vary between different cultures and different religious backgrounds, the basic concepts that underlie the factor structure of this instrument are reliable and align with Stace’s model. The extrovertive mysticism factor typically includes items related to external unity (unity in diversity) and inner subjectivity. The introvertive mysticism factor typically includes items related to internal unity (contentless unity), ego loss, ineffability, timelessness and spacelessness. The religious interpretation factor typically includes items that measure reverence or sacredness, noetic quality, and positive mood.

Psychoactive plants and fungi for which there is substantive knowledge of ceremonial use include peyote, ayahuasca, and psilocybin mushrooms. While double-blind studies have not rigorously compared the psychoactive effects of these and other classic hallucinogens (including synthetic hallucinogens such as LSD), the alterations in consciousness produced by these compounds are generally considered to be quite similar, putatively because they share a common mechanism of action initiated through agonism at the 5HT2A receptor and likely involving downstream glutamate effects.

Participants in this study were well educated, psychiatrically and medically healthy, had no prior hallucinogen use, and represented a more general sample of the population than those used in the Good Friday experiment.

The study also utilized a stronger control condition (methylphenidate) than the Good Friday experiment (nicotinic acid). Methylphenidate and psilocybin can both induce strong subjective effects with some similarities, and with a reasonably similar time course. Nicotinic acid, in contrast, has a relatively short time course and a profile of subjective effects that is very different from psilocybin.

Ratings of positive behavior, mood, attitude, and social changes associated with the psilocybin session at the 14-month follow-up were not significantly different from those provided two months post-session. Correlation and regression analyses indicated a central role of mystical experience assessed on the session day (but not intensity of psilocybin experience) in predicting the high ratings of spiritual significance and personal meaning assessed at 14 months. Figure 1 illustrates the significant relationship between mystical experience score and follow-up ratings of spiritual significance.',\n",

This study utilized a double-blind placebo-controlled design that assessed the effects of placebo and a range of psilocybin doses on ratings of spiritual significance and meaningfulness of psilocybin sessions, and on the likelihood of complete mystical experience. Participants in this study were well educated, medically and psychiatrically healthy, and most were hallucinogen naïve. Participants received 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg/70 kg of psilocybin in separate sessions in either ascending or descending order, with at least one month between each session and a placebo session randomly placed within the sequence. Participants were not informed of the ascending or descending nature of the dose sequence. 61% of participants met criteria for a “complete” mystical experience during the 20 mg/70 kg session, whereas 67% of participants met criteria for a “complete mystical experience during the 30 mg/70 kg session (Figure 2, “Dose Effects Study”, dark grey bars). Although “complete” mystical experience was coded in the original publication using items from the 7-factor, 43-item MEQ (MEQ43), the above percentages were derived using the psychometrically validated 4-factor, 30-item MEQ (MEQ30). The MEQ30 has been validated in both retrospective accounts of mystical experiences with psilocybin and in prospective, experimental laboratory studies with psilocybin. The criteria for complete mystical experiences in the MEQ30 are a score of at least 60% of the total possible score on each of four factors of the MEQ30.

One month follow-up ratings after the 20 or 30 mg/70 kg sessions did not differ from follow-up ratings 14 months after study completion.

       "     'text': 'A primary tool for the study of mystical experiences with classic hallucinogens is the Mystical Experience Questionnaire. The 43-item Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ43), also known as the Pahnke-Richards Mystical Experience Questionnaire, was comprised of 43 items that were similar, but not identical, to the original item set used by Pahnke in the Good Friday experiment. The MEQ43 was scored into seven scales based on seven descriptive dimensions of mystical experience described by: internal unity, external unity, noetic quality, sacredness, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and a final factor that combined ineffability and paradoxicality scores. Items from a transiency scale used by Pahnke were not included. Thus, the MEQ43 dimensions are theoretically derived, not empirically derived. The MEQ43 was used in the psilocybin vs. methylphenidate comparison study, the psilocybin dose effects study, and the psilocybin smoking cessation study. The factor structure of this instrument was recently evaluated through analysis of retrospective accounts of mystical experiences with psilocybin-containing mushrooms, collected in two internet surveys (n1 = 1602, n2 = 440). Psychometric analysis of the MEQ43 responses provided in these samples yielded a four-factor structure using a subset of 30 of the original 43 items. The four factors of the 30-item MEQ (MEQ30) are: 1. mystical (including items from the previously proposed internal unity, external unity, noetic quality, and sacredness factors); 2. positive mood; 3. transcendence of time and space; and 4. ineffability. The MEQ30 items and factor structure are presented in Figure 4. This factor structure differs from that of the Hood Mysticism Scale, which has three factors: introvertive mysticism (typically including items measuring contentless unity, timelessness, and spacelessness), extrovertive mysticism (typically including items measuring unity in diversity and inner subjectivity), and religious interpretation (typically including items that measure sacredness, noetic quality, positive affect, paradoxicality, and ineffability). Although some items on the Hood Mysticism Scale were shown to load onto different factors in different subject populations, the underlying conceptual framework of the three-factor structure of the items of the Hood Mysticism Scale has been repeatedly replicated. The four factor structure for the MEQ30 was found to fit responses to the MEQ30 items better than two variations of a three-factor model that included the model proposed by Hood.',\n",

MEQ data from the first moderate to high dose session (20 mg/70 kg or greater) for 184 volunteers from a total of 5 psilocybin studies (; Griffiths et al., in press; and an unpublished study in beginning meditators) were pooled and submitted to confirmatory factor analysis. The analysis confirmed the internal validity of the MEQ30 by demonstrating acceptable fit of the four-factor structure of the MEQ30. This analysis also demonstrated the external validity of the instrument by showing that the four factors of the MEQ30 and a higher-level MEQ total score significantly predicted subsequent ratings (from 3 to 8 weeks after psilocybin administration) of the meaningfulness, spiritual significance, impact on well-being, and positive change in behavior attributed to each psilocybin session, while also controlling for rated strength of drug effects. Another recent study suggested a 2-factor solution to the MEQ30, based on ratings (N=158) given by individuals who had just completed an ayahuasca ceremony, however this solution was not validated with either a separate or a large sample (Bouso et al., 2016). The limitations of this study include details of the set and setting as well as the actual dose of dimethyltryptamine consumed in any given instance. Without proper control of these elements of experience or experimental design, and without validation of the 2-factor structure with rigorous methods in separate samples, we must caution readers to treat the 2-factor structure tentatively.',\n",

While MEQ30 scores for those who received LSD were significantly higher than for those in any other experimental condition, rates of complete mystical experience were lower for LSD (12.5%) than for previous reports of mystical experience after methylphenidate (23–33%) or psilocybin (up to 67% for a high dose of psilocybin). It must be noted, however, that the set and setting involved in previous reports of mystical experience with methylphenidate and psilocybin were highly optimized to support the emergence of mystical experience, involving an experimental room modeled after a living room, a continuous musical accompaniment, art on the walls and soft lighting, and continual interpersonal preparation, support and integration of the experience. The set and setting reported for LSD administration was significantly different, occurring in a standard hospital patient room with optional music listening (Liechti, Dolder, & Schmid, 2016).',\n",

Future research is needed to validate the MEQ30 in assessing mystical experiences that occur in experimental and non-experimental contexts in absence of drug administration.

Multiple neural processes in nearly every major cortical and subcortical division of the brain have been reported to be modulated by classic hallucinogens. Obviously, hallucinogen-related changes in these brain areas cannot be taken as absolute markers of mystical experience, since not all experiences with classic hallucinogens are mystical. Substances such as psilocybin are neither necessary nor sufficient for producing such experiences, and 5HT2A receptor agonism may play only an initiatory role in the brain processes that account for or correlate with mystical experiences. Thus, the literature on the neural correlates of classic hallucinogens alone will be insufficient to provide a complete model of the neural basis of mystical experiences.',\n",

       "     'text': 'One approach to exploring the neural basis of mystical experience is to consider brain states produced by other approaches to occasioning mystical experiences, such as meditation practices. Although meditation encompasses a broad range of practices, a few specific practices have been the focus of brain imaging studies. These include focused awareness, open awareness or open monitoring, and non-dual awareness. Focused awareness practice typically involves attentional focus on an explicit object of consciousness (e.g. breath exhalation). In contrast, the intention of an open awareness practice is effortless sustaining of awareness without explicit selection of a discrete object of focus. In both cases, a goal is to cultivate non-attachment to thoughts or distractions that may arise, with the further goal of stabilizing the mind. Such practices may ultimately lead to experiences of unity, with more specific objects of consciousness receding into the background. Non-dual awareness practices are a more subtle and perhaps a more direct technique of cultivating the experience of unity or pure awareness. In these practices, the object of attention is awareness itself or, as some have described it, awareness of awareness. The non-dual or transcendental unitive state that can arise from such practices appears to be descriptively identical to those described in peak mystical experiences, especially in terms of the dissolution of the conventional sense of personhood or the lack of differentiation between the sense of self and other (i.e. mystical unity).',\n",

The “default mode network” (DMN) consists of a number of brain areas in which task-related decreases in activity were reliability identified in early studies of human brain activity using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The pattern of activity that is typically found in the DMN is hypothesized to reflect intrinsic patterns of communication in the brain. Activity in the DMN (also called the “task-negative network”) generally correlates with internally directed attention and is typically negatively correlated with activity in task-positive networks (i.e. networks that support externally directed attention and behavioral response).',\n",

This has been confirmed in multiple large samples of volunteers (N between 180 and 1000), using a variety of analysis techniques (e.g. seed-based connectivity analysis, independent component analysis, graph-theoretic analysis, and clustering-based analysis). The psychological processes ascribed to the MPFC and PCC include various types of self-referential processing including mentalizing (i.e. thinking about your own or others’ thoughts), internal dialogue, self-related judgments, and autobiographical memory retrieval. The process ascribed to the PHC is primarily the coding of episodic memory content, as opposed to semantic memory content which is coded by the perirhinal cortex (Ranganath & Ritchey, 2012). The MPFC and PCC have been implicated in self-recognition and self-awareness in studies using tasks such as recognition of a face as either “you” or “not-you”, tasks requiring the participant to identify adjectives as traits of themselves or others, tasks assessing self-agency, and tasks that test false beliefs and theory of mind. The PHC, and more broadly the hippocampal complex, has been implicated in supporting consciousness (Behrendt, 2013) by supporting the moment-to-moment binding of sensory information into coherent memory representations, including those thought to be related to a sense of self. The PHC is involved in maintaining and recalling memories of self and self-relevant information.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Additional evidence for the breakdown of long-distance communication in the brain comes from studies using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) that demonstrate changes in electro-cortical activity induced by classic hallucinogens. Slow or low-frequency electro-cortical oscillations (e.g. delta: 1–4 Hz; theta: 4–8 Hz, alpha: 8–16Hz) are often shown to coordinate communication of distant neural areas, whereas faster or higher-frequency oscillations (e.g. gamma: 32+ Hz) are often shown to coordinate local synchronization of a small number of neurons within limited populations. An absolute decrease in oscillatory power in all frequency bands was observed in frontal areas using EEG during the administration of ayahuasca, and with MEG during the administration of psilocybin. With ayahuasca, this decrease was accompanied by an increase in the ratio of high to low frequency oscillatory power, suggesting that low-frequency oscillatory power is more strongly decreased than high-frequency oscillatory power. With psilocybin, despite the decrease in power, stimulus-induced high frequency oscillations were preserved. Reduced synchronization of cortical oscillations in the PCC and PHC has been shown to correlate with a measure of spiritual experience during the effects of oral psilocybin (Kometer et al., 2015). Taken together, evidence in BOLD and electro-cortical signals suggest an alteration of long-distance communication in the brain and a relative preservation of local and basic perceptual processing.',\n",

       "     'text': 'A very intriguing parallel between neuroimaging research on meditation and neuroimaging research with classic hallucinogens involves the functional relevance that is attributed to change in the activity of the PCC. The PCC is implicated in “internally directed cognition”, “‘getting caught up in’ one’s experience”, and “ego integrity”. One could argue that activity in the PCC may reflect self-referential processing (i.e. an internal dialogue or chatter) that is quieted by meditation training. This is supported by research demonstrating that mind-wandering is associated with PCC activity. Meditators with many years of experience in mindfulness practice showed decreased activity in the DMN (specifically the MPFC and PCC; Figure 7, “Deactivations During Meditation”) compared to non-meditators when data were collapsed across practices including focused awareness and open monitoring meditations. Subsequent studies used a neuro-feedback paradigm to demonstrate that decreased activity in the PCC correlated with decreased mind-wandering during focused awareness practice. This is generally consistent with observations after intravenous psilocybin administration showing decreased low frequency power and long-range temporal correlations in BOLD data in the PCC and MPFC, substantially decreased effective connectivity in BOLD data between the PCC and MPFC, and decreases in alpha oscillatory power in the PCC correlated with ratings of ego disintegration. Considering all of the findings summarized above, it could be hypothesized that decreased activity and functional connectivity in the PCC and MPFC (medial nodes of the DMN) mediate aspects of the experience of introvertive unity (including decreased self-referential processing and a loss of sense of self) that is a key component of mystical experience, be that occasioned by classic hallucinogens or by meditation.',\n",

These features support efficient communication between nodes in large networks and they are nearly ubiquitous in natural complex systems (including healthy brains). Movement away from this small world architecture (e.g. toward “random graph” architecture, in which each node has equal probability of being connected directly to every other node) would represent a notable departure from typical brain organization. This is consistent with idea that psychedelics induce disintegration and desegregation of functional brain networks (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). The PCC, MPFC, and IPL can be considered connector hubs that support the small-world architecture of the brain; thus, breakdown of long-distance connections between these nodes, or decreased integration and segregation of these nodes of the DMN, that is observed with meditation and classic hallucinogens may be a marker of altered brain state that is consistent with mystical experiences.',\n",

However, with the proper setting, preparation, support, and dose of a classic hallucinogen, mystical experiences are occasioned at high probability. Post-session and follow-up ratings of mystical experience and positive impact of psilocybin session experiences are dose dependent and sustained at follow-up periods ranging from several weeks to 25 years. Hallucinogen-occasioned mystical experiences are pharmacologically specific (i.e. occur at much higher frequency after a high dose of psilocybin than after placebo, low doses of psilocybin, methylphenidate, or nicotinic acid) and not generally due to expectancy (i.e. demonstrated under conditions that obscured the range of drug conditions administered and not shown with placebo or a low dose of psilocybin). Mystical experiences have a clear operational definition, and the positive outcomes associated with mystical experiences have been empirically demonstrated.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Although the most fundamental questions regarding mystical experiences presently evade a reductive neuroscientific explanation, analysis of the biological correlates suggestive of underlying mechanisms of mystical experiences are tractable. We have highlighted an intriguing overlap in neural findings on classic hallucinogens and neural findings on meditative practices that may occasion mystical experiences. More specifically, changes in activity, connectivity, and neural oscillatory processes in regions of the default mode network may underlie dimensions of mystical experience, especially decreased self-referential processing and altered sense of time and space that accompany introvertive mystical experiences. Further research with classic hallucinogens as experimental tools can be expected to provide significant insights into both the neural mechanisms and well as the biological and behavioral consequences of mystical experiences. Such information may have important implications for developing a science of moral and ethical behavior as well as for developing novel therapeutic interventions for producing persisting positive behavioral and psychological changes.',\n",

The 4 factors of the psychometrically validated questionnaire are derived from a total of 30 items that probe 7 dimensions (designated by underlines) of mystical experience that were identified by Stace (1960). The Mystical factor is composed of 15 items probing four dimensions of the Stace model (internal unity, external unity, noetic quality, and sacredness). Positive Mood (6 items), Transcendence of Time and Space (6 items) and Ineffability (3 items) factors correspond to three separate dimensions of the Stace model.',\n",

Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.',\n",

In cancer patients, depression and anxiety have been associated with decreased treatment adherence, prolonged hospitalization, decreased quality of life, and increased suicidality. Depression is an independent risk factor of early death in cancer patients. Antidepressants and, less frequently, benzodiazepines are used to treat depressed mood and anxiety in cancer patients, although evidence suggesting efficacy is limited and conflicting, and benzodiazepines are generally only recommended for short-term use because of side effects and withdrawal. Although psychological approaches have shown only small to medium effects in treating emotional distress and quality of life, with low quality of reporting in many trials, there are several promising interventions utilizing existential orientations to psychotherapy.',\n",

Meetings after sessions generally focused on novel thoughts and feelings that arose during sessions. Session monitors were study staff originally trained by William Richards PhD, a clinical psychologist with extensive experience conducting studies with classic hallucinogens. Monitor education varied from college graduate to PhD. Formal clinical training varied from none to clinical psychologist.

       "     'text': 'Expectancies, on part of both participants and monitors, are believed to play a large role in the qualitative effects of psilocybin-like drugs. Although double-blind methods are usually used to protect against such effects, expectancy is likely to be significantly operative in a standard drug versus placebo design when the drug being evaluated produces highly discriminable effects and participants and staff know the specific drug conditions to be tested. For these reasons, in the present study a low dose of psilocybin was compared with a high dose of psilocybin, and participants and monitors were given instructions that obscured the actual dose conditions to be tested. Specifically, they were told that psilocybin would be administered in both sessions, the psilocybin doses administered in the two sessions might range anywhere from very low to high, the doses in the two sessions might or might not be the same, sensitivity to psilocybin dose varies widely across individuals, and that at least one dose would be moderate to high. Participants and monitors were further strongly encouraged to try to attain maximal therapeutic and personal benefit from each session.',\n",

When this study was designed, we had little past experience with a range of psilocybin doses. We decreased the high dose from 30 to 22 mg/70 kg after two of the first three participants who received a high dose of 30 mg/70 kg were discontinued from the study (one from vomiting shortly after capsule administration and one for personal reasons). Related to this decision, preliminary data from a dose-effect study in healthy participants suggested that rates of psychologically challenging experiences were substantially greater at 30 than at 20 mg/70 kg. The low dose of psilocybin was decreased from 3 to 1 mg/70 kg after 12 participants because data from the same dose-effect study showed significant psilocybin effects at 5 mg/70 kg, which raised concern that 3 mg/70 kg might not serve as an inactive placebo.',\n",

The interviewer provided no information to the rater about the participant or the nature of the research study. The structured interview (Community Observer Questionnaire) consisted of asking the rater to rate the participant’s behavior and attitudes using a 10-point scale (from 1 = not at all, to 10 = extremely) on 13 items reflecting healthy psychosocial functioning: inner peace; patience; good-natured humor/playfulness; mental flexibility; optimism; anxiety (scored negatively); interpersonal perceptiveness and caring; negative expression of anger (scored negatively); compassion/social concern; expression of positive emotions (e.g. joy, love, appreciation); self-confidence; forgiveness of others; and forgiveness of self. On the first rating occasion, which occurred soon after acceptance into the study, raters were instructed to base their ratings on observations of and conversations with the participant over the past 3 months. On two subsequent assessments, raters were told their previous ratings and were instructed to rate the participant based on interactions over the last month (post-session 2 assessment) or since beginning in the study (6-month follow-up). Data from each interview with each rater were calculated as a total score. Changes in each participant’s behavior and attitudes after drug sessions were expressed as a mean change score (i.e. difference score) from the baseline rating across the raters. Of 438 scheduled ratings by community observers, 25 (<6%) were missed due to failure to return calls or to the rater not having contact with the participant over the rating period.',\n",

In this study, an episode of elevated systolic blood pressure (>160 mm Hg at one or more time-point) occurred in 34% of participants in the high-dose session and 17% of participants in the low-dose session. An episode of elevated diastolic blood pressure (>100 mm Hg at one or more time-point) occurred in 13% of participants in the high-dose session and 2% of participants in the low-dose session. None of these episodes met criteria for medical intervention. Nausea or vomiting occurred in 15% of participants in the high-dose session and none in the low-dose session. An episode of physical discomfort (any type) occurred in 21% of participants in the high-dose session and 8% in the low-dose session.

Figure 5 shows some of these effects. To further examine the contribution of mystical experience to these outcome measures, partial correlations were conducted to control for the participant-rated intensity of drug effect, which, like mystical experience, was assessed at the end of the session. This analysis continued to show significant effects of mystical experience on 11 of these 18 measures (meaningfulness, spiritual significance, life satisfaction, GRID-HAMD, HADS Depression, HADS Total, HADS Anxiety, HAM-A, BSI, MQOL-meaningful existence and LAP-R Coherence).

Point estimates and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals for the indirect effects of the mediation analysis were: meaningfulness (1.43 [0.72–2.44]), spiritual significance (1.19 [0.59–2.10]), life satisfaction (0.60 [0.218–1.19]), HADS Anxiety (−1.50 [−3.50 to −0.33]), HADS Depression (−1.11 [−2.79 to −0.02]), HADS Total (−2.62 [−5.74 to −0.72]), and HAM-A (−3.93 [−7.88 to −1.52]).',\n",

Eleven of 17 therapeutically relevant measures fulfilled conservative criteria for demonstrating efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin (Table 4, Figure 3). The data show that psilocybin produced large and significant decreases in clinician-rated and self-rated measures of depression, anxiety or mood disturbance, and increases in measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and optimism. These effects were sustained at 6 months. For the clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety, respectively, the overall rate of clinical response at 6 months was 78% and 83% and the overall rate of symptom remission was 65% and 57%. Participants attributed to the high-dose experience positive changes in attitudes about life, self, mood, relationships and spirituality, with over 80% endorsing moderately or higher increased well-being or life satisfaction.

Evidence of some success of this blinding was provided in a post-study questionnaire completed by staff and by significant treatment effects observed after Session 1 in participants who received the very low dose of psilocybin. Although it was assumed that 1 mg/70 kg would be largely pharmacologically inactive, some pharmacological activity of this dose cannot be ruled out entirely. Thus, it might have been preferable to use an even lower dose of psilocybin (e.g. 0.01 mg/70 kg) to assure pharmacological inactivity while maintaining the benefit of the instruction that psilocybin would be administered on each session. Although the low-dose comparison condition and instructions to participants and staff facilitated blinding and minimized expectancy effects, it should be noted that these experimental design features may be difficult to implement in research settings that require complete disclosure of specific study conditions or arms.',\n",

As in previous research, the study documented enduring increases in positive changes in attitudes and mood on both the participant-rated Persisting Effects Questionnaire and on the Community Observer Questionnaire. However, neither of these measures has been independently validated. Likewise, although the finding of significant decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms on both participant-rated and clinician-rated measures is a strength, the inclusion of blinded clinician ratings would further strengthen the study.

Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.', 'sentences': [], 'annotations': [], 'relations': []}, {'offset': 1714, 'infons': {'section_type': 'ABSTRACT', 'type': 'abstract'}, 'text': ' Trial Registration ', 'sentences': [], 'annotations': [], 'relations': []}, {'offset': 1735, 'infons': {'section_type': 'ABSTRACT', 'type': 'abstract'}, 'text': 'ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00465595', 'sentences': [], 'annotations': [], 'relations': []}, {'offset': 1778, 'infons': {'section_type': 'INTRO', 'type': 'title_1'}, 'text': 'Introduction', 'sentences': [], 'annotations': [], 'relations': []}, {'offset': 1791, 'infons': {'section_type': 'INTRO', 'type': 'paragraph'}, 'text': 'Cancer patients often develop a chronic, clinically significant syndrome of psychosocial distress having depressed mood, anxiety, and reduced quality of life as core features, with up to 40% of cancer patients meeting criteria for a mood disorder. In cancer patients, depression and anxiety have been associated with decreased treatment adherence, prolonged hospitalization, decreased quality of life, and increased suicidality. Depression is an independent risk factor of early death in cancer patients. Antidepressants and, less frequently, benzodiazepines are used to treat depressed mood and anxiety in cancer patients, although evidence suggesting efficacy is limited and conflicting, and benzodiazepines are generally only recommended for short-term use because of side effects and withdrawal.

Meetings after sessions generally focused on novel thoughts and feelings that arose during sessions. Session monitors were study staff originally trained by William Richards PhD, a clinical psychologist with extensive experience conducting studies with classic hallucinogens. Monitor education varied from college graduate to PhD. Formal clinical training varied from none to clinical psychologist.

For these reasons, in the present study a low dose of psilocybin was compared with a high dose of psilocybin, and participants and monitors were given instructions that obscured the actual dose conditions to be tested. Specifically, they were told that psilocybin would be administered in both sessions, the psilocybin doses administered in the two sessions might range anywhere from very low to high, the doses in the two sessions might or might not be the same, sensitivity to psilocybin dose varies widely across individuals, and that at least one dose would be moderate to high.

Thus, it might have been preferable to use an even lower dose of psilocybin (e.g. 0.01 mg/70 kg) to assure pharmacological inactivity while maintaining the benefit of the instruction that psilocybin would be administered on each session.
