1,10.1177/0269881116675513,"The present study demonstrated the efficacy of a high dose of psilocybin administered under supportive conditions to decrease symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety, and to increase quality of life in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. Eleven of 17 therapeutically relevant measures fulfilled conservative criteria for demonstrating efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin (Table 4, Figure 3). The data show that psilocybin produced large and significant decreases in clinician-rated and self-rated measures of depression, anxiety or mood disturbance, and increases in measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and optimism. These effects were sustained at 6 months. For the clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety, respectively, the overall rate of clinical response at 6 months was 78% and 83% and the overall rate of symptom remission was 65% and 57%. Participants attributed to the high-dose experience positive changes in attitudes about life, self, mood, relationships and spirituality, with over 80% endorsing moderately or higher increased well-being or life satisfaction. These positive effects were reflected in significant corresponding changes in ratings by community observers (friends, family, work colleagues) of participant attitudes and behavior.The results substantially extend the findings of a recent double-blind pilot study with a lower dose of psilocybin (14 mg/70 kg) in cancer patients that showed non-significant trends for benefits of psilocybin compared with placebo (niacin) on measures of depression and anxiety, with some significant decreases relative to baseline demonstrated at 1 to 6 months (Grob et al., 2011). The time-course, magnitude, and qualitative features of the high dose of psilocybin on session days were consistent with those observed in previous studies in healthy volunteers (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2011; Johnson et al., 2012).The significant association of mystical-type experience (MEQ30) during Session 1 with most of the enduring changes in therapeutic outcome measures 5 weeks later (Figure 5) is consistent with previous findings showing that such experiences on session days predict long-term positive changes in attitudes, mood, behavior, and spirituality (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2008, 2011). For most measures, this relationship continued to be significant when the intensity of overall psilocybin effect was controlled in a partial correlation analysis. This suggests that mystical-type experience per se has an important role apart from overall intensity of drug effect. Finally, a mediation analysis further suggested that mystical-type experience has a mediating role in positive therapeutic response.The observed decreases in psychological distress and anxiety about death may relate to recent epidemiological findings that lifetime psilocybin use was associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress and suicidality (Hendricks et al., 2015).An innovative feature of the study design was that participants and staff monitors were given instructions that obscured the actual psilocybin dose conditions to facilitate blinding and minimize expectancy effects, which are believed to be a significant determinant of classic hallucinogen effects (Griffiths et al., 2006; Metzner et al., 1965). Evidence of some success of this blinding was provided in a post-study questionnaire completed by staff and by significant treatment effects observed after Session 1 in participants who received the very low dose of psilocybin. Although it was assumed that 1 mg/70 kg would be largely pharmacologically inactive, some pharmacological activity of this dose cannot be ruled out entirely. Thus, it might have been preferable to use an even lower dose of psilocybin (e.g. 0.01 mg/70 kg) to assure pharmacological inactivity while maintaining the benefit of the instruction that psilocybin would be administered on each session. Although the low-dose comparison condition and instructions to participants and staff facilitated blinding and minimized expectancy effects, it should be noted that these experimental design features may be difficult to implement in research settings that require complete disclosure of specific study conditions or arms.Several additional experimental limitations should be noted. Participants were crossed over to the alternative dose condition after 5 weeks. Although this allowed assessment of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin in all study participants, it precluded double-blind assessment of efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin based on across group comparisons after 5 weeks. As in previous research, the study documented enduring increases in positive changes in attitudes and mood on both the participant-rated Persisting Effects Questionnaire and on the Community Observer Questionnaire . However, neither of these measures has been independently validated. Likewise, although the finding of significant decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms on both participant-rated and clinician-rated measures is a strength, the inclusion of blinded clinician ratings would further strengthen the study. The relatively small sample (n = 51) that was highly educated and predominately White limits the generality of conclusions.Finally, it is important to note that the overall approach of treating cancer-related psychological distress with psilocybin is limited by a variety of exclusion criteria (see online Supplementary material) and by the significant time and cost of professional support provided before, during, and after the psilocybin session. Patients may also be reluctant to participate in such an intervention because high doses of psilocybin have sometimes been associated with transient episodes of psychological distress or anxiety in patients.The neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of psilocybin therapeutic effects remain speculative As a 5-HT2A agonist, the psilocybin metabolite psilocin directly and indirectly affects various brain cortical and subcortical areas and alters brain network dynamics Precisely how the enduring therapeutically relevant psilocybin effects are reflected in long-term alteration of cortical networks or other neuroplastic changes remains to be established.","When administered under psychologically supportive, double-blind conditions, a single dose of psilocybin produced substantial and enduring decreases in depressed mood and anxiety along with increases in quality of life and decreases in death anxiety in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. Ratings by patients themselves, clinicians, and community observers suggested these effects endured at least 6 months. The overall rate of clinical response at 6 months on clinician-rated depression and anxiety was 78% and 83%, respectively. A multisite study in a larger and more diverse patient population should be conducted to establish the generality and safety of psilocybin treatment of psychological distress associated with life-threatening cancer."
2,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.116,"The initial goals of this research project were to establish feasibility and safety for a hallucinogen treatment model in patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Following discussion with federal and state regulatory agencies as well as hospital institutional review board and research committees, a modest 0.2-mg/kg psilocybin dose was chosen. Although not comparable to higher doses of hallucinogens administered in the past to severely ill patients, the dose used here was still believed capable of inducing an alteration of consciousness with potential therapeutic benefit while optimizing patient safety. Determining safe parameters with this novel treatment paradigm is critical to establishing a strong foundation for this field of study that would allow for future investigations. Consistent with previous research, we found no untoward cardiovascular sequelae in our subject population.19 Minor HR and BP elevations after psilocybin administration were evidence only of a mild sympathomimetic effect. Holter monitoring did not identify increased cardiac arrhythmias in comparison with niacin placebo, even in subjects who presented with some baseline cardiac arrhythmia. Niacin may acutely lower BP through vasodilation35 but had minimal effects on BP and HR in our subjects, except for a reduction in diastolic BP that was noted 1 hour after administration of niacin. This transient effect may have contributed to our detection of a significant psilocybin effect at that time but cannot explain the significant effects of psilocybin over the subsequent intervals because the initial niacin-induced reduction of diastolic BP did not persist. We also observed no adverse psychological effects from the treatment. All subjects tolerated the treatment sessions well, with no indication of severe anxiety or a “bad trip.” The fact that psilocybin produced only modest effects on the anxious ego dissolution scale of the 5D-ASC confirmed this conclusion. When hallucinogens were administered to patients with terminal cancer in the 1960s and early 1970s, the occurrence of a profound psychospiritual experience was correlated with therapeutic outcome.10,12 Such transcendent states of consciousness are usually associated with higher doses of hallucinogens, so our expectation of demonstrating efficacy was limited.21 Common themes reported by subjects included examining how their illness had impacted their lives, relationships with family and close friends, and sense of ontological security. In addition, subjects reported powerful empathic cathexis to close friends and family members and examined how they wished to address their limited life expectancy. In monthly follow-up discussions, subjects reflected on insights and new perspectives gained during their psilocybin treatment. However, the frequency of these reports was not quantified. Although past researchers reported more pronounced therapeutic effects with a higher-dose model, even the lower dose of psilocybin used in the current study gave some indication of therapeutic benefit in quantitative psychological evaluations. In particular, we found that the STAI trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a sustained reduction in anxiety that reached significance at the 1- and 3-month points after treatment. This reduction might reflect a reduced level of stress and anxiety over time. Although the state anxiety on the STAI showed a modest elevation at 6 months, the change was not statistically significant and might have resulted from the deteriorating medical status of most subjects over time. Mood also improved for 2 weeks after treatment with psilocybin, with sustained improvement on the BDI reaching significance at the 6-month follow-up point. The POMS scores also reflected improved mood 2 weeks after receiving psilocybin. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward positive outcome. With a larger cohort of subjects and use of a higher dose of psilocybin, it seems possible that significant results would be obtained on these measures. Compared with placebo sessions, POMS scores were elevated in subjects immediately prior to psilocybin administration. The reasons for this difference in POMS scores 1 day before administration are not entirely clear. Subject expectations were unlikely to have played a role in the elevation of the POMS scores on the day before treatment because the elevation occurred regardless of treatment order. The most likely explanation for the elevation of POMS scores prior to treatment with psilocybin may be that subject randomization was not complete with regard to this instrument. Nonetheless, POMS scores declined after administration of psilocybin in 11 of 12 subjects, suggesting that psilocybin produces mood-elevating effects that persist after the acute effects of the drug. Another focus of the study was the effect of a 0.2-mg/kg psilocybin dose on somatic symptoms, particularly pain perception. In contrast to previous investigations, we did not find robust reductions in pain perception or lessened need for narcotic pain medication. In the 2 weeks following experimental treatment sessions, several subjects reported lessened pain, whereas others did not. There was no apparent difference between subjects treated with psilocybin and those treated with placebo (data not shown). Although this modest dose of psilocybin was not observed to impact pain, given the impressive reports of earlier researchers,6 this measure would certainly be indicated for study with higher doses. Although we used a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the drug order was almost always apparent to subjects and investigators whether the treatment was psilocybin or placebo. In fact, one consistent subject critique of the study was that the placebo sessions were perceived as far less worthwhile than those with psilocybin. Many of the subjects suggested that future protocols provide the opportunity for a second psilocybin session several weeks after the first. The general consensus among subjects was that a follow-up experience with psilocybin would reinforce and extend the perceived therapeutic effects of the initial session. Future studies also will need to address the issue of controlling for a placebo effect that might otherwise be attributed to the active treatment. Given the subjects' grave prognosis and limited life expectancy, we decided to provide all subjects with an opportunity to experience the experimental medicine and to serve as their own control. Although we believed that to be the ethical course to take, given the life circumstances subjects were encountering, the protocol design contains some inherent limitations. A better experimental design might incorporate an independent control group, receiving only either placebo treatment or a conventional psychopharmacological intervention. Although there is no question that the extensive attention paid to the subjects influenced outcomes, the unique qualities of the psilocybin experience in facilitating strong therapeutic bonds and ameliorating underlying psychological demoralization are important factors worthy of further exploration. Another limitation of this study was variability in the extent of contact with subjects after treatment. A minimum contact of 1 hour monthly was established, but variability in additional ad hoc communication depended on the needs and wishes of the subjects, some of whom were near death compared with others who were more functional. Despite the limitations, this study demonstrates that the careful and controlled use of psilocybin may provide an alternative model for the treatment of conditions that are often minimally responsive to conventional therapies, including the profound existential anxiety and despair that often accompany advanced-stage cancers. A recent review from the psilocybin research group at Johns Hopkins University describes the critical components necessary for ensuring subject safety in hallucinogen research.36 Taking into account these essential provisions for optimizing safety as well as adhering to strict ethical standards of conduct for treatment facilitators, the results provided herein indicate the safety and promise of continued investigations into the range of medical effects of hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin.",
3,10.1124/pr.115.011478,"Dr. Albert Hofmann, the natural products chemist who accidently discovered the effects of LSD in 1943 while working at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland, wrote an autobiographical account of his discovery titled LSD: My Problem Child (Hofmann, 1979b). In his book, Hofmann talks about the potential of LSD, which he had hoped would be a promising new tool for psychiatry, but also expresses dismay at the social turbulence that ensued when “LSD was swept up in the huge wave of an inebriant mania that began to spread over the Western world, above all the United States…” (Hofmann, 1979b). Hofmann died in 2008 at the age of 102 years; but in his later years, he was delighted to see that real science had begun to take a thorough approach to unraveling the psychopharmacological mysteries of LSD, which he had always believed would eventually prove to be a miracle drug for psychiatry.With that in mind, if the positive therapeutic effects of psychedelics continue to be validated by additional well designed clinical studies, it opens up a whole new dimension of medical research. If psilocybin or LSD can acutely abolish depression or anxiety after one or only a few treatments, the question must be asked, “How does that occur?” There are many who believe that such improvement must be related to neurochemical effects, or neuroadaptation, and refuse to believe that the mystical experience may be relevant. Yet both modern and older studies consistently find that those who experience the most profound mystical experiences invariably receive the greatest symptom improvement. Of course, as reductionists, it is understood that the mystical experience must have neurochemical correlates. Even so, understanding what they are, how and why they occur, and how they lead to therapeutic improvement should shed light on the underlying deficits in brain function that lead to these disorders in the first place. Before-and-after brain imaging studies of patients with depression, anxiety, or addictive disorders will show how brain connectivity has changed as a result of psychedelic treatment. To understand these disorders at the present time with standard state-of-the-art approaches involves a sort of “fishing expedition,” searching for biomarkers that might be clues to the basis of the underlying disorder. Genome-wide association studies plow through many thousands or hundreds of thousands of genes, searching for candidates that might be the underlying causes of affective disorders. One generally cannot do prospective studies, to compare the brain function of the normal patient prior to the onset of his or her disease, and then examine it again after therapeutic improvement. Rather, one begins with a patient who is already sick, and then if therapeutic improvement occurs, usually over a long period of time, one tries to understand how it happened. By contrast, some of the recent treatments of anxiety and depression with psilocybin or LSD are so dramatic, and happen so quickly, that there must be some overt measureable changes in brain function or connectivity that correlate with therapeutic improvement. Learning what these are is the next big challenge, a process that promises to completely revolutionize the way we approach discovering better treatments for a host of human psychiatric disorders.Considering the most recent scientific and clinical developments in understanding the actions of psychedelics, a statement made in 1980 by Dr. Stanislav Grof seems particularly relevant today: “It does not seem to be an exaggeration to say that psychedelics, used responsibly and with proper caution, would be for psychiatry what the microscope is for biology and medicine or the telescope is for astronomy. These tools make it possible to study important processes that under normal circumstances are not available for direct observation” (Grof, 1980).",
4,10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30065-7,"In this open-label, single-arm pilot study, we sought to examine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to patients with treatment-resistant depression as a prelude to a larger randomised controlled trial. Our results support the view that, done with appropriate safeguards (eg, careful screening and adequate therapeutic support), psilocybin can be safely administered to this patient group.Because this was a small-scale feasibility study with an open-label design, strong inferences cannot be made about the treatment's therapeutic efficacy. However, the data do suggest that further research is warranted. The response rate to psilocybin was 67% (n=8) at 1 week after treatment (HAM-D and BDI), and seven of these eight patients also met criteria for remission. Moreover, 58% (n=7) of the patients maintained their response for 3 months, and 42% (n=5) remained in remission. It is also worth noting that psilocybin has a favourable toxicity profile and is not associated with compulsive drug-seeking behaviours in animals or human beings. The side-effects that we noted were minor, and expected in light of previous studies of psilocybin.Spontaneous recovery in refractory depression is rare, and many of the patients in the present study reported having depression for much of their adult lives (mean estimated illness duration 17·8 years [SD 8]). Key questions for future research therefore should address why the therapeutic effect observed in the present study is so large, and if it can be replicated when tighter experimental controls are introduced. Because the treatment in our study consisted of not just two psilocybin administrations but also psychological support before, during, and after these sessions, as well as a positive therapeutic environment for the sessions, the relative effects of these factors need to be determined, which can only be done by conducting further trials with appropriate control conditions. A logical next step would be to carry out a placebo-controlled randomised trial in which the level of therapist contact is consistent between conditions. This would enable any between-group differences in clinical outcomes to be attributed to psilocybin rather than the psychological support provided. However, a positive interaction between these variables seems likely, and inert placebo-based blinds are known to be ineffective in studies involving conspicuous experimental interventions, because patients can easily discern whether they are in the active condition or not. Use of an active placebo for the control condition might therefore be worth considering. Additionally, randomised comparative efficacy trials (eg, with an optional crossover component) incorporating another treatment for refractory depression (eg, ketamine infusion) could also be explored. The magnitude and persistence of the antidepressant effects observed here are not incongruent with what has been observed previously with psilocybin in chronic psychiatric conditions. For example, 80% of long-term heavy tobacco smokers demonstrated abstinence from smoking 6 months after two treatment sessions with psilocybin. 18 Alcohol-dependent patients demonstrated significantly reduced drinking behaviours over 8 months after one or two psilocybin sessions. 19 Significantly decreased anxiety and depression scores were observed 3 and 6 months after a single dose of psilocybin in patients with anxiety related to end-stage cancer, 15 and improvements in wellbeing lasting for more than 1 year were observed in healthy individuals given a single dose of psilocybin. 8 Rapid and enduring decreases in depressive symptoms were also recently found in a small-scale feasibility trial involving the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca. It is important to consider the limitations of this pilot study; for example, although all patients showed some clinical improvements for at least 3 weeks after treatment, and no serious or unexpected adverse reactions were observed, enduring improvements beyond 3 weeks were not observed universally, and five of the 12 patients showed a degree of relapse at 3 months. One should be cautious of the potential for inflated effect sizes in early trials, particularly when the sample size is small. That all patients showed some improvement in their depressive symptoms for up to 3 weeks after treatment could be suggestive of an expectancy bias. It may also be relevant that most patients in this trial were self-referring and, thus, actively sought this treatment. Psychedelics are known to promote suggestibility, 28 which might have further enhanced positive outcomes. Future double-blind randomised controlled trials could address the role of expectancy and suggestibility by measuring and controlling these variables. For example, patients could be asked about their pre-treatment expectations, suggestions could be controlled between conditions, and outcomes from self-referred patients could be compared with those from patients referred via clinicians. From a more pragmatic perspective, if expectancy or suggestibility are found to be influential in the context of psychedelic therapy, they could be treated as exploitable components of the treatment model rather than confounding variables. Serotonergic antidepressants have been found to down-regulate the primary receptor target of psilocybin (the 5-HT 2A receptor) and attenuated subjective responses to psychedelics have previously been reported in individuals chronically medicated with serotonergic antidepressants. 29 Thus, patients may be required to withdraw from concurrent antidepressant medication before receiving psilocybin and this should only ever be done with care. In conclusion, we sought to assess the safety and tolerability of psilocybin plus psychological support in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. Our findings support the feasibility of this approach and the magnitude and duration of the post-treatment reductions in symptom severity motivate further controlled research. Psilocybin has a novel pharmacological action in comparison with currently available treatments for depression (ie, 5-HT 2A receptor agonism) and thus could constitute a useful addition to available therapies for the treatment of depression.",
5,10.1073/pnas.1119598109,"The fMRI studies reported here revealed significant and consistent outcomes. Psilocybin significantly decreased brain blood flow and venous oxygenation in a manner that correlated with its subjective effects, and significantly decreased the positive coupling of two key structural hubs (the mPFC and the PCC). Our use of fMRI to measure resting-state brain activity after a psychedelic is unique, and because the results are unexpected, they require some explanation. The effect of psilocybin on resting-state brain activity has been measured before with PET and glucose metabolism (8). This study found a global increase in glucose metabolism after oral psilocybin, which is inconsistent with our fMRI results. One possible explanation for this discrepancy relates to the fact that the radiotracer used to measure glucose metabolism (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) has a long half-life (110 min). Thus, the effects of psilocybin, as measured by PET, are over much greater timescales than indexed by our fMRI measures. It is therefore possible that phasic or short-term effects of psilocybin show some rebound that is detected by longer-term changes in glucose metabolism. More direct measures of neural activity will help inform this hypothesis, but in support of the inference that psilocybin does decrease neural activity, direct recordings of cortical local field potentials (LFPs) in rats found broadband decreases in resting state LFP power after psilocybin infusion—including γ-power (9)—changes in which are known to correlate with changes in the BOLD signal (10). It has been commonly assumed that psychedelics work by increasing neural activity; however, our results put this into question. Psilocin is a mixed serotonin receptor agonist, but there is a general consensus that the characteristic subjective and behavioral effects of psychedelics are initiated via stimulation of serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 2A receptors (11). It is possible that the deactivations observed in the present studies were caused by stimulation of 5-HT receptors other than 5-HT2A; however, this seems unlikely given that the affinity of psychedelics for the 5-HT2A receptor correlates with their potency (12) and 5-HT2A antagonists block the subjective effects of psychedelics (13). There is a large body of preclinical evidence that stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors increases GABAergic transmission and pyramidal cell inhibition (14–21), which may explain the deactivations observed here (Figs. 2 and 4). fMRI studies with serotonergic compounds that stimulate other 5-HT receptors, such as the 5-HT2C (22) or (mainly) the 5-HT1A receptor (23), have not found comparable results to those shown here, and 5-HT2A receptors are present in high concentrations in the cortical regions that were significantly deactivated and decoupled after psilocybin (Table S2). Stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor increases excitation in the host cell by reducing outward potassium currents (24). Thus, if the 5-HT2A receptor did mediate the observed deactivations, then it may have been via 5-HT2A-induced excitation of fast-spiking interneurons terminating on pyramidal cells (e.g., ref. 24) or 5-HT2A-induced excitation of pyramidal cells projecting onto interneurons (25). Regardless of how these effects were initiated at the receptor level, it is necessary for us to offer a functional explanation for them. It is noteworthy that the regions which showed the most consistent deactivations after psilocybin (e.g., the PCC and mPFC) are also those that show disproportionately high activity under normal conditions (26). For example, metabolism in the PCC is ∼20% higher than most other brain regions (27), yet psilocybin decreased its blood flow by up to 20% in some subjects. There is some mystery about the function of the PCC; its large size, buffered location, and rich vasculature means that it is well protected from damage. The high metabolic activity of the PCC and the default-mode network (DMN) with which is it associated (26) has led some to speculate about its functional importance, positing a role in consciousness (28) and high-level constructs, such as the self (29) or “ego” (30, 31). Indeed, the DMN is known to be activated during self-referencing (28) and other high-level functions linked to the self-construct (27). Moreover, DMN regions are also known to host the highest number of cortico-cortical connections in the brain, making them important “connector hubs” (32). These hubs may be critical for efficient information transfer in the brain by allowing communication between different regions via the fewest number of connections (33). However, such an integrative function would confer a significant responsibility on these regions, which may explain why their deactivation has such a profound effect on consciousness, as shown here. These results may have implications beyond explaining how psilocybin works in the brain by implying that the DMN is crucial for the maintenance of cognitive integration and constraint under normal conditions. This finding is consistent with Aldous Huxley's “reducing valve” metaphor (34) and Karl Friston's “free-energy principle” (35), which propose that the mind/brain works to constrain its experience of the world. The pharmaco-physiological interaction results were particularly intriguing, revealing significant decreases in the positive coupling between the PCC and mPFC after psilocybin. This result can be understood in terms of a regression of PCC activity on mPFC activity, in which the regression slope decreases. This finding can either be interpreted as a decrease in the (backward or top-down) connectivity from prefrontal to parietal regions or, equivalently, an increase in the reciprocal (forward or bottom-up) direction from parietal to prefrontal regions. This asymmetrical change in coupling, induced by psilocybin, is consistent with a reduction in the sensitivity of superficial pyramidal cells in the parietal region targeted by prefrontal afferents, which may or may not be associated with a compensatory increase in the influence of parietal regions on prefrontal activity. Whatever the underlying synaptic mechanisms, these results provide clear evidence for a perturbation in reciprocal coupling between these two association areas and speak to a rebalancing of hierarchical activity in distributed high-level modes. Finally, consistent with their history of use as adjuncts to psychotherapy, the idea has recently re-emerged that psychedelics may be useful in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders (36). It seems relevant therefore that activity in (37) and connectivity with (38) the mPFC is known to be elevated in depression and normalized after effective treatment (39). The mPFC was consistently deactivated by psilocybin (Fig. 4) and the magnitude of the deactivations correlated with the drug's subjective effects (Fig. 3). Depression has been characterized as an “overstable” state, in which cognition is rigidly pessimistic (39). Trait pessimism has been linked to deficient 5-HT2A receptor stimulation (40, 41), particularly in the mPFC (40), and mPFC hyperactivity has been linked to pathological brooding (42). Recent work has shown that psilocybin can increase subjective well-being (4) and trait openness (43) several months after an acute experience, and depression scores in terminal cancer patients were significantly decreased 6 mo after treatment with psilocybin (2). Our results suggest a biological mechanism for this: decreased mPFC activity via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. Further work is required to test this hypothesis and the putative utility of psilocybin in depression We also observed decreased CBF in the hypothalamus after psilocybin (Fig. 2), which may explain anecdotal reports that psychedelics reduce symptoms of cluster headaches (44). Increased hypothalamic CBF was observed during acute headache in cluster headache sufferers (45) and inhibition of the hypothalamus via direct electrical stimulation can provide therapeutic relief for this condition. To conclude, here we used an advanced and comprehensive fMRI protocol to image the brain effects of psilocybin. These studies offer the most detailed account to date on how the psychedelic state is produced in the brain. The results suggest decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's connector hubs, permitting an unconstrained style of cognition.",
6,10.1177/0269881116675512,"Single moderate-dose psilocybin, in conjunction with psychotherapy, produced rapid, robust, and sustained clinical benefits in terms of reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer. This pharmacological finding is novel in psychiatry in terms of a single dose of a medication leading to immediate anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects with enduring (e.g. weeks to months) clinical benefits. Even though it is not possible to attribute causality of the experimental drug (in terms of sustained clinical benefit) after the crossover, the post-crossover data analyses of the two dosing sequences suggest that the clinical benefits, in terms of reduction of cancer-related anxiety and depression, of single-dose psilocybin (in conjunction with psychotherapy) may be sustained for longer than 7 weeks post-dosing, and that they may endure for as long as 8 months post-psilocybin dosing. The acute and sustained anti-depressant effects of psilocybin in this trial are consistent with a recently published open-label study of oral psilocybin treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in which psilocybin (25 mg) was associated with 1 week and 3 months post-psilocybin anti-depressant effects (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). The within-group analyses for the primary outcome measures demonstrate that immediately after receiving psilocybin there is a marked reduction in anxiety and depression scores for both the psilocybin first and niacin first groups. Also, the magnitude of psilocybin-induced change across each participant’s active psilocybin treatment session did not differ across treatment group for any of the primary outcome measures. Together, this suggests that the pharmacological/psilocybin intervention produced rapid anti-depressant and anxiolytic clinical benefits. Both groups demonstrated significant clinical improvements in anxiety/depression from baseline relative to the final assessment. It is unclear from the data whether the sustained benefits in clinical outcomes were due to psilocybin alone or some interactive effect of psilocybin plus the targeted psychotherapy. Future research would be necessary to separate out the various therapeutic contributions of psilocybin versus psychotherapy. Psilocybin was associated with substantial anti-depressant response rates (as high as approximately 80% at 6.5 months follow-up). There have been several meta-analyses of placebo controlled trials exploring the efficacy of anti-depressants in the treatment of cancer-related depression and they have generally failed to show a clear effect of anti-depressant treatment over placebo (Iovieno et al., 2011; Laoutidis and Mathiak, 2013; Ostuzzi et al., 2015). In a meta-analyses of anti-depressants for major depressive disorder in patients with comorbid medical disorders (including cancer), anti-depressants were more effective than placebo in some medical conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS, post-stroke) but not in cancer patients, where the anti-depressants performed about as well as the approximately 40% placebo response rate (Iovieno et al., 2011) Psilocybin decreased cancer-related demoralization (e.g. loss of meaning/hope/purpose, desire for hastened death) and hopelessness, while improving spiritual wellbeing, general life satisfaction, and quality of life. While a minority of patients with advanced or terminal cancer experience clinically relevant existential/spiritual distress, when it occurs its effects are highly consequential (e.g. decreased quality of life, increased depressive and anxiety symptoms, increased desire for hastened death, increased suicidal ideation and behaviors) (Puchalski, 2012) and improving spiritual wellbeing (e.g. through a pharmacological-psychosocial intervention) could serve as a buffer against these negative clinical outcomes. Although affect/anxiety towards death did not improve in the short-term or longer-term follow-up period, psilocybin was associated with improved attitudes and adaptations to death at the 6.5-month follow-up. More research into this important therapeutic area is warranted. Psilocybin experiences were reported as highly meaningful and spiritual, and associated with positive cognitive, affective, spiritual, and behavioral effects lasting weeks to months. This finding is consistent with prior research administering psilocybin to normal volunteers (Doblin, 1991; Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008, 2011; Pahnke, 1963). There were no serious AEs, either medical or psychiatric, in the trial that were attributed to psilocybin. Since the early 1990s, approximately 2000 doses of psilocybin (ranging from low to high doses) have been safely administered to humans in the United States and Europe, in carefully controlled scientific settings, with no reports of any medical or psychiatric serious AEs, including no reported cases of prolonged psychosis or HPPD (Studerus et al., 2011). This finding is consistent with a US population (2001–2004 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health) based study that found no associations between lifetime use of any of the serotoninergic psychedelics (including psilocybin) and increased rates of mental illness (Krebs and Johansen, 2013). It is important to monitor closely for the emergence of transient difficult psychological states (e.g. anxiety, paranoia) in these trials and to manage them. Difficult experiences are not necessarily pathological and can be understood as part of the therapeutic process (e.g. working through cancer-related psychological or existential distress through challenging encounters or emotionally charged confrontations with cancer-related fearful imagery or symbolism) (Carbonaro et al., 2016).This trial was limited by a relatively small sample size, a non-nationally representative cancer patient population (e.g. 62% women, 90% Caucasian), which decreases generalizability, a crossover design that limited the interpretation of clinical benefits after the crossover, and the use of a control with limited blinding. There is evidence from animal research that serotoninergic psychedelics exert anxiolytic-like effects (Nichols, 2015). Several trials using animal models of anxiety demonstrated acute anxiolytic effects of the serotoninergic psychedelic 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), a non-selective 5-HT2a/2c agonist (Nic Dhonnchadha et al., 2003; Ripoll et al., 2005, 2006). In two rodent studies, one with 5HT2A knockout mice (Weisstaub et al., 2006) and the other in rats with anti-sense-mediated 5HT2A downregulation (Cohen, 2005), the rodents displayed decreased anxiety-like behavior and in the trial with the 5HT2A knockout mice (Weisstaub et al., 2006), restoration of 5HT2A receptors in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) re-established anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, in humans, fronto-limbic 5HT2A density has been correlated with anxiety symptoms (Frokjaer et al., 2008). Together, these data suggest that 5HT2A downregulation may explain some of the rapid and sustained anxiolytic effects of psilocybin (Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). There is growing evidence that the serotoninergic psychedelics produce rapid and sustained anti-depressant effects (Nichols, 2015). In two recently published open-label trials, one using a single dose of ayahuasca (Osorio et al., 2015) and the other using two doses of oral psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016), acute and enduring anti-depressant effects were reported. In addition to these two open-label trials, there are several lines of evidence supporting using 5HT2A agonists to treat depression. In considering changes at the 5HT2A receptor as a potential mechanism of action: cortical 5HT2A receptor expression is increased in postmortem samples of patients with depression who display suicidality (Mendelson, 2000; Pandey et al., 2002; Shelton et al., 2009); depressed patients with elevated pessimism display increased PFC 5HT2A receptor binding compared to control participants (Bhagwagar et al., 2006; Meyer, 2012; Meyer et al., 2003); and sustained treatment with various anti-depressants (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic anti-depressants) have been associated with a reduction of 5HT2A receptor density (Gomez-Gil et al., 2004; Yamauchi et al., 2006). The glutamate system may explain some of the anti-depressant effects of psilocybin. In rodents, serotoninergic psychedelics enhance cortical glutamatergic transmission, especially in the medial PFC, and increase activation of cortical α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997). In a trial in which rats received DOI, there was a significant increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in neocortical areas (Vaidya et al., 1997). Increased AMPA activation and BDNF expression as biomarkers of anti-depressant effects are supported by: cortical AMPA activation is known to stimulate the expression of cortical BDNF (associated with neuronal growth, differentiation and synaptogenesis) (Hsu et al., 2015); decreased cortical BDNF is associated with major depression in humans (Duman, 2004); and cortical BDNF normalizes with anti-depressant treatment (Sen et al., 2008; Shimizu et al., 2003). Similarly, ketamine (the only other known acute and short-term sustained anti-depressant) is theorized to exert its anti-depressant effects via cortical AMPA activation (Zanos et al., 2016) and BDNF expression (Lepack et al., 2014). However, the anti-depressant effects of single-dose ketamine in patients with TRD typically last no more than several days up to 1–2 weeks, not several weeks to months (DeWilde et al., 2015). Neuroimaging research with psilocybin is beginning to suggest potential anti-depressant mechanisms of action at the level of brain structure activity and network connectivity. Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging research in normal volunteers under the influence of psilocybin has demonstrated decreased activity in the medial PFC and decreased connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2014). The former is significant because depressive symptoms have been associated with increased activity in the medial PFC (Drevets et al., 2008; Farb et al., 2011) and normalization of medial PFC activity has been demonstrated with anti-depressant treatment (Deakin et al., 2008; Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011; Kennedy et al., 2007); and the latter because patients with major depression (compared to controls) have demonstrated increased DMN connectivity (Berman et al., 2011, Grecius et al., 2007). Moderate-dose psilocybin occasioned mystical-type experiences in the cohort of cancer patients studied, and the intensity of the subjective mystical experience significantly mediated (e.g. suggestive of causality) clinical benefit (e.g. reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms) in the medium term (e.g. 6 weeks post-dose 1). This result matches with descriptive historical data from open-label LSD-assisted psychotherapy trials for psycho-spiritual distress associated with terminal cancer, in which the mystical experience was reported as being an integral part of the therapeutic effect (Grof and Halifax, 1977). It is further corroborated by recent open-label trials using psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat tobacco addiction (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2014) and alcoholism (Bogenschutz et al., 2015) showing significant correlations between the mystical experience and improved clinical outcomes. This finding suggests a potential psycho-spiritual mechanism of action: the mystical state of consciousness. The mystical experience is likely to be one of several mediators that transmit the effect of psilocybin to changes in anxiety and/or depression. Further enquiry into how particular dimensions of the mystical experience relate to reductions in anxiety and/or depression in this population and others, and what factors best predict or promote mystical experiences, is warranted.","In conclusion, single moderate-dose psilocybin (in conjunction with psychotherapy) was safely administered to a cohort of patients with cancer-related psychological distress (e.g. anxiety, depression). It produced rapid and sustained anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (for at least 7 weeks but potentially as long as 8 months), decreased cancer-related existential distress, increased spiritual wellbeing and quality of life, and was associated with improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects of psilocybin. Psilocybin, administered in conjunction with appropriate psychotherapy, could become a novel pharmacological-psychosocial treatment modality for cancer-related psychological and existential distress. Further empirical research is needed definitively to establish its safety and efficacy."
7,10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020,"In 1953, the British research psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond was investigating the psychotomimetic (psychosis mimicking) effects of mescaline, a psychedelic drug derived from the peyote cactus. The British author Aldous Huxley learned of Osmond's work and struck up a correspondence, requesting that Osmond supervise a personal psychedelic experience. Huxley's subsequent mescaline experience would become the subject of his famous book “The Doors of Perception” (Huxley, 1954). Like many before and after him, Huxley was profoundly affected by his experiences with psychedelics and in 1956 sought with Osmond a satisfactory term for this class of drugs. At the time, “psychotomimetics” and “hallucinogens” were popular, but both men felt that these referred to mere aspects of the drug experience and not its essential character. Huxley suggested “phanerothyme,” intending to mean “bringing forth the spirit or soul” (Huxley et al., 1977), and Osmond offered “psychedelic” combining the Greek words for “mind” or “soul” (psychē) with “dclôsē,” meaning “to manifest.” While it was Osmond's “psychedelic” that would stick, it is telling that both men were searching for a word that could denote the same essential property, i.e., psychedelic's ability to make manifest latent aspects of the mind. In 1943, Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered the extraordinary psychological properties of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (Hofmann, 1980) and the first reports on its effects appeared in scientific journals in the late 1940s. These papers immediately highlighted LSD's potential to be psychologically agitative. The first English language publication was released in 1950 and here the authors reported: “the effect of LSD was a transitory toxic state, disturbing the barrier of repression and permitting a re-examination of significant experiences of the past that were sometimes relived with a frightening realism.” (Busch and Johnson, 1950) In the following years, psychedelics became one of the most researched classes of psychoactive drug in science, with several hundred relevant publications (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979). During these years, the focus shifted from psychedelics as psychotomimetics to psychedelics as psychotherapeutic adjuncts, with major international conferences on the topic (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979) and even the construction of purpose-built psychedelic treatment centers (Sandison, 2001). Political pressure in the late 1960s led to the illegalization of psychedelics and this had a significant negative impact on legitimate scientific research (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979; Lee and Shlain, 1985)—a problem that continues today (Nutt et al., 2013). Despite this however, there has been a resurgence of scientific interest in psychedelics in recent years (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Nichols, 2004; Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008; Moreno et al., 2006; Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007; Grob et al., 2011; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a). The dominant theoretical and therapeutic approach during the early era of psychedelic research was psychoanalytic. Psychedelics were used therapeutically under the rationale that they work to lower psychological defenses to allow personal conflicts to come to the fore that can then be worked through with a therapist (Cohen, 1972). A related model was that the relinquishment of “ego” enabled profound existential or “peak” experiences to occur that could have a lasting positive impact on behavior and outlook (Savage, 1962). Innumerable cases of apparent spontaneous insights about “self” or “nature” exist in the literature on psychedelics (Cattell, 1954; Sandison, 1954; Sandison and Whitelaw, 1957; Denber, 1958; Hausner and Dolezal, 1965; Torda, 1969; Cohen, 1972; Grof, 1982) and reports of “ego-dissolution” or “disintegration” are commonplace among those who have experienced the effects of these drugs (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2010; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b). Some psychiatrists even believed that psychedelics could provide the necessary scientific evidence for major psychoanalytic hypotheses (Sandison, 1954; Cohen, 1972; Grof, 1982). For example, one enthused: “The phenomenology of the psychodynamic experiences in LSD sessions is to a large extent in agreement with the basic concepts of classical psychoanalysis… Observations from LSD psychotherapy could be considered laboratory proof of the basic Freudian premises.” (Grof, 1982). Psychoanalytic theory dominated psychiatry in the 1950s but after influential critiques (Eysenck, 1973), the cognitive revolution (Neisser, 1967) and significant pharmacological developments in psychiatry (Ban, 2001a,b; Fink, 2010), its influence significantly waned. As illustrated in Figure 1, despite over a century since its inception, psychoanalysis has failed to establish itself as a science of the mind. This may be because its hypotheses are hollow (Webster, 1995) or because they do not easily lend themselves to controlled experiment. In contrast, cognitive psychology is a mechanistic framework for describing observable phenomena that has become the natural bedfellow for human neuroscience. In comparison with the spectacular success of cognitive psychology, what should we make of the relative stagnancy of psychoanalysis? Is psychoanalysis scientifically redundant? Its fiercest critics claim that it is a belief system, a tautology with untestable hypotheses (Webster, 1995) but others claim that it has considerable explanatory value but could benefit from a closer integration with cognitive neuroscience (Kandel, 1999; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010; Panksepp and Solms, 2012). The present article takes this latter view and argues that the most realistic way forward for psychoanalysis as a science is for its most tangible hypotheses to be simplified and applied within the framework of cognitive neuroscience. Here we take the view that this is a necessary concession for psychoanalysis if it is to develop its credibility as a model of the mind. In what follows, a roadmap is presented for how scientific research with psychedelics can assist the integration of psychoanalysis with cognitive neuroscience in order to further our understanding of human consciousness. This is motivated by the view that psychoanalysis can contribute something substantial to the mind sciences because it bridges an explanatory gap that has been left vacant by cognitive psychology. This gap only exists because cognitive psychology (rightly) focuses on phenomena that can be observed and manipulated by controlled experiment but crucially, without psychedelic drugs, it is virtually impossible to bring the core phenomena of psychoanalytic theory into an observable space. Freud famously said of dreams that they provide privileged access to the workings of the unconscious mind (Freud, 1937) but research on dreaming is fraught with difficulties because [despite the phenomenon of lucid dreaming (Ogilvie et al., 1982)] the dream experience cannot be easily reflected on and reported in real-time, and neither can its onset and offset be easily controlled. Thus, Freud's cherished “royal road” has not proved particularly regal and a more practical alternative is required if key psychoanalytic theories are to be incorporated into the mind sciences.This article argues that controlled studies with psychedelics are capable of providing major new insights into the nature of the mind and how it arises from brain activity. This is because the mind must be thoroughly deconstructed in order for us to become cognizant of its constituents and how they interact to give rise to global phenomena. The unique scientific value of psychedelics rests on their ability to selectively target processes that appear to be critical for the maintenance of normal waking consciousness. In addressing the action of psychedelic drugs on the brain, this article begins at the cellular level before progressing to the systems level. The intention is to offer a comprehensive account of how psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness. Somewhat uniquely, psychedelics can be studied at a range of epistemological levels; from molecular pharmacology (Gonzalez-Maeso and Sealfon, 2009) to psychoanalytic psychology (Cohen, 1964; Grof, 1982), few topics can engage scientists from as wide a range of disciplines. This reflects not only the special research value of psychedelics but also the immensity of the challenge involved in understanding them; especially, if the intention is to develop a comprehensive account of how psychedelics affect the brain to alter consciousness. The present article should therefore be read with an acknowledgement that this quest is on-going. Before we begin, it is necessary to enter some important caveats. Firstly, it needs to be stated that those looking for evidence for the authenticity of aspects of Freudian theory will be left dissatisfied by this article. Categorically, this is not its aim. This challenge requires a thorough review of the phenomenology of relevant altered states of consciousness (e.g., the psychedelic state) and this is something that has been attempted before (Carhart-Harris, 2007; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). Thus, due to space limitations, this article's treatment of the relevant phenomenology is relatively superficial. Instead it places its focus on the system-level mechanics of the psychedelic state as an exemplar of a regressive8 style of cognition that can also be observed in REM sleep and early psychosis. Some proponents of psychoanalysis may feel that this mechanistic approach has little relevance to psychoanalysis in its hermeneutic or interpretative guise. However, the inherent subjectivity of this aspect of psychoanalysis means that it is difficult to see how it can ever significantly impinge on the scientific study of the mind and brain. Indeed, Freud acknowledged that it was his “metapsychology” that had the most to offer science (Freud, 1949), and at least as a first step, this is where psychoanalytic theory (rather than psychoanalytic practice) should look to develop its scientific credibility. Briefly, for readers who are unfamiliar with Freudian metapsychology and wish to understand it better, his original material should be read (e.g., Freud, 1927, 1949; Freud et al., 1957) and the following review articles may be useful (Carhart-Harris et al., 2008; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). For those interested in the rich phenomenology of the psychedelic experience and how this relates to Freudian and/or Jungian descriptions of “the unconscious mind,” the following references may be of interest (Sandison and Whitelaw, 1957; Huxley, 1959; Cohen, 1964; Grof, 1982; Merkur, 1998; Sandison, 2001). Lastly, it is necessary to state that questions related to the safety of scientific research with psychedelics will not be addressed here. However, evidence strongly supports the position that, conducted with appropriate caution, research with psychedelics presents a low risk of harm to study participants","This article has argued that scientific research with psychedelic drugs can have a revitalizing effect on psychoanalysis and an informing influence on mainstream psychology and psychiatry. Rather than discuss the content and interpretation of psychoanalytically-relevant material, we have adopted a mechanistic approach, in keeping with the mainstream cognitive neuroscience. This article proposes that a distinction can be made between two fundamentally different modes of cognition: primary and secondary consciousness. Primary consciousness is associated with unconstrained cognition and less ordered (higher-entropy) neurodynamics, whereas secondary consciousness is associated with constrained cognition and more ordered neurodynamics (i.e., that strikes an evolutionarily advantageous balance between order and disorder - that may or more not be perfectly “critical”). It is hoped that this mechanistic model will help catalyze a synthesis between psychoanalytic theory and cognitive neuroscience that can be mutually beneficial to both disciplines. It is a fair criticism of this paper that it has given insufficient consideration to the phenomenological content of the relevant altered states of consciousness, and to the specifics of Freudian theory, and so by neglecting this, has failed to present a sufficiently compelling case that these states have anything to do with psychoanalytic theory. To some extent, this charge can be conceded; however, as outlined in the introduction, the intention of this paper was to develop a mechanistic account of altered states of consciousness based on the quantity of entropy, and this task has demanded a substantial amount of space. A more thorough discussion of the phenomenology of primary states is required to develop the case that they show characteristics that are consistent with Freudian accounts of “the unconscious” or “Id.” The reader should be made aware however, that this has been attempted before (Carhart-Harris, 2007; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). To conclude, it is perhaps not surprising that with only dreaming and psychosis at its disposal, psychoanalysis has failed to convince the scientific community that the psychoanalytic unconscious exists (Hassin et al., 2005). From a neuroscientific perspective, dreaming and psychosis are notoriously difficult to study. The occurrence of dreaming in sleep impedes experimental control and psychosis is an especially complex and variegated phenomenon. However, for those brave enough to embrace it, research with psychedelics could herald the beginning of a new scientifically informed-psychoanalysis that has the potential to influence modern psychology and psychiatry. The unique scientific value of psychedelics rests in their capacity to make consciously accessible that which is latent in the mind. This paper takes the position that mainstream psychology and psychiatry have underappreciated the depth of the human mind by neglecting schools of thought that posit the existence an unconscious mind. Indeed, psychedelics' greatest value may be as a remedy for ignorance of the unconscious mind."
8,10.1590/1516-4446-2014-1496,"The results of the present investigation demonstrate that AYA has significant and quite impressive acute antidepressive effects. Score reductions were observed in both the HAM-D and MADRS scales on D1 and D7, and these effects lasted for several days. It is noteworthy that these changes showed a profile that was very similar across volunteers, regardless of the prior level of depression, i.e., the severity of the current depressive episode. The antidepressant potential of AYA was previously demonstrated in a study that reported a decrease in hopelessness symptoms after acute AYA intake The average time necessary for the onset of therapeutic action of commercially available antidepressants is 2 weeks.3 Considering currently available medications, the fast antidepressant action of AYA is promising, as it may provide faster reductions in depressive symptoms. Moreover, the antidepressant effects of AYA alkaloids may inspire a new area of depression research. Interestingly, symptoms increased on D14 as measured by the HAM-D and MADRS scales, although a subsequent significant decrease occurred on D21 in both scales. Although increased, HAM-D scores still remained 45% below baseline values, but this difference was nonsignificant. On the other hand, MADRS scores on D14 were significantly increased The decreases and increases in depressive symptoms after AYA administration could reflect complex intracellular events that remain active after the acute effects of AYA have subsided. The acute antidepressive effects of ketamine, for instance, may be sustained for weeks to months and are associated with increased synaptogenesis and spine formation, which seem to be related with increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels.4,5 Studies conducted in rodents by our group and by others using doses of 10-15 mg/kg harmine have demonstrated antidepressive effects for this compound, which were associated with increases in BDNF levels. Furthermore, harmine, THH, and harmaline are potent natural, selective, reversible, and competitive inhibitors of the MAO enzyme, especially of the MAO-A subtype.9,36 THH acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well as an MAOI.9,37 Inhibition of both systems - MAO and serotonin reuptake - may result in elevated levels of brain serotonin and other monoamines, producing antidepressant effects. The statistically significant reductions in BPRS-AD scores from D1 to D21 suggest that AYA produced antidepressive and anxiolytic effects. A previous study reported decreased panic-related signs after acute AYA intake. AYA administration did not produce statistically significant sensory, cognitive, or affective modifications as assessed by the BPRS and YMRS scales. Although nonsignificant, in the present study these effects were observed during a period ranging from 80 to 140 min after AYA administration, which is the time point when the subjective effects of AYA are peaking, as are DMT plasma levels. The absence of statistically significant effects on BPRS-TD scores could be explained by the DMT concentration found in our AYA batch (0.08 mg/mL), which is lower than DMT doses used in previous studies that reported significant psychotropic effects of AYA (0.53 mg/mL DMT).9,12 The nonsignificant effects of AYA on the BPRS-TD subscale suggest that changes in sensory perception and thought content may not be essential for therapeutic effects. AYA was well tolerated by all patients, suggesting that it can be safely administered to depressed patients. This result corroborates previous studies reporting a good tolerability profile for AYA administration to healthy volunteers.8-12,15,25,39 In the present study, the psychoactive effects of AYA were considered by participants as mild and short-lived, corroborating the nonsignificant effect of AYA on the BPRS-TD subscale. The nonsignificant increases in blood pressure replicate previous findings in human studies suggesting that AYA produces moderate cardiovascular effects. Early academic research on classical hallucinogens was designed considering the powerful influences of set (psychological state) and setting (environment) on the effects of this class of substances.40 Considering this background, in the present study volunteers were kept as comfortable as possible, remaining seated in a recliner in a quiet, dimly lit room throughout the experimental session. Investigator interference was minimal, allowing patients to concentrate on the effects of AYA. This safe environment may have reduced the probability of dysphoric reactions Vomiting was the only adverse effect reported by volunteers (50%). Patients were informed before the experimental session that vomiting was a possible effect of AYA, as nausea and vomiting are the most frequently reported adverse effects in clinical trials of acute AYA administration.8-12,15,39 In the present study, vomiting apparently did not have a significant influence on the antidepressive effects of AYA. Patients did not consider this emetic effect to be a severe discomfort, a result that is in line with previous studies of acute AYA administration to healthy volunteers, which reported that most participants regarded their AYA experience as pleasant despite the occurrence of vomiting In future studies, it would be interesting to try to reduce the emetic effect of AYA by premedicating with an antiemetic. However, this possibility should be explored with caution, considering that AYA alkaloids could interact with antiemetic drugs. Another possibility could be to administer AYA in different formulations. Freeze-dried AYA appears to produce less vomiting than oral AYA.8,11,15,39 Interestingly, variable degrees of nausea, vomiting, and, occasionally, simultaneous diarrhea are common in AYA rituals. In these contexts, however, these purgative effects are considered positive and cleansing. Important limitations of the present open-label study include the small sample size, the absence of a systematic inquiry about side effects, and the lack of placebo and control groups. Although patients did not spontaneously report adverse effects other than vomiting, the lack of a systematic assessment of adverse effects may have reduced the likelihood of registering more subtle effects, such as impacts on cognition. Future studies should assess the possible adverse effects of AYA in clinical populations by using other subjective measures, such as visual analogue scales and other scales that measure hallucinogenic effects, and by exploring other variables that could be modified by AYA administration as reported in previous studies, such as neuropsychological, neurophysiological, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immunological parameters. Ideally, future studies involving AYA and depressed patients or other clinical populations should also be designed to include a control group. This group could receive a placebo, a comparator drug with an established therapeutic indication, or AYA preceded by pretreatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist to investigate possible mechanisms of action. Regarding the small number of patients, additional studies with larger sample sizes and using neuroimaging techniques (single photon emission tomography, SPECT) are underway in our laboratory. The aforementioned limitations should be considered taking into account the novelty of this research and its preliminary nature. To our knowledge, the use of AYA in a controlled clinical setting in patients with current depression - or in any other clinical population - has never been investigated. Moreover, the results of the present study, although preliminary, are corroborated by mounting research showing antidepressive potentials for AYA alkaloids in nonhuman animals16-24 and in humans. Finally, the reported results may prompt novel research into substances with faster therapeutic actions than currently available pharmacological resources, thus making antidepressive treatment more effective. The findings of this preliminary study demonstrate the potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of AYA, effects that, importantly, have an earlier onset of action when compared to traditional antidepressants. These findings suggest that AYA may represent a powerful new substance for the treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, these results deserve careful analysis, given the inherent limitations of an uncontrolled, open-label study with a small sample size. Other studies are needed to replicate these preliminary observations and to test, for example, the most effective dose (or doses) of AYA and the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of AYA administration over a longer period of time.",
9,10.1177/0269881117725915,"It is appropriate to acknowledge some of limitations of this review. Only two serotonin receptor subtypes have been discussed in depth and it would be wrong to dismiss the contribution of the others. For example, some relatively new antidepressants have an important (antagonist) action at 5-HT2C receptors (which has secondary faciliatory effects on DA transmission) (MacIsaac et al., 2014) and others, such as vortioxetine, have appreciable affinities for several other 5-HT receptors (Riga et al., 2016; Thase et al., 2016) – perhaps most notably, the 5-HT6 receptor (Karila et al., 2015)). Similarly, we did not address literature on functional selectivity or agonist trafficking (Berg et al., 1998; Gray and Roth, 2001; Meana, 2013) and neither have we discussed the role of heterodimers in serotonergic and particularly 5-HT2AR functioning (Gonzalez-Maeso, 2011, 2014; Gonzalez-Maeso and Sealfon, 2012), nor the role of glutamatergic mechanisms that follow 5-HT2AR signalling and how these are involved in plasticity (Aghajanian and Marek, 1999). It should also be acknowledged that much importance has been ascribed to psychedelics’ 5-HT2AR agonist properties but many of the psychedelic compounds featured also possess considerable actions at other 5-HT receptors, including the 5-HT1AR (Nichols, 2004). Although we acknowledge this limitation, we also wish to emphasise that the evidence is compelling that 5-HT2AR agonism is key to psychedelics’ most characteristic effects (Halberstadt, 2015), 5-HT1AR agonism attenuates rather than augments these effects (Pokorny et al., 2016; Strassman, 1996) and more selective 5-HT2AR agonists appear to have the same quintessential psychological effects as the less selective psychedelics (Halberstadt, 2017). We acknowledge that what is presented here is a simplified and therefore incomplete picture of brain serotonin function. This was an intentional approach (and compromise) however, as our main aim was not to produce an exhaustive review of serotonin transmission at its many receptors but rather distil it down to some key principles. We chose to focus on the 5-HT1A and 2A receptors because we felt that the functions associated with their signalling give the most comprehensive perspective of the general functioning of brain serotonin transmission. These two receptors are more implicated in the pharmacology of major psychiatric disorders than any of the other 5-HT receptor subtypes (Artigas et al., 2013b; Azmitia, 2007) – although others have highlighted the 5-HT1B receptor using a similar argument (Nautiyal and Hen, 2017) and it must be conceded that wealth of data does not necessarily imply strength of relationship. However, that the 5-HT1A and 2A receptors have opposite effects on single cell activity has long been a matter of intrigue (Araneda and Andrade, 1991). Crucially, that these receptors also seem to subserve distinct functions (Table 1) implies that the 5-HT system is not just diverse, but adaptive. We propose that the 5-HT system is specifically adaptive to the severity of adversity and whether it is better to passively tolerate it (with the assistance of 5-HT1AR signalling) or more actively respond it via a major change in perspective and/or behaviour (with the assistance of 5-HT2AR signalling). Another criticism of this paper is that it has focused too much on 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics and MDMA, rather than on classical preclinical behavioural literature and less potent serotonergic manipulations. In defence of our approach, the primacy we have given to research on psychedelics has allowed us to conceive a truly novel model of brain serotonin function. The most unique component of our model is pathway 2 (Figure 3), i.e. that 5-HT2AR signalling mediates plasticity related processes in aid of active coping. That this pathway has not previously been emphasised in models of serotonin function may have been due to a historical focus on the association between 5-HT2AR agonism and pathology and an insufficient willingness to acknowledge and endeavour to study these drugs’ complex subjective effects. We share the view of others (Grof, 1979; Heifets and Malenka, 2016) that 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics and MDMA are remarkably powerful tools for studying the human brain and mind – and their scientific and medicinal value has not yet been properly appreciated (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). We also believe that human studies with these compounds can be done safely if appropriate safeguards are heeded (Johnson et al., 2008). It could be argued that too much emphasis has been placed on extreme states in this paper that are not relevant to normal physiological conditions. Basal 5-HT2AR signalling has shown to be important for the maintenance of normal levels of cognitive flexibility (Boulougouris et al., 2008; Clarke et al., 2004, 2007) and may also account for traits such as high ‘absorption’ (Ott et al., 2005). We subscribe to the principle that challenging a system with an extreme perturbation can yield especially valuable insights about its normal functioning, by pushing it to and beyond its limits. Moreover, given that evolutionary pressures are major drivers of adaptation and change, understanding how a particular function operates during extreme conditions (e.g. when one’s life is in danger), may be particularly informative about why that function exists at all. It seems reasonable to infer that states induced by MDMA and 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics may be possible to achieve without these drugs, if only at an attenuated level. These drugs may therefore justifiably be considered ‘unveilers of function’. Note: the term ‘psychedelic’ literally means ‘mind-revealing’. Relatedly, it is intriguing to speculate that 5-HT2AR signalling may have played an important role in human evolutionary as well as ontogenetic development, perhaps through enhancing plasticity and adaptability during extreme conditions. The 5-HT2AR is densest in evolutionary recent brain regions (Beliveau et al., 2016; Erritzoe et al., 2009; Ettrup et al., 2014, 2016; Varnas et al., 2004; ). Indeed, it is readily apparent in Figure 1 that 5-HT2AR expression is especially dense in regions of the so-called default-mode network, which is associated with especially high-level psychological functions, such as self-consciousness and the ‘self’ or ‘ego’ itself (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010) as well as the acute network level effects of psychedelics, as determined by human neuroimaging studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). By body weight, humans have vastly more cortex than other species (MacLean, 1990; Molnar et al., 2014) (where 5-HT2ARs are densest (Ettrup et al., 2014)) and our remarkable adaptability is one of our most defining species traits (Anton et al., 2014) – as is our sense of self. It has been hypothesised by a popular proponent of psychedelic drug-use (Terrence McKenna) that ingestion of naturally occurring psychedelics (e.g. psilocybe mushrooms) catalysed the evolution of the human neocortex (Abraham et al., 1998). A perhaps more plausible (and less psychedelic-centric) alternative however, is that non-linearities evolved in the serotonergic system (Erritzoe et al., 2010; Jansson et al., 2001) that conferred optimal adaptability, including a capacity to switch to greater 5-HT2AR signalling when conditions demand it (such as during extreme adversity). Future work may endeavour to test the hypothesis that 5-HT2AR signalling serves an exceptional function in humans. The vastness of our 5-HT2AR dense cortex suggests that this hypothesis is worth exploring, and the development of agonist radioligands that can label the 5-HT2AR in its high affinity state may help us in this regard (Ettrup et al., 2014, 2016; Jorgensen et al., 2016). Regarding neuroimaging the psychedelic state, this is a nascent and fast-moving field and it would be beyond the scope of this article to discuss the relevant published findings in detail (this area is deserving of its own review paper). Suffice to say that an emergent principle from the various studies is that the brain is uncharacteristically ‘entropic’ in the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), reflecting a greatly heightened plasticity in which old material may be unlearned (consistent with the principles of extinction learning) and new ideas and associations learned. It might be argued (unfairly in our view) that the present contribution on the function of brain serotonin has not added anything new to previous models (Andrews et al., 2015; Azmitia, 2007; Branchi, 2011; Dayan and Huys, 2009; Deakin, 1998). We acknowledge that the model presented here has been much inspired by previous attempts to resolve this enigma but feel it also significantly advances on them and is entirely novel in its own right. It integrates findings that were inspirational for previous models but also assimilates recent and (perhaps somewhat overlooked) data on the brain and behavioural effects of potent serotonergic drugs such as MDMA and the 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics. Previous models acknowledged the role of hippocampal 5-HT1AR signalling in resilience (Deakin, 2013; Deakin and Graeff, 1991) but we have significantly extended on this by our thorough coverage of 5-HT2AR functioning and its mediation of plasticity in aid of optimal adaptability. Regarding specific past contributions, we acknowledge the work of Deakin and Graeff (Deakin, 2013; Deakin and Graeff, 1991) and others (Cools et al., 2008; Crockett et al., 2009; Wise et al., 1970) concerning the role of 5-HT in aversive processing, plus the increasingly compelling work on serotonin’s role in promoting patience (Fonseca et al., 2015; Miyazaki et al., 2012, 2014) and collectively relate these to our hypothesis that postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling mediates passive coping in response to adversity. It is worth commenting on a nuance here: in Deakin and Graeff’s model, 5-HT1AR signalling is linked to chronic adversity – which we do not dispute; however, we would argue that 5-HT2AR signalling becomes increasingly relevant as the severity of adversity reaches a critical point. Indeed, we have emphasised the importance of the severity of adversity in our model – but it may be worthwhile to also consider the role of the chronicity of adversity in determining the differential engagement of 5-HT receptor subtypes (Cohen et al., 2015; Dayan and Huys, 2009). We also acknowledge the increasingly appealing perspectives of Branchi (2011), Belsky et al. (2009) and others (Homberg, 2012) concerning serotonin and plasticity, and relate this to our hypothesis that 5-HT2AR signalling mediates plasticity in aid of optimal adaptability. We acknowledge Andrew et al.’s hypothesis of serotonin mediating an adaptive homeostasis (Andrews et al., 2015) (see also Hale et al. (2013)) and believe this could be broadly related to our bipartite model. However, we feel our model is more psychologically focused, receptor specific, and consistent with the classical view that enhanced 5-HT transmission (within certain bounds and contexts) is conducive to positive mood. Perspectives such as Andrews and colleagues (2015) that challenge this view, cite, among other things, the relationship between punishment, 5-HT release and depression – to endorse the perspective that serotonergic functioning is elevated in depression (Barton et al., 2008)). Consistent with the classical (Wise et al., 1970) and arguably still dominant perspective (Cowen and Browning, 2015) however, our view is that increased 5-HT release in response to adversity is functional rather than pathological, serving to moderate stress via postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling, and in extreme cases, initiate a rapid plasticity in the service of major change – via 5-HT2AR signalling.","This paper has sought to address a major unresolved problem in neuropsychopharmacology, namely what is the function of brain serotonin? It proposes that the principal function of brain serotonin is to enhance adaptive responses to adverse conditions via two distinct pathways: (1) a passive coping pathway which improves stress tolerability; and (2) an active coping pathway associated with heightened plasticity, which, with support, can improve an organism’s ability to identify and overcome source(s) of stress by changing outlook and/or behaviour. Crucially, we propose that these two functions are mediated by signalling at postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors respectively, with 5-HT1AR signalling dominating under ordinary conditions but 5-HT2AR signalling becoming increasingly operative as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We suggest that the two functions of interest (5-HT1AR-mediated stress relief and 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity) are sufficiently distinct – and may even be mutually oppositional in certain contexts (see also Azmitia, 2001), evoking dilemmas over whether it is better to passively endure or actively approach, and in so doing, initiate some sort of fundamental change – with the potential for major resolution. This rule may not be absolute however, and the two functions may also be complementary, e.g. in the case of enhanced serotonin functioning with chronic SSRI use – or indeed with normal basal 5-HT functioning, facilitating improved endurance and plasticity (Clarke et al., 2004, 2007; Mithoefer et al., 2011, 2016; van Apeldoorn et al., 2008) Despite this complementarity, we do anticipate that conventional serotonergic antidepressants such as the SSRIs and classic psychedelics such as psilocybin may become competitive options for the treatments of certain disorders such as depression; most fundamentally because they work via distinct pathways (i.e. 5-HT1AR versus the 5-HT2AR signalling) – but also because they cannot easily be taken in combination, i.e. conventional antidepressants attenuate the characteristic psychological effects of psychedelics (Bonson et al., 1996; Bonson and Murphy, 1996). SSRIs are established evidence-based treatments for anxiety and major depression (Baldwin et al., 2016; Hieronymus et al., 2016), whereas psychedelics are experimental medicines in an early phase of development (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016). However, if evidence supporting the therapeutic value of psychedelics accrues – as we anticipate, and it is increasingly shown that their therapeutic mechanisms are significantly distinct from those of conventional medications, then this will open-up new and potentially empowering options for patients and clinicians (as well as a real potential for resistance – however it may arise). For the brave new psychiatry of the future – that many would like to see (Miller, 2010) – decisions about whether to passively endure or actively address, may become increasingly pertinent."
10,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.022,"Classical serotonergic psychedelics are known to cause changes in mood (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011) and brain function (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017) that persist long after the acute effects of the drugs have subsided. Moreover, several psychedelics elevate glutamate levels in the cortex (Nichols, 2004, Nichols, 2016) and increase gene expression in vivo of the neurotrophin BDNF as well as immediate-early genes associated with plasticity (Martin et al., 2014, Nichols and Sanders-Bush, 2002, Vaidya et al., 1997). This indirect evidence has led to the reasonable hypothesis that psychedelics promote structural and functional neural plasticity, although this assumption had never been rigorously tested (Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). The data presented here provide direct evidence for this hypothesis, demonstrating that psychedelics cause both structural and functional changes in cortical neurons Prior to this study, two reports suggested that psychedelics might be able to produce changes in neuronal structure. Jones et al. (2009) demonstrated that DOI was capable of transiently increasing the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, but no change in spine density was observed. The second study showed that DOI promoted neurite extension in a cell line of neuronal lineage (Marinova et al., 2017). Both of these reports utilized DOI, a psychedelic of the amphetamine class. Here we demonstrate that the ability to change neuronal structure is not a unique property of amphetamines like DOI because psychedelics from the ergoline, tryptamine, and iboga classes of compounds also promote structural plasticity. Additionally, D-amphetamine does not increase the complexity of cortical dendritic arbors in culture, and therefore, these morphological changes cannot be simply attributed to an increase in monoamine neurotransmission The identification of psychoplastogens belonging to distinct chemical families is an important aspect of this work because it suggests that ketamine is not unique in its ability to promote structural and functional plasticity. In addition to ketamine, the prototypical psychoplastogen, only a relatively small number of plasticity-promoting small molecules have been identified previously. Such compounds include the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ligand GLYX-13 (i.e., rapastinel), the mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495, the TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF, and the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (Lepack et al., 2016, Castello et al., 2014, Zeng et al., 2012, Voleti et al., 2013). We observe that hallucinogens from four distinct structural classes (i.e., tryptamine, amphetamine, ergoline, and iboga) are also potent psychoplastogens, providing additional lead scaffolds for medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at identifying neurotherapeutics. Furthermore, our cellular assays revealed that several of these compounds were more efficacious (e.g., MDMA) or more potent (e.g., LSD) than ketamine. In fact, the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics and entactogens rivaled that of BDNF (Figures 3A–3C and S3). The extreme potency of LSD in particular might be due to slow off kinetics, as recently proposed following the disclosure of the LSD-bound 5-HT2B crystal structure (Wacker et al., 2017) Importantly, the psychoplastogenic effects of psychedelics in cortical cultures were also observed in vivo using both vertebrate and invertebrate models, demonstrating that they act through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Furthermore, the concentrations of psychedelics utilized in our in vitro cell culture assays were consistent with those reached in the brain following systemic administration of therapeutic doses in rodents (Yang et al., 2018, Cohen and Vogel, 1972). This suggests that neuritogenesis, spinogenesis, and/or synaptogenesis assays performed using cortical cultures might have value for identifying psychoplastogens and fast-acting antidepressants. It should be noted that our structural plasticity studies performed in vitro utilized neurons exposed to psychedelics for extended periods of time. Because brain exposure to these compounds is often of short duration due to rapid metabolism, it will be interesting to assess the kinetics of psychedelic-induced plasticity A key question in the field of psychedelic medicine has been whether or not psychedelics promote changes in the density of dendritic spines (Kyzar et al., 2017). Using super-resolution SIM, we clearly demonstrate that psychedelics do, in fact, increase the density of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, an effect that is not restricted to a particular structural class of compounds. Using DMT, we verified that cortical neuron spine density increases in vivo and that these changes in structural plasticity are accompanied by functional effects such as increased amplitude and frequency of spontaneous EPSCs. We specifically designed these experiments to mimic previous studies of ketamine (Li et al., 2010) so that we might directly compare these two compounds, and, to a first approximation, they appear to be remarkably similar. Not only do they both increase spine density and neuronal excitability in the cortex, they seem to have similar behavioral effects. We have shown previously that, like ketamine, DMT promotes fear extinction learning and has antidepressant effects in the forced swim test (Cameron et al., 2018). These results, coupled with the fact that ayahuasca, a DMT-containing concoction, has potent antidepressant effects in humans (Osório et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016, Santos et al., 2007), suggests that classical psychedelics and ketamine might share a related therapeutic mechanism. Although the molecular targets of ketamine and psychedelics are different (NMDA and 5-HT2A receptors, respectively), they appear to cause similar downstream effects on structural plasticity by activating mTOR. This finding is significant because ketamine is known to be addictive whereas many classical psychedelics are not (Nutt et al., 2007, Nutt et al., 2010). The exact mechanisms by which these compounds stimulate mTOR is still not entirely understood, but our data suggest that, at least for classical psychedelics, TrkB and 5-HT2A receptors are involved. Although most classical psychedelics are not considered to be addictive, there are still significant safety concerns with their use in medicine because they cause profound perceptual disturbances and still have the potential to be abused. Therefore, the identification of non-hallucinogenic analogs capable of promoting plasticity in the PFC could facilitate a paradigm shift in our approach to treating neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, such compounds could be critical to resolving the long-standing debate in the field concerning whether the subjective effects of psychedelics are necessary for their therapeutic effects (Majić et al., 2015). Although our group is actively investigating the psychoplastogenic properties of non-hallucinogenic analogs of psychedelics, others have reported the therapeutic potential of safer structural and functional analogs of ketamine (Moskal et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2015, Zanos et al., 2016). Our data demonstrate that classical psychedelics from several distinct chemical classes are capable of robustly promoting the growth of both neurites and dendritic spines in vitro, in vivo, and across species. Importantly, our studies highlight the similarities between the effects of ketamine and those of classical serotonergic psychedelics, supporting the hypothesis that the clinical antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of these molecules might result from their ability to promote structural and functional plasticity in prefrontal cortical neurons. We have demonstrated that the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics require TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A signaling, suggesting that these key signaling hubs may serve as potential targets for the development of psychoplastogens, fast-acting antidepressants, and anxiolytics. Taken together, our results suggest that psychedelics may be used as lead structures to identify next-generation neurotherapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles.",
11,10.1007/s00213-017-4771-x,"This paper presents updated and extended data from an open-label clinical trial assessing psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression. Findings corroborate our (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016) and others’ previous results (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016; Grob et al. 2011) supporting the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for depressive and anxiety symptoms. A fast and sustained response exceeding what might be expected from a placebo response was observed in many of the patients (see Carhart-Harris and Nutt (2016) for a relevant discussion). Notably, all 19 completers showed some reductions in the QIDS-SR16 scores at 1-week post-treatment and (nominally) maximal effects were seen at 5 weeks. Other interventions, not formally part of the present trial, confounded outcomes at 3 and 6 months, although safety was maintained and a sizeable proportion of the sample continued to demonstrate benefit (see Watts et al. (2017) for more details). Conclusions on efficacy are limited by the absence of a control condition in this trial, however. Recent studies (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016; Carhart-Harris et al. 2016), including the present one, help demonstrate the feasibility of treating patients with major depressive disorder with psilocybin plus psychological support. Two recent double-blind randomised control trials (RCTs) of psilocybin for depression and anxiety symptoms in a combined sample of 80 patients with life-threatening cancer found consistent safety and efficacy outcomes with those reported here (Griffiths et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2016). Only a subset of patients recruited into these studies met the criteria for major depressive disorder however, and symptoms were not of the same severity as those seen here (i.e. mean baseline BDI scores were 18.1 and 16 in the Griffiths et al. and Ross et al. studies, respectively, whereas they were 35 in the present study). A comprehensive RCT designed to properly assess psilocybin’s efficacy for major depressive disorder, with some form of placebo control, is therefore warranted (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Regarding mechanisms, we recently proposed a model by which psychedelic-induced 5-HT2AR signalling rapidly induces an acute state of plasticity in which an enriched context (Carhart-Harris et al., in review) may lead to cognitive biases being revised (Carhart-Harris and Nutt 2017; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017)—see also Branchi (2011). The above-reported correlation between acute ‘insightfulness’ and enduring reductions in depressive symptoms may be viewed as broadly supportive of this model. Moreover, recently published fMRI data collected as part of the present trial may help to develop and refine this model (Roseman et al., in review; Carhart-Harris et al., in review). Future research should endeavour to better characterise, control and measure the various psychological components contained within the current psychedelic treatment model. There is an assumption that individuals under the influence of a psychedelic are especially sensitive to the context in which the experience occurs, both in terms of (1) prior expectations and other relevant state and trait factors and (2) environmental factors, e.g. the quality of the relationships with persons attending to them before, during and after the experience and patients’ relationship to the music listened to during the sessions (Kaelen et al. 2015)—and this matter has recently been discussed in length (Carhart-Harris et al., in review). In order to properly assess the relative contribution of these variables and their assumed interactions with psilocybin, it will be necessary to properly control and measure them, and this has presently not yet been done to a satisfactory level (see Carhart-Harris et al. (in review) for suggestions on how this might be done). Relatedly, psychotherapeutic models used to support and mediate the psilocybin experience need to be better defined, tested and potentially manualised. Basic principles for safe therapeutic work with psychedelics can be found in guidelines (Johnson et al. 2008) and books (Richards 2015) but more systematic verification, refinement and (eventual) manualisation of treatment approaches are needed for subsequent roll-out (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Moreover, cost-effectiveness will become increasingly salient as the development of psilocybin as a treatment model progresses. The major qualifier here is that experiments intended to evaluate the contribution of psychological variables to the psychedelic experience need to be conceived and conducted with an appreciation of the special vulnerability of individuals under the influence of psychedelics (again, see Carhart-Harris et al. (in review). Thus, certain standards of care, including a certain level of psychological support, may be non-negotiable if safety is to be maintained. An obvious limitation of the present study is its open-label design and absence of a control condition. The initial plan was to conduct a placebo-controlled RCT but regulatory and drug procurement challenges meant that available resources could only support a smaller trial. The present results may be viewed as a successful demonstration of proof-of-principle, however, supporting the view that psilocybin can be given safely, even in severe cases of depression, with the caveat that appropriate control of context (e.g. the provision of psychological support and a comfortable environment) is essential for positive outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., in review). Impressions of efficacy gleaned from the present study’s findings may be cautiously described as ‘promising’—and if supported by larger and better controlled trials, psilocybin’s low toxicity, favourable side effect profile and putative rapid and enduring antidepressant action could render it at least competitive with currently available treatments for major depression, whose therapeutic actions may be either delayed, e.g. in the cases of SSRIs and psychotherapy, or short-lived, e.g. in the case of ketamine. Comparative efficacy trials may therefore be an interesting next step. Such designs may also have merit in terms of addressing the challenge of maintaining the study blind in trials with psychedelics (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Another limitation of the present trial is that the final eight patients were all male. This is regretful as it limits extrapolation to the general population, where rates of treatment-resistant depression may be marginally higher in women than in men (Kubitz et al. 2013). Greater effort will be made in future trials to recruit more representative samples of the target population. Another limitation deserving of mention is the issue of assessing duration of current depressive episode. Patients gave estimates based on the question “For how long has your current depression lasted?” but some chose to estimate based on the duration of their chronic illness, believing they had not experienced a discernable remission for years–decades, even during periods when their symptoms were relatively less severe. In summary, we have presented updated and extended data from a feasibility trial assessing psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression. With the caveat that this was an open-label trial with no control condition, safety and efficacy outcomes continue to support the case for further research (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin 2017). Identifying key psychological and pharmacological variables comprising the treatment model, and testing their assumed interactions, is one of a number of important next steps (Carhart-Harris et al., in review).",
12,10.1097/JCP.0000000000000436,"Administration of ayahuasca was associated with rapid and sustained antidepressive effects. Results were similar across volunteers, regardless of the severity of the current depressive episode. Ayahuasca administration was also associated with increased blood perfusion in the nucleus accumbens, insula, and subgenual area, brain regions involved in the regulation of mood and emotional states. Significant score decreases in HAM-D, MADRS, and Anxious-Depression BPRS subscale scores were observed during acute drug effects and from D1 to D21 and were related to depressed mood, sadness, anxiety, feelings of guilt, suicidal ideation, difficulties at work/activities, pessimistic thinking, and difficulty concentrating. Improvements in emotional withdrawal and blunted affect were (Thinking Disorder and Withdrawal-Retardation BPRS subscales) were also observed. Ayahuasca induced significant score increases in the CADSS scale at 40 to 80 minutes, suggesting increased psychoactivity in the same time point previously associated with peak ayahuasca psychoactive effects and DMT plasma levels.1–3 No significant changes in YMRS and Activation BPRS subscale scores were observed after ayahuasca intake, suggesting an absence of maniac-like effects. However, it is important to note that in our study a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and a previous history of mania or hypomania induced by antidepressant or substance use were considered exclusion criteria. Ayahuasca may be contraindicated for bipolar disorders patients, since a recent case report described a man with bipolar disorder that developed a manic episode after ayahuasca consumption.12 Increased blood perfusion in the subgenual area, nucleus accumbens, and insula were observed after ayahuasca intake. Hypoactivation of these brain regions is usually associated with depression, while increased activation is usually associated with antidepressive effects.13–17 Interestingly, ayahuasca increased blood perfusion in the anterior insula of healthy volunteers, but no significant changes were observed in the subgenual area or nucleus accumbens.3 These data suggest that our results may be specific to depressive patients. The potential antidepressant effects of ayahuasca appear to be mediated by the agonist action of DMT on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors, since agonists of these receptors produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects.18,19 Indeed, administration of DMT and other 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists such as psilocybin and LSD is associated with increases in positive mood in healthy volunteers20–22 and in patients suffering life-threatening diseases.23,24 Functional alterations in the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain regions associated with self-perception, could also mediate the observed effects. Rumination, a core depressive symptom, is associated with increased DMN activity, and ayahuasca25 and psilocybin26 may reduce this activity.25 Theoretically, by changing one’s self-perception, hallucinogens may reduce excessive attention to repetitive and pathological thoughts.1,25,26 Interestingly, decreases in brain blood flow observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies25,26 are inconsistent with our results and previous SPECT/positron emission tomography (PET) studies.1,3,27 These discrepancies may be related to different timescales involved in fMRI and SPECT/PET studies, which use radiotracers with long half-lives. Thus, phasic or short-term decreases in blood flow measured with fMRI may show some rebound effects and longer-term changes that are detected by SPECT/PET.26 Ayahuasca was well tolerated. No significant cardiovascular effects were observed after ayahuasca intake, and vomiting was the only adverse effect recorded. However, patients did not consider vomiting as causing severe discomfort. Moreover, ayahuasca psychoactive effects were considered mild and short-lived, and no dysphoric effects were reported. Indeed, volunteers were calm and relaxed under the effects of ayahuasca, considering it as a pleasant experience. Although described results are promising, because treatment was not randomized or double-blind, and there was no placebo or other comparator group, we cannot conclude that the observed changes were in fact caused by ayahuasca. Moreover, it is important to note that the controlled clinical setting in which the experiments took place is different from the typical ritual context of ayahuasca consumption, which may impact the generalizability of our findings.6,28 Our results should be replicated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, and future research should investigate whether or how a ceremonial/ritual context may impact therapeutic outcomes.",
13,10.3389/fphar.2013.00161,"The development of ketamine as a rapidly acting antidepressant drug has the potential to revolutionize clinical treatment. Nevertheless, the clinical use of ketamine for depression poses a number of challenges. Ketamine is an hallucinogenic drug subject to abuse and must be given in a controlled setting. The effects of ketamine are short-lasting and can only be sustained by its repeated treatment. A desirable research direction would be to develop other drugs with similar antidepressant effects that are devoid of ketamine's liabilities. However, progress in this area is constrained by uncertainty concerning the critical pharmacological mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Animal models have the potential to translate the pharmacological effects of ketamine that are most critical for its clinical antidepressant effects. A substantial body of literature now indicates that ketamine produces antidepressant-like effects in preclinical tests for antidepressant activity and in animal models of depression. Acute ketamine produces immediate effects on many behavioral tests that are similar to antidepressants. However, the protracted effects of ketamine measured for days after a single administration are not produced by conventional antidepressants. They define a new paradigm for antidepressant drug discovery that is the best temporal correlate with ketamine's clinical activity. Inconsistent findings across laboratories may arise from a disparity in methodology used across studies. The most pertinent variables are that the efficacious dose is dependent on the behavioral task employed, conditions surrounding administration and the time of testing post-administration of ketamine. For example, evidence suggests that the effects of low and seemingly sub-efficacious doses of ketamine are more effective following stress exposure. Behavioral tests with high predictive validity for antidepressant-like effects, such as the FST, are sensitive to acute and chronic ketamine. They can be utilized in conjunction with other tests sensitive only to chronic antidepressant treatment, such as the NSF/SPT, to measure the protracted benefits that are unique to ketamine. Overall, combination of a stress or genetic model of depression/anxiety with behavioral assessment over a 1–2 week period post-treatment with low doses of ketamine will yield the most valid and useful information. Among the many barriers to translation of ketamine's clinical antidepressant effects across species stand a number of key pharmacological factors. The route of administration of ketamine in preclinical models is by i.p. injection, whereas intravenous infusion is usually employed in clinical trials. Therefore, it may be beneficial for animal studies to employ intravenous infusion where practical. In addition, plasma levels of ketamine monitored in the first 2 h following administration can determine whether the dose/route of administration of ketamine produces comparable bioavailability across species. Given that the half-life of ketamine is short, differing levels of ketamine may account for some variation in the behavioral tests. However, ketamine is no longer present when protracted behavioral effects are measured days after administration. These protracted changes result from rapid and sustained molecular alterations induced following a single treatment with ketamine. In addition, the preservative benzethonium chloride (BCl) is universally used in ketamine preparations both for clinical and preclinical use. Although present in low concentrations, BCl can act synergistically with ketamine to inhibit muscarinic and α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Durieux and Nietgen, 1997; Coates and Flood, 2001). The extent to which the additive properties of BCl on ketamine-induced modulation of the cholinergic system may affect the antidepressant-like response to ketamine is unknown. In the present review, there was no systematic evidence that positive or negative findings were associated with the source of ketamine in the behavioral studies examined here The mechanisms underlying ketamine's effects, the simultaneous blockade of NMDA receptors and activation of AMPA receptors, are integral for the induction of the antidepressant response. The long-term consequences of these molecular alterations are likely to mediate ketamine's protracted antidepressant-like effects mediated via increased synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival and maturation. These changes occur within hours of ketamine administration and occur in parallel with both the rapid and protracted behavioral effects in animal models of depression. The rapid modulation of mTOR, its downstream mediators, such as Akt and ERK, and BDNF represent markers of the molecular correlates of the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its ability to modify synaptic plasticity. Novel therapeutics for TRD are likely to modulate these markers in a similar temporal pattern to that of ketamine and can be used to identify better pharmaceutical agents to treat TRD.",
14,10.3389/fphar.2017.00974,"Consistent with our prior hypothesis, psilocybin-induced high OBN (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and low DED (similar to anxiety) predicted positive long-term clinical outcomes in a clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD. This result replicates those of previous studies showing that psychedelic-induced peak or mystical-type experiences are predictive of positive long-term outcomes (O'Reilly and Funk, 1964; Klavetter and Mogar, 1967; Pahnke et al., 1970; Kurland et al., 1972; Richards et al., 1977; Maclean et al., 2011; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). This relationship appears to be somewhat specific, in that OBN was significantly more predictive of positive clinical outcomes than altered visual and auditory perception—endorsing the moniker “psychedelic” (“mind-revealing”) over “hallucinogen” when referring to this class of drug—at least in the context of psychedelic therapy. It also suggests that the therapeutic effects of psilocybin are not a simple product of isolated pharmacological action but rather are experience dependent. We also found that greater DED (anxiety and impaired cognition) experienced during the drug session was predictive of less positive clinical outcomes. One may naturally infer from these findings that the occurrence of OBN or mystical-type experience mediates long-term positive clinical outcomes (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016) and while this assumption may be valid, we must exercise caution about ascribing too much to this relationship. It remains possible that as yet unmeasured and therefore unaccounted for components of psychedelic therapy play important roles in mediating long-term outcomes. There are several candidate factors in this regard, and the following should not be considered an exhaustive list: emotional insight/breakthrough or catharsis; priming and suggestibility; reliving of trauma/defining life events; insights about the self and relationships; the patients relationship to music heard; his/her success at “letting go”; the quality of therapeutic relationship; and the degree of “closure” attained during post-drug integration work These factors may exert influence before, during and after the acute experience itself and may also be more or less dependent on particular psychological frameworks and their relevant vocabularies. For example, the psychoanalytic models of Freud and Jung were dominant in psychiatry in the mid-twentieth century and thus references to ego, repression and the unconscious are commonplace among the psychedelic research literature of this period. While the processes that underlie these constructs may indeed be operative in the context of psychedelics, little effort has been made to define, measure and quantify their contributions (Shagass and Bittle, 1967; Barr et al., 1972). The development of subjective (Nour et al., 2016), behavioral and biological measures (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2016b; Lebedev et al., 2015; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016) relevant to these constructs, and more importantly, the processes that underlie them, would represent an important advance not just for psychedelic science but for the psychological frameworks themselves (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). We should be conscious of not being too attached (or averse) to any specific theoretical frameworks however, and approaches that endeavor to access “framework-free” descriptions of phenomena may prove particularly useful in this regard (Varela, 1996; Petitmengin, 2006). Critically, it is our view that it is possible to work toward a secular, biologically-informed account of the mystical-type experience that does not resort to “explaining away” or “reducing down” the core phenomenology and depth psychology may be a useful bedfellow in this regard. Returning to the present study's main findings, DED was found to negatively correlate with clinical outcome, yet, none of the patients showed a worsening of clinical symptoms at 5 weeks. Less DED combined with high OBN predicted 54% of the variance of clinical change at 5 weeks—a substantial contribution and one that helps justify the emphasis placed on minimizing anxiety and relinquishing psychological resistance in psychedelic therapy (Eisner and Cohen, 1958; Sherwood et al., 1962; Grof et al., 2008; Richards, 2015), as well as paying careful attention to preparation and “set and setting” (Hartogsohn, 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., in press). That anxiety arises in parallel with psychological struggle is resonant with principles of psychoanalytic theory (Sandison, 1961), as can be seen in the choice of terms for the “DED” and “OBN” factors of the ASC—both of which invoke constructs that can be traced to Freud (1929, 1962). According to psychoanalytic theory, the overcoming of psychological resistance is required for emotional breakthrough and insight (Freud, 1920) and the occurrence of mystical-type/peak experiences (Jung, 2014). Consistently, writers on the mystical-type/peak experience have reliably identified loss of self or “ego-dissolution” as one of its basic pre-requisites and features (James, 1902; Stace, 1960; Maslow, 1964). Recent work has sought to develop and validate a measure that is sensitive to difficult or challenging psychedelic experiences (Barrett et al., 2016; Carbonaro et al., 2016) and there is some evidence that the intensity of such experiences is predictive of positive long-term outcomes, whereas the duration of struggle is predictive of negative outcomes (Carbonaro et al., 2016). This is presumably because the successful resolution of conflict brings with it, insight and relief, whereas the failure to breakthrough perpetuates suffering. ASC and other questionnaires such as the challenging experience questionnaire (CEQ) (Barrett et al., 2016) may be insensitive to whether or not successful resolution of psychological conflict has occurred. Therefore, the development of new scales specifically designed to focus on emotional breakthrough after struggle may add considerable value. Improving our subjective measures of high-level human experiences such as the mystical-type/peak experience will enhance our ability to understand their psychology and underlying neural substrates. As touched on in the introduction, psychopharmacology is increasingly acknowledging the importance of “context” and particularly “environment” as a factor mediating the effects of both intrinsic neurobiological features (e.g., genotypes) and exogenous pharmacological inputs—such as drugs (Alexander et al., 1981; Caspi et al., 2010). For example, a recent popular model of the action of SSRIs incorporates “environment” and cognitive (re)appraisal (Harmer et al., 2017) as key determinants of therapeutic efficacy (see also Branchi, 2011; Belsky, 2016). Like SSRIs, classic psychedelic drugs also work on the serotonin system; however, unlike the SSRIs, they are direct agonists at the 5-HT2A receptor (Nichols, 2016). There is compelling evidence that the 5-HT2A receptor is psychedelics' key site of action (Nichols, 2016). Intriguingly, recent work has found that the phenotypic expression of 5-HT2AR genotypes is significantly dependent on the influence of “environment” (Jokela et al., 2007). These findings may imply that enhanced sensitivity to context is an important function of 5-HT2A receptor signaling (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017). Ascending from the pharmacological to the whole-brain systems level, increased cortical entropy has been found to be a reliable feature of the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), to relate to high-level subjective experiences such as “ego-dissolution” (Nour et al., 2016; Atasoy et al., 2017; Schartner et al., 2017) that are relevant to the mystical-type experience, and to be predictive of longer-term trait changes—such as increased “openness” (Lebedev et al., 2016). Recent work suggests that increased brain entropy under psychedelics is consistent with the brain being more closely tuned to “criticality” (Atasoy et al., 2017). Criticality refers to systems that reside in a functional “sweet spot”, critically poised between order and disorder—in which they can effectively retain information (by being sufficiently ordered) while being appropriately adaptive and sensitive to change (by being sufficiently disordered). Intriguingly, one of the signatures of a critical system is a sensitivity to perturbation (Bak, 1996). It follows that enhanced sensitivity to perturbation in a psychedelically-induced “entropic” and “critical” brain may account for the special sensitivity to “environment” that is characteristic of the psychedelic state (Hartogsohn, 2016; Carhart-Harris et al., in press). Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of OBN, mystical-type or peak experiences (Vollenweider, 2001) should enable us to better comprehend, define and study them. This is important, not least because they are proving to be important determinants of treatment success in psychedelic therapy (Richards et al., 1977; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). Crucially, better understanding the biological basis of mystical-type/peak experiences and their longer-term impact on the mind and brain should help to demystify them, facilitating an easier conversation about them with mainstream psychology. Researchers in the mainstream have as much a responsibility as those in “the periphery” to facilitate this. Denying the relevance of these phenomena is as damaging to scientific progress as denying their physical basis. The prize for successfully integrating mystical-type experience into mainstream science may be their potential to have a substantial positive impact on medicine, education and society—which ironically, may, at least in part, explain why their integration into western society has proved so difficult to achieve (Stevens, 1987). To summarize, the occurrence of high OBN (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and low DED (relating to anxiety and impaired cognition) under psilocybin predicted positive clinical outcomes in a trial of psilocybin for TRD. This relationship exhibited a degree of specificity, in that psilocybin-induced OBN was significantly more predictive of reduced depressive symptoms than the drug's more generic visual and auditory perceptual effects. Future work, with a larger sample size, is required to more comprehensively and systematically measure the influence of different potential predictive factors on the quality of acute psychedelic experiences (Gasser et al., 2014; Belser et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2017) and subsequent long-term outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., in press). As psychedelic therapy gains influence and credibility (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017), it seems vital that appropriate consideration is paid to the importance of promoting a certain kind of experience, as the quality of that experience may be the critical determinant of therapeutic success.",
15,10.1038/s41598-017-13282-7,"The present study goes some way to addressing an important knowledge gap concerning the post-acute brain effects of serotonergic psychedelics. Its findings suggest that changes in brain activity observed just one-day after a high dose psychedelic experience are very different to those found during the acute psychedelic state. Specifically, whereas the acute psychedelic state in healthy volunteers is characterised by modular disintegration14,15,28 and global integration14,19,29, there are trends towards modular (re)integration and minimal effects on global integration/segregation post psilocybin for depression. Relating the blood flow findings to what has been seen previously in the acute psychedelic state is somewhat more complicated due to inconsistencies in this literature – likely due to analysis approaches and interpretation14,15,30: Here we saw decreased CBF bilaterally in the temporal lobes, including the left amygdala one-day post treatment. Decreased absolute CBF in subcortical and high-level association cortices have been previously reported with intravenous (I.V.)15 and now oral psilocybin30 but increased CBF and metabolism have also been reported with I.V. LSD14, oral psilocybin31, and oral ayahuasca Much recent research has focused on the involvement of the default-mode network in psychiatric disorders33, and particularly depression34,35. We previously observed decreased DMN functional integrity under psilocybin15 and LSD14, and others have with ayahuasca28. Here however, increased DMN integrity was observed one-day post treatment with psilocybin, both via seed (i.e. vmPFC and sgACC) and network-based approaches. Previous work has suggested that increased DMN integrity may be a marker of depressed mood and specifically, depressive rumination34,36. On this basis, increased DMN integrity post psilocybin may be surprising. The post-treatment increases in within-DMN RSFC and sgACC-PCC RSFC did not relate to symptom improvements but vmPFC-ilPC RSFC did (see Fig. 3). This apparent divergence from previous findings36,37 is intriguing, and deserves further discussion (below) It should be noted that findings of elevated within-DMN RSFC in depression are not entirely consistent in the literature38,39,40,41. For example, using a DMN-focused analysis, precuneus-DMN RSFC39 was found to be lower in patients than in healthy controls, and normalised after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - and only in responders39 – consistent with the present findings. Lower precuneus-DMN RSFC in depression was also seen in a separate study and the degree of this abnormality correlated with autobiographical memory deficits40. In another study, lower PCC-dmPFC and PCC-ilPC RSFC were seen in first-episode depressed patients relative to healthy controls41. In the present study, we saw increased within-DMN RSFC post treatment with psilocybin, and increased vmPFC-bilateral ilPC RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5 weeks (Fig. 3). These findings suggest a commonality in the antidepressant action of ECT and psilocybin39 in which DMN integrity is decreased acutely (at least by the latter14,15,28) and increased (or normalised) post-acutely, accompanied by improvements in mood. This process might be likened to a ‘reset’ mechanism in which acute modular disintegration (e.g. in the DMN) enables a subsequent re-integration and resumption of normal functioning Recent meta-analyses of studies of resting-state CBF in depression have yielded relatively mixed results34,42, although findings of increased thalamic34,42 and sgACC metabolism are relatively consistent34. Here, we did not find any post-treatment changes in thalamic or sgACC CBF with psilocybin, either in whole-brain or ROI-based analyses. We did observe decreased CBF bilaterally in the temporal cortex however, including the left medial temporal lobe and specifically, the left amygdala. Given previous findings of elevated resting-state amygdala CBF and metabolism in mood disorders25,43,44, the reduction in amygdala CBF observed here, and its relation to symptom severity, could be viewed as a possible remediation effect. Moreover, generalised decreases in CBF are (again) consistent with what has been previously reported with ECT45, i.e. most studies have documented an increase in CBF in the acute ‘ictal’ state, including in the amygdala45; however, the post-ictal period is characterised by decreased CBF, and often in those regions that were most perfused during seizure45. Acutely increased CBF has previously been reported with ayahuasca32 and LSD15 and increased glucose metabolism has been observed in the acute state with oral31 but not I.V. psilocybin15. Thus, a post-acute reversal of acute increases in CBF could be seen as consistent with the post-treatment ‘reset’ mechanism proposed above – although recent work has laid into question whether oral psilocybin does indeed cause increases in brain absolute CBF30. It would be challenging (but not impossible) to carry out acute and post-acute imaging in future trials of psilocybin for depression, and this may be necessary if the ‘reset’ model is to be properly tested. In such a study, we would advise focusing on BOLD RSFC (and perhaps simultaneous EEG-related measures) rather than CBF, due to RSFC and EEG offering more direct and reliable indices of brain activity and function than more difficult to interpret measures such as CBF. The inclusion of a healthy control group, exposed to a consistent treatment procedure, would further strengthen the design of such a study, as would the inclusion of a placebo and/or active comparator arm The present study’s other major positive finding was a decrease in RSFC between the bilateral parahippocampus and the PFC, an effect that (like increased vmPFC-ilPC RSFC) was predictive of treatment response at 5 weeks. Curiously, a post-hoc exploratory analysis suggested that acute ‘peak’ or ‘mystical-type’ experiences under psilocybin may mediate the post-acute changes in parahippocampal RSFC (including decreased PH-PCC RSFC). Focusing on parahippocampal-PFC RSFC, this has generally been found to be elevated in depression46, and consistently so across the duration of a resting-state scan47. Prefrontal-limbic circuitry has been linked with top-down suppression of affective responsiveness48 and lower resting-state amygdala-vmPFC RSFC in combination with amygdala hyperfusion was found to relate to state-anxiety in healthy individuals43, corroborating separate findings49. Seven days of citalopram has been found to reduce amygdala-vmPFC50 and dorso-medial PFC-left hippocampal RSFC51 in healthy volunteers, somewhat consistent with the present findings In conclusion, here we document for the first time, changes in resting-state brain blood flow and functional connectivity post-treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Decreased blood flow was found to correlate (in the amygdala) with reductions in depressive mood. Increased within-DMN RSFC was observed post-treatment, using both seed and network-based analyses, and specific increases in RSFC between the vmPFC and bilateral ilPC nodes of the DMN were greatest in individuals who maintained treatment-response at 5 weeks. Finally, decreased PH-PFC RSFC was observed post-treatment and this was also predictive of treatment-response at 5 weeks. An exploratory post-hoc analysis revealed that acute ‘peak’ or ‘mystical’ experience during the high-dose psilocybin session was predictive of these changes in PH RSFC This study is limited by its small sample size and absence of a control condition. Moreover, correction for multiple testing was applied to the full RSN but not the specific (hypothesis-based) ROI analyses. Future research with more rigorous controls should serve to challenge and develop the present study’s findings and inferences. Assessing the relative contributions of, and potential interactions between, the different treatment factors (e.g. the drug and the accompanying psychological support) may be a particularly informative next step.",
16,10.1038/npp.2017.84,"The unspoken assumption, which I think we both share, is that the use of psilocybin at this stage requires a medical justification. Certainly, it started in western society as a putative aid to psychotherapy, but of course, it has an older cultural history as a constituent of magic mushrooms. Many believed and believe that the justification for the use of such drugs lies in their capacity to open the doors of perception, as Aldous Huxley put it. On this view, access to such drugs should be a recreational right, like access to alcohol, cigarettes, and increasingly cannabis. As with cannabis, medical use may be expected to promote wider discretionary use for any reason. Some may still regard this as a red light for the development of medical indications However, there is an important corollary to the continuing illegal status of psychedelics. It seems to me paradoxical, even incredible, that such drugs should not be available for medical use in conditions for which euthanasia is already available. In Belgium, neuropsychiatric disorders were first reported under euthanasia legislation in 2004/5. Of the first such 100 patients considered for euthanasia between 2007 and 2011, 58 had depression. Forty-eight of the total were accepted for euthanasia (35 completed) and six others had died by suicide within 12 months from the end of the study. Most patients were female, aged 40–60 years. Euthanasia for psychological suffering is similarly available in the Netherlands and Luxemburg (Thienpont et al, 2015) So, I think we need psilocybin in medicine but we should not forget the failures of human logic, which mean we need high-quality clinical trials","Our shared interest in the development of psychedelics, and particularly psilocybin, for medical use is a major point of convergence. There may be a subtle difference in our views of the so-called ‘mystical’ elements of the psychedelic experience, ie, both of us see the term ‘mystical’ as problematic—but whereas GMG views the acute ‘psychedelic experience’ as irrelevant to the clinical development of psychedelics, RLC-H sees it as a potentially exploitable component—especially as it has been shown to be predictive of long-term clinical outcomes (eg, in Johnson et al, 2014; Bogenschutz et al, 2015; Griffiths et al, 2016; Ross et al, 2016; Carhart-Harris et al, 2016a, b). Perhaps the most notable point of divergence, however, relates to the choice of patient population for the clinical development of psilocybin for depression. For GMG, the most obvious and relevant unmet need is treatment-resistant depression (see below), and while RLC-H accepts that treatment resistance is often the first port-of-call for the development of a novel intervention, he feels that unipolar depression more generally, will prove a better indication for this treatment. In his view, psilocybin will be safest, most effective, and easiest to implement, prior to the treatment-resistant stage of illness Focusing on treatment-resistant depression for the moment, however, we both recognize that a significant number of patients treated first line with either a SSRI or CBT fail to respond adequately (Gaynes, 2009). Persisting symptoms lead to enduring chronicity of depression, and there is no consensus in existing guidelines on what to do next. Moreover, the efficacy of secondary intervention is often modest and new medications can introduce new side effects. The duration of distress with TRD and its economic impact are considerable. We agree that TRD represents a valid point in the treatment pathway, where a single psychedelic intervention might find a place; however, RLC-H questions whether patients must wait until their depression is significantly stamped-in before psilocybin can be considered, and based on the speed and duration of treatment responses seen in the trials listed above, it seems reasonable to ask whether early intervention with psilocybin could be prophylactic—and there is also the issue of SSRIs obstructing the potential therapeutic action of psilocybin If it is to be TRD, however, then patient recruitment can be based on pre-existing criteria (Sackeim, 2001) and patients meeting them will not be rare and should not be excessively treatment resistant. As noted earlier, there is a significant challenge to the issue of continuing medication, most commonly with SSRIs. There is anecdotal evidence that psychedelic effects are largely attenuated by ongoing treatment with SSRIs (Bonson et al, 1996) and perhaps with other antidepressants (Bonson and Murphy, 1996). Downregulation of 5-HT2A receptors is a feature of many different first-line antidepressant drugs (Muguruza et al, 2014), as well as second-line antidepressant medications (eg, atypical antipsychotics) with significant 5-HT2AR antagonist properties (Gray and Roth, 2001). Any trial would ideally be conducted in patients withdrawn from such drugs for at least 2 weeks or so, but we accept that this is not always straightforward Moving on from questions of the optimal patient population, both of us can see merit in a multiple dose trial comparing, for example, 1, 10 and 25 mg of psilocybin. Such a design seems to overcome some of the problems any trial of a psychedelic will face. The ethical problem of equipoise seems satisfactory because we really do not know which dose, if any, will be effective, and patients can enter the study knowing that whatever group they are allocated to, they will receive active drug. The omission of a strict placebo control would be pragmatic in this sense, as expectation and preparation would be standardized. We know the highest dose of psilocybin will likely unblind participants and the expectation of a possible placebo would complicate recruitment. An approximation to an inert placebo condition may be met with the 1 mg psilocybin arm, as such a dose is likely too low to produce appreciable subjective or physiological effects (Griffiths et al, 2016). The differences between a dose mainly producing perceptual distortion (10 mg) and one more capable of producing the more profound, putatively ‘transformative’ aspects of the psychedelic experience (25 mg) is also of scientific and clinical interest Comparing mechanisms and/or efficacy with an established treatment would be a next step to advance the evidence base for psilocybin for TRD. For example, psilocybin could be compared with ketamine since it has some similarities: rapid, single-dose efficacy, and obvious subjective effects during its infusion. Psilocybin’s distinctive subjective effects and the implications of this for blinding would still remain a major challenge; moreover, as with ketamine, there will also remain the question of how much an acute response is sustained and whether a maintenance dose may be required The traditional view of the mechanism, whereby psilocybin works, emphasizes the importance of accompanying psychotherapy (Johnson et al, 2008; Richards, 2015). Accordingly, psychedelics administered without psychological support and/or a supportive environment may have limited antidepressant efficacy, and in very rare cases, could even worsen a patient’s condition (Oram, 2014). We share the view that the presence of psychological support is an essential component of the psychedelic treatment model (Johnson et al, 2008) but we also recognize that the magnitude and nature of its contribution needs to be better defined and tested Pragmatically, we accept that minimizing the active psychological work of the therapy would be desirable (eg, therapy time is expensive) and scientifically, doing so would allow drug effects and dose to be better identified. Critically however, any such therapy minimization should not be allowed to jeopardize patient safety (Johnson et al, 2008). A future challenge will be to learn how psychological interventions can maximize the advantages of the psychedelic state. For example, we can imagine how cognitive therapy, attentional-bias training and/or de-sensitization could be investigated with or without psilocybin assistance In other respects, a psilocybin trial is easier to conduct than studies requiring continuing adherence to a daily oral dose of an antidepressant. Exposure to the treatment can be completely controlled and follow-up can be relatively pragmatic. It seems logical to determine an early proximal end point to prove initial impact of treatment and then to follow subsequent illness course as comprehensively as possible. In this way, we will be able to determine time to supplementary treatment, document recovery of symptoms and function, and perhaps objectify improvement using a simple frictionless measure of activity-like geolocation (Palmius et al, 2016) In the short term, there will also be a need to demonstrate cost effectiveness. The requirement for psychological support and/or a supportive environment could be a major limitation of the psychedelic treatment model. However, direct medical costs need to be netted off against the social and economic costs of illness In summary, a door has been opened for the medical repurposing of psychedelics. The possibility exists that drugs like psilocybin can meet a major unmet need in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. For GMG, treatment-resistant depression is the most logical place to start because of the uncertainty around the choice of next-step treatment after an SSRI fails, and while RLC-H accepts this (Carhart-Harris et al, 2016a, b), he looks forward to a time when an individual may receive psilocybin before the ruts of depression are allowed to deepen (Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011). Regardless of who the ‘right’ patient population might be eventually, a key challenge now is to design the optimal trial to demonstrate efficacy, agree its validity with regulatory authorities and fund it."
17,10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.04.005,"Our data show that psilocybin biases emotional processing toward positive relative to negative information, an effect that is consistent across different psychological domains. Specifically, psilocybin first enhanced positive mood states; second, decreased recognition of negative facial expression; and third, increased behavior toward positive relative to negative cues. In contrast to these generalized effects of the serotonergic agonist psilocybin, a more specific role for 5-HT2A receptors in elevating mood and attenuating the recognition of negative facial expression is indicated by the finding that the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin blocked these psilocybin-induced effects Psilocybin predominantly enhanced positive mood states, as evidenced by the marked increase in the positive affect but not negative affect subscale scores of the PANAS questionnaire, as well as by the increase in blissful but not anxiety subscale scores of the 5D-ASC questionnaire. These strong effects of psilocybin on mood contrasts with the usually lacking acute mood effects of drugs that modulate the serotonergic tone such as acute tryptophan depletion (30, 35, 54) or SSRI administration (31, 32, 55). This apparent disparity suggests that a specific activation of certain 5-HT subreceptors is necessary to acutely enhance mood. Indeed, the finding that the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin blocked the mood-enhancing effects of psilocybin suggests that 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in regulating positive mood states. Moreover, we argue that the additional stimulation of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C receptors by psilocybin is rather unlikely to contribute to the mood effects of psilocybin, because ketanserin has nearly no affinity to 5-HT1A receptors and about fiftyfold higher affinity to 5-HT2A compared with 5-HT2C receptors (National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program: http://pdsp.med.unc.edu). Furthermore, the serotonin 2B/5-HT2C agonist meta-chlorphenylpiperazin induces anxiety rather than positive mood states (56). Finally, it is unlikely that expectation of receiving psilocybin considerably contributed to the mood effects, because various drug combinations were administrated in a double-blind procedure and subjects were instructed that the psychological effects of psilocybin vary largely between and within subjects Serotonin 2A receptors appear also to be crucially involved in the recognition of negative facial expressions, because ketanserin blocked psilocybin-induced attenuation in recognizing negative emotional states from the eye region of human faces. This finding is in line with the central role of serotonin in emotional facial recognition as previously established by pharmacologic (29, 30, 31, 32, 33) and genetic studies (57) but extends this notion by showing that specific activation of 5-HT2A receptors likely biases facial recognition away from negative emotion. This mechanism might also contribute to the attenuated recognition of negative facial expression as previously observed after a single dose of MDMA (33) and after chronic administration of SSRIs (29, 58), because MDMA has a moderate affinity at 5-HT2A receptors (59) and chronic SSRI administration changes 5-HT2A receptor density (60, 61) In the emotional go/nogo task, psilocybin enhanced the response bias toward positive relative to neutral and negative emotional stimuli, which was evidenced at the behavioral level by the psilocybin-induced increase in reaction times to negative and neutral compared with positive stimuli. In addition, this response bias was modulated by the sequential context of the stimuli across all drug conditions, an effect that was augmented by psilocybin administration. That is, across all drug conditions, sequential repetition of positive and neutral stimuli facilitated processing (62, 63), as indicated by decreased reaction times to positive and neutral stimuli. Interestingly, this sequential facilatory effect was lacking after negative stimuli, a finding that has not yet been reported in emotional go/nogo tasks but was previously observed in semantic (64, 65) and negative affective priming tasks (66, 67, 68). Given that this lacking facilitation has been interpreted as an inhibition of negative concepts within the attentional (66) or memory system (65) and that psilocybin prolonged reaction time for repeated negative stimuli but decreased it for repeated positive stimuli, psilocybin may also increase inhibition of negative relative to positive concepts in the attentional or memory system Support for such a psilocybin-induced shift in the attentional system was revealed by the effect of psilocybin on event-related potentials. The event-related potentials analysis indicated that across all drug conditions, the word valence affected early and late response selection, inhibition, and attention processes as indexed by the decreased N2 and enhanced P3 component for emotional relative to neutral stimuli (69, 70). Most importantly, while psilocybin and ketanserin did not modulate these valence-specific effects during the N2 time range, psilocybin strongly decreased the P300 component in all valence conditions and particularly for negative and neutral stimuli. Because this valence-dependent P300 decrease was equally present in both the go and nogo conditions, it is conceivable that this psilocybin-induced change in emotional processing is neither specific for response selection (go) nor specific for inhibition (nogo) but rather reflects a more general process underlying the P300. For instance, the P300 amplitude is strongly modulated by the amount of attentional resource allocation (71), and several behavioral studies previously showed that psilocybin attenuates attentional performance (41, 72, 73). This suggests, on the one hand, that the strong psilocybin-induced decrease of the P300 seen across all valence conditions might reflect an important electrophysiological index of the previously reported psilocybin-induced attentional deficits. On the other hand, the small valence-dependent decrease suggests that psilocybin may attenuate the allocation of attentional resources to neutral and negative stimuli more strongly than to positive stimuli, which results in a relative positive attentional bias Contrary to the crucial contribution of 5-HT2A receptors in modulating mood states and emotional face recognition, the psilocybin-induced relative bias toward the processing of positive emotions in the go/nogo task were not blocked by pretreatment with ketanserin. Thus, the psilocybin-induced emotional bias might rather be due to a stimulation of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C receptors than 5-HT2A receptors. However, the strong valence-independent reduction of the P300 seen after psilocybin administration was partially reversed by ketanserin, indicating an involvement of 5-HT2A receptors in the valence-independent attentional performance In the present study, psilocybin produced behavioral and electrophysiological effects that were opposite to the dysfunctional emotional processing bias seen in depressed subjects in emotional facial recognition (1, 29, 30, 31), goal-directed behavior (2, 3, 70), and mood states. For example, in the emotional go/nogo task, psilocybin increased RTs and decreased P300 amplitudes, particulary for negative and neutral stimuli, while depressed subjects were delayed in responding to positive cues (2, 3) and displayed increased P300 component for negative stimuli (70). Thus, it appears that psilocybin may have the potential to acutely shift dysfunctional emotional biases in depression. Such an acute shift might, in conjunction with the reported effect of psilocybin on neuroplastic factors (24), lead to sustained adaptations and may therefore account for the discussed antidepressive potential of psilocybin-like compounds (24, 28). Hence, further studies using different and multiple doses of psilocybin are indicated to explore whether the effect of psilocybin on emotional biases are dose-dependent and whether psilocybin may shift the negative emotional biases seen in depression Furthermore, here we identify 5-HT2A receptor activity as a potential crucial pharmacologic target in the treatment of negative mood states and negative emotional facial recognition bias. In line with this finding, negative mood is associated with pessimistic attitudes (74) and medication-free major depression patients with high pessimistic attitudes have increased 5-HT2A receptor binding in the prefrontal cortex compared with healthy control subjects (8, 9, 10). Furthermore, chronic administration of SSRIs not only shifts negative mood states and negative bias in facial recognition in depressed patients (29, 58) but also seems to normalize alterations in 5-HT2A receptor densities in depressed subjects (60, 61). In summary, the present study indicates that the assessment of the effects of psilocybin provides a valuable framework to identify neuropsychopharmacologic mechanisms underlying dysfunctional emotional biases and the putative antidepressant effects of psilocybin and related compounds.",
18,10.1017/S0033291718001356,"We found evidence of rapid antidepressant effect after a single dosing session with ayahuasca when compared with placebo. Depression severity changed significantly but differently for the ayahuasca and placebo groups. Improvements in the psychiatric scales in the ayahuasca group were significantly higher than those of the placebo group at all time points after dosing, with increasing between-group effect sizes from D1 to D7. Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2 and were significantly higher in the ayahuasca group at D7. Between-groups remission rate showed a trend toward significance at D7 The within-group effect size found for ayahuasca at D7 (Cohen's d = 2.22) is compatible with our earlier open-label study (Cohen's d at D7 = 1.83) and compatible with the one found in a recent open-label trial with psilocybin for depression Our results are comparable with randomized controlled trials that used ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Although both ketamine and ayahuasca are associated with rapid antidepressant effects, their response time-courses and mechanisms of action seem to differ. Previous studies with ketamine have found the largest between-group effect size at D1 (Cohen's d = 0.89), reducing toward D7 In contrast, the effect sizes observed herein were large, but smallest, at D1 (Cohen's d = 0.84), and largest at D7 (Cohen's d = 1.49). These differences are also reflected in the response rates. At D1, the response rate to ketamine lies between 37 and 70%, whereas in our study 50% of the patients responded to ayahuasca. At D7, the ketamine response rate ranges between 7 and 35% while in our study 64% responded to ayahuasca. The placebo effect was high in our study, and higher than most studies with. While we find a response rate to placebo of 46% at D1, and 26% at D7, ketamine trials have found a placebo effect of the order of 0–6% at D1, and 0–11% at D7 Several factors may account for the high placebo effect observed herein. First, the higher placebo effect has been found in patients with low socioeconomic status which was the case of our study. Most patients were living under significant psychosocial stressors, and during our trial, they stayed at a ‘very comfortable and very supportive environment’, as reported by the patients themselves. Therefore, part of the increased placebo effects found in our study might be due to this ‘care effect’. Second, patients with comorbid personality disorders present higher placebo responses and in our study, most patients (76%) also suffered from personality disorders, most of them in cluster B. A growing body of evidence gives support to the observed rapid antidepressant effects of ayahuasca For instance, sigma-1 receptors (σ1R) have been implicated in depression, and it was reported to be activated by N, N-DMT Moreover, it has been shown that the administration of σ1R agonists results in antidepressant-like effects, which are blocked by σ1R antagonism Furthermore, σ1R upregulates neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), proteins whose regulation and expression seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that antidepressants with σ1R agonist profile do not present clinically significant antidepressant effect. For instance, the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity for σ1R do not present response rates compatible to that was found herein The effects observed might be in part due to the presence of MAOi in the brew. In fact, studies in animal models reported that chronic administration of harmine reduces immobility time, increases climbing and swimming time, reverses anhedonia, increases adrenal gland weight, and increases BDNF levels in the hippocampus All of these are compatible with antidepressant effects. Likewise, harmine seems to stimulate neurogenesis of human neural progenitor cells, derived from pluripotent stem cells and progenitor cells from adult mice brains a mechanism also observed in rodents following antidepressant treatment. In addition, a recent study in rodents found that a single ayahuasca dose increases swimming time in a forced-swim test Brain circuits modulated by psychedelics show great overlap with those involved in mood disorders We recently found that a single ayahuasca session in patients with depression increases blood flow in brain regions consistently implicated in the regulation of mood and emotions, such as the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area Moreover, we have shown that ayahuasca reduces the activity of the Default Mode NetworkOver the last two decades, mental health evaluations of regular ayahuasca consumers have shown preserved cognitive function, increased well-being, reduction of anxiety, and depressive symptoms when compared to non-ayahuasca consumers Moreover, a recent study observed that a single dose of ayahuasca enhanced mindfulness-related capacities and meditation practices have been associated with antidepressant effects Prior studies suggest that elements of the psychedelic experience, such as experiences of mystical-type, account for the therapeutic benefit We found significant increased MEQ30 scores during the effects of ayahuasca. We also observed an inverse correlation between MADRS score changes at D7 with ‘transcendence of time and space’ MEQ30 factor Furthermore, HRS dimensions seem important to the clinical outcome, particularly perception a subscale that comprehends changes in visual, auditory, and body sensations. Visions are common during the effects of ayahuasca, and are most frequent with the eyes closed It has been suggested that visions may play an important role in the therapeutic effect of ayahuasca, as they may help bringing clarity to introspective events It is interesting to observe that changes in perception taken alone are not sufficient to predict the positive clinical outcome, as for instance, we find that some patients presented increased scores in ‘perception’ without significant clinical response No serious adverse events were observed during or after dosing. Although 100% of the patients reported feeling safe, the ayahuasca session was not necessarily a pleasant experience. In fact, some patients reported the opposite, as the experience was accompanied by much psychological distress. Most patients reported nausea, and about 57% have vomited, although vomiting is traditionally not considered a side effect of ayahuasca, but rather part of a purging process Although promising, this study has some caveats and limitations worth mentioning. The number of participants is modest, and therefore randomized trials in larger populations are necessary. The study was limited to patients with treatment-resistant depression, with a long course of illness, and high comorbid personality disorder, which altogether precludes a simple extension of these results to other classes of depression. Another challenge of the research with psychedelics is maintaining double blindness, as the effects of psychedelics are unique. We were particularly keen to ensure blindness throughout the entire experiment, and to that end, we adopted a series of additional measures to preserve blindness. All patients were naïve to ayahuasca, with no previous experience with any other psychedelic substance. Clinical evaluations involved a team of five psychiatrists. For every patient, one psychiatrist was responsible for clinical evaluation during the dosing session and a different one for the follow-up assessments. The substance used as placebo increased anxiety and induced nausea. In fact, five patients misclassified placebo as ayahuasca, and two of them showed a response at D7 (online Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, we believe blindness was adequately preserved in our study Since the prohibition of psychedelics in the late 1960s, research with these substances has almost come to a halt. Before research restrictions, psychedelics were at early stage testing for many psychiatric conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcohol dependence. By mid-1960s, over 40.000 subjects had participated in clinical research with psychedelics, most of them in uncontrolled settings (Vollenweider and Kometer, To our knowledge, this is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial to investigate the antidepressant potential of a psychedelic in a population of patients with treatment-resistant depression. Overall, this study brings new evidence supporting the safety and therapeutic value of psychedelics, dosed within an appropriate setting, to help treat depression.",
19,10.1177/2045125316638008,"The mechanisms of action responsible for the beneficial effects produced by ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD are not completely understood. Preclinical evidence show that ayahuasca [Lima et al. 2006; Pic-Taylor et al. 2015] and its β-carbolines harmine [Aricioglu-Kartal et al. 2003; Farzin and Mansouri, 2006; Fortunato et al. 2009, 2010a, 2010b; Réus et al. 2010, 2012; Brierley and Davidson, 2012; Owaisat et al. 2012] and harmaline [Glick et al. 1994; Hilber and Chapillon, 2005; Wu et al. 2009], as well as psilocybin [Matsushima et al. 2009] and LSD [Zghoul and Blier, 2003; Buchborn et al. 2014], have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Experimental studies with healthy volunteers report that acute administration of DMT [Gillin et al. 1976; Strassman et al. 1994; Riba et al. 2015], psilocybin [Griffiths et al. 2006, 2011; Studerus et al. 2011; Kometer et al. 2012; Kraehenmann et al. 2016], and LSD [Schmid et al. 2016] increase positive mood. Furthermore, observational and preliminary experimental studies of ayahuasca consumers [Grob et al. 1996; Barbosa et al. 2005, 2009, 2012; da Silveira et al. 2005; Doering-Silveira et al. 2005; dos Santos et al. 2007, 2016; Halpern et al. 2008; Labate et al. 2009, 2014; Fábregas et al. 2010; Labate and Jungaberle, 2011; Bouso et al. 2012; dos Santos, 2013; Thomas et al. 2013; Bouso and Riba, 2014; Fernández and Fábregas, 2014; Fernández et al. 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Loizaga Pazzi, 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Verres, 2014; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2014; Winkelman, 2014], as well as case reports [Leonard and Rapoport, 1987; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Hanes, 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Perrine, 1999; Wilcox, 2014] and observational studies [Krebs and Johansen, 2013; Hendricks et al. 2014, 2015; Johansen and Krebs, 2015] involving psilocybin and LSD, also suggest that these drugs have therapeutic potentials Since DMT, psilocybin and LSD are agonists of serotonin 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors [Pierce and Peroutka, 1989; McKenna et al. 1990; Glennon et al. 2000; Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Nichols, 2004; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013; Tylš et al. 2014; Halberstadt, 2015], these receptors may be involved in the therapeutic effects of these tryptamines. In fact, cortical expression of 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor is altered in post-mortem samples of depressed patients, suggesting that these receptors are involved in emotional processing [Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Baumeister et al. 2014]. Furthermore, animal models and clinical studies show that 5-HT1A receptor agonists have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties [Nutt, 2005; Katzman, 2009; Baumeister et al. 2014], and 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists reduce anxiety- and depression-related behavior in animals [Masuda and Sugiyama, 2000; Nic Dhonnchadha et al. 2003a, 2003b; Baumeister et al. 2014] Another possible mechanism of therapeutic action is the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission induced by 5-HT2A-receptor agonism [Nichols, 2004; González-Maeso et al. 2008; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Moreno et al. 2011, 2013; Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013; Santini et al. 2014; Buchborn et al. 2015; Carbonaro et al. 2015; Halberstadt, 2015]. Activation of frontocortical glutamate networks by 5-HT2A receptor agonists could lead to increases in the expression of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and in the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, thus enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis [Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Ross, 2012; Baumeister et al. 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. For instance, depression is associated with deficient neurogenesis and neurotrophic activity, and BDNF levels are decreased in depressed patients and normalized after antidepressant treatment [Baumeister et al. 2014]. Furthermore, alcohol self-administration and conditioned place preference are inversely related to BDNF or GDNF expression in animal models [Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. Interestingly, a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of psilocybin produced a trend toward increased neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus 2 weeks after its administration, while a high dose (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurogenesis [Catlow et al. 2013]. These results suggest that the effects of psilocybin on neurogenesis are dose- and time-related Agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor could also produce beneficial effects due to an anti-inflammatory action [Nau et al. 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; dos Santos, 2014; Szabo et al. 2014]. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-1β are associated with depressive illness, while normalization of these levels are related to antidepressant effects [Baumeister et al. 2014; Réus et al. 2015]. The 5-HT2A receptor is expressed in central and peripheral immune-related cells [Stefulj et al. 2000; Nau et al. 2013], and 5-HT2A agonists may modulate the immune system [Forrer and Goldner, 1951; Feld et al. 1958; Sackler et al. 1963, 1966; Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964; House et al. 1994, 1997; Stefulj et al. 2000; Passie et al. 2002; Davydova et al. 2010; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; dos Santos et al. 2011, 2012; Frecska et al. 2013; Nau et al. 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; dos Santos, 2014; Szabo et al. 2014]. Indeed, in vitro studies show that LSD inhibits the production of IL-6 [House et al. 1994, 1997], and the serotonergic hallucinogen 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl-isopropylamine (DOI, a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) produces anti-inflammatory effects in mice by blocking TNF-α-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cell adhesion (Icam-1, Vcam-1), cytokine (IL-6, IL-1β), and chemokine (Mcp-1, Cx3cl1) genes, and expression of VCAM-1 protein [Nau et al. 2013]. These effects were blocked by a 5-HT2A selective antagonist, implicating this receptor in the anti-inflammatory effects of DOI Moreover, DMT and the related tryptamine 5-methoxy-DMT (5-MeO-DMT) reduced the mRNA expression and the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α, increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and inhibited the immune responses of inflammatory T helper 1/17 (Th1/Th17) cells [Szabo et al. 2014]. Interestingly, gene knock-down experiments showed that the effects of both tryptamines on TNFα, IL-10, and Th1/Th17 responses were mediated by the sigma-1 receptor, and recent studies show that DMT is an endogenous agonist for the sigma-1 receptor [Fontanilla et al. 2009; Su et al. 2009; Frecska et al. 2013; Szabo et al. 2014] The possible modulation of the sigma-1 receptor by DMT shows that other mechanisms of action that are not dependent of the 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors may also be involved in the therapeutic action of classic hallucinogens. For instance, harmine, THH and harmaline reversibly inhibit MAO-A [Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977; McKenna et al. 1984; Ott, 1994, 1999, 2004; Riba et al. 2001, 2003; McKenna and Riba, 2016], and reversible inhibitors of MAO-A (RIMAs) are clinically used as anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs [Yamada and Yasuhara, 2004; Nutt, 2005]. Moreover, rodent studies show that the antidepressive effects of harmine are associated with increases in BDNF levels [Fortunato et al. 2009; 2010a; 2010b] Neural oxidative stress and subsequent neuroinflammation are associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression [Réus et al. 2015], and several preclinical studies show that harmine and harmaline have antioxidant and neuroprotective effects that seem to be mediated by MAO inhibition [Maher and Davis, 1996; Biradar et al. 2013], regulation of the dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase DYRK1A [Frost et al. 2011], modulation of dopaminergic [Lee et al. 2000; Schwarz et al. 2003], cholinergic [Biradar et al. 2013], and glutamatergic [Maher and Davis, 1996; Li et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2014] pathways, interaction with voltage-gated membrane channels [Splettstoesser et al. 2005], and regulation of cell-energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxygen free radical scavenging [Moura et al. 2007; Réus et al. 2010, 2012; Abelaira et al. 2013]. Furthermore, harmine also has anti-inflammatory properties that seem to be mediated at least in part by DYRK1A [Khor et al. 2015] The antiaddictive effects of ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD could also be related to the activation of the dopaminergic system. For instance, preclinical studies show that LSD [Nichols, 2004; Passie et al. 2008; Hintzen and Passie, 2010], psilocybin [Tylš et al. 2014; Sakashita et al. 2015], and ayahuasca [de Castro-Neto et al. 2013] may indirectly stimulate dopaminergic pathways, probably through 5-HT2A-receptor activation (LSD, psilocybin, and DMT) or MAO inhibition (β-carbolines). Moreover, acute psilocybin administration indirectly increased (through 5-HT1A/2A receptors) the release of dopamine in the ventral striatum in humans [Vollenweider et al. 1999]. Animal studies suggest that the antiaddictive potentials of harmine and harmaline appear to involve imidazoline, glutamate, and dopamine pathways [Glick et al. 1994; Iurlo et al. 2001; Aricioglu-Kartal et al. 2003; Schwarz et al. 2003; Brierley and Davidson, 2012, 2013; Owaisat et al. 2012] Recent neuroimaging studies in humans suggest that the mood-enhancing properties of ayahuasca and psilocybin could be related to modifications in the activity of brain regions such as the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), involved in emotional processing, and the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain regions associated with introspection and other internally focused functions [Riba et al. 2006; Araujo et al. 2012; Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2014; Tagliazucchi et al. 2014; Bouso et al. 2015; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; Alonso et al. 2015; Kraehenmann et al. 2016; McKenna and Riba, 2016]. Psilocybin reduced amygdala reactivity, which correlated with increases in positive mood [Kraehenmann et al. 2016]. Increased activity of the DMN is associated with intensification of the self-reference process of rumination, which is an important depressive symptom, and acute administration of ayahuasca [Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015] and psilocybin [Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a] reduces brain activity in key regions of the DMN, such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Moreover, regular ayahuasca use is associated with cortical thinning in the PCC [Bouso et al. 2015] Early human research with classical hallucinogens suggests that the therapeutic properties of these compounds are related at least in part to their effects on perceptions, emotions, and thoughts [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. The subjective experience produced by these drugs would create a ‘window of opportunity’ in which changes in unhealthy thoughts, emotions, and behaviors could take place in a psychotherapeutic context [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. Recent neuroimaging studies with ayahuasca and psilocybin seem to corroborate these early ideas by suggesting that the altered state of consciousness produced by these drugs would create a disruption or interruption of the repetitive, rigid, and pathological pattern of negative and compulsive thoughts present in anxiety and mood disorders and in drug dependence, contributing to mental flexibility and changes in perspective, values, and behavior [Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2014; Tagliazucchi et al. 2014; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; McKenna and Riba, 2016] Furthermore, the ability of classical hallucinogens to elicit religious, mystical, transcendent, or peak experiences has also been proposed as a possible psychological mechanism associated with the beneficial effects of these drugs [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Griffiths et al. 2006, 2008, 2011; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; MacLean et al. 2011; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. Indeed, recent studies in healthy individuals show that acute psilocybin administration induces highly meaningful and spiritually significant experiences with sustained positive changes in attitudes, mood, personality, and behavior [Griffiths et al. 2006, 2008, 2011; MacLean et al. 2011]. Moreover, a secondary analysis of the data from the study of psilocybin and tobacco dependence reported that the mystical-type effects of psilocybin and their personal meaning, spiritual significance, and impact on well-being were correlated with improvements in smoking cessation [Garcia-Romeu et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2014]. A qualitative follow-up assessment of the patients enrolled in the study of LSD-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with a life-threatening disease also suggested that the intense emotional experiences with mystic-like features produced by LSD could mediate the observed long-term beneficial changes in perspectives, attitudes, values, and quality of life [Gasser et al. 2014, 2015] Interestingly, these findings are consistent with studies that suggest that the dissociative, psychotomimetic, and mystical-type effects produced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine may mediate the anxiolytic [Kolp et al. 2007], antidepressive [Sos et al. 2013; Luckenbaugh et al. 2014], and antiaddictive [Krupitsky et al. 1992, 2002, 2007; Krupitsky and Grinenko, 1997; Jansen, 2001; Kolp et al. 2006; Krupitsky and Kolp, 2007; Dakwar et al. 2014a, 2014b] properties of this nonclassic hallucinogen. Moreover, some authors suggested that the temporary mental state produced by classic hallucinogens might induce profound long-term effects by producing an ‘inverse posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like effect’ in which a highly significant and positive experience would cause lasting beneficial changes, as opposed to chronic negative mood and other detrimental symptoms caused by a single traumatic event, which characterizes PTSD [MacLean et al. 2011; Young 2013; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2014] Human hallucinogenic research performed in the 1960s and 1970s also suggests that the context and the psychotherapeutic approach used in combination with classic hallucinogens are also important components of the beneficial effects produced by these drugs [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. The methodology of the clinical trials included in the present systematic review are very diverse regarding this topic: three studies assessed the effects of single-dose exposures without psychotherapeutic approaches [Moreno et al. 2006; Grob et al. 2011; Osório et al. 2015] and three trials included some form of psychological intervention over a few weeks [Gasser et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2014; Bogenschutz et al. 2015]. The studies without psychotherapy suggest that biochemical mechanisms may be involved in the beneficial effects observed. On the other hand, the inclusion of psychological interventions in the other studies suggests that at least some part of the therapeutic results is related to nondrug factors. Placebo effects and enhanced suggestibility may also play a role as adjuncts in hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy [Young, 2013; Carhart-Harris et al. 2015] Future research should investigate the possible influence of different psychotherapeutic approaches or other nondrug factors – such as patient preparation before drug administration and integration of the drug session afterwards – in mediating the therapeutic properties of classic hallucinogens No serious adverse reactions were reported in any of the clinical trials reviewed in the present systematic review, suggesting that classic hallucinogens can be safely administered to patients suffering anxiety, depression, or drug dependence. Previous experimental studies of acute ayahuasca administration to healthy volunteers [Riba et al. 2001, 2003, 2006; dos Santos et al. 2011, 2012; de Araujo et al. 2012; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; McKenna and Riba, 2016] also suggest that this drug can be safely administered in controlled experimental settings. Observational studies of long-term ayahuasca consumers [Grob et al. 1996; Barbosa et al. 2005, 2009, 2012; da Silveira et al. 2005; Doering-Silveira et al. 2005; Halpern et al. 2008; Fábregas et al. 2010; Bouso et al. 2012, 2015; dos Santos, 2013] also suggest that this brew has a low toxicity profile when consumed in ritual contexts. Previous clinical research [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Strassman, 1984; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; Liester, 2014; Smith et al. 2014; Tylš et al. 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016] and recent observational studies [Krebs and Johansen, 2013; Hendricks et al. 2014, 2015; Johansen and Krebs, 2015], drug harm or risk assessments [Nutt et al. 2010; van Amsterdam et al. 2011, 2013, 2015; Morgan et al. 2013], and experimental studies with healthy volunteers also suggest that psilocybin and LSD can be safely administered in controlled settings.","A main limitation of the present systematic review is the inclusion of a small number of studies (six) with small sample sizes (6–15 volunteers), which limits the generalization of the reported results. Included studies also show a high degree of heterogeneity, and three of the selected citations did not include placebo or a control group (open-label, proof-of-concept studies). Another important limitation is the difficulty in disentangling placebo effects, drug effects, and the influence of the psychological intervention included in the clinical trial However, despite these important limitations, results consistently showed that ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD produced anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects in patients, and these results were also observed in animal studies and with healthy volunteers. Given the low success rates of current pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for drug dependence and anxiety and mood disorders, and considering the high morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders, it is necessary to perform more studies with these drugs, even if only a small portion of patients may reduce their suffering with these drugs. Future studies should include more patients, placebo or active placebo, randomized and double-blind designs, and multiple doses during treatment. Moreover, the influence of psychological interventions and the possible increases in therapeutic efficacy proportionated by these psychotherapeutic approaches should be better explored Currently available pharmacological treatments for drug dependence and anxiety and mood disorders have limited efficacy and often produce important adverse reactions that may limit treatment continuation. Classic tryptamine hallucinogens such as ayahuasca/DMT, psilocybin, and LSD are safely administered in controlled settings and several basic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that these drugs have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects. Such beneficial properties seem to be mediated by an agonist action of these compounds on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors, which are involved in emotional processing, regulation of neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory actions, and modulation of frontal and medial brain structures. Other mechanisms of action not related to serotonergic receptors, such as regulation of cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxidative stress, also appear to mediate these therapeutic effects The reviewed studies suggest that the therapeutic use of classic hallucinogens may offer to some patients fast-acting and prolonged beneficial effects after a single dose, producing few adverse effects. Indeed, interest in the medicinal uses of this class of drugs is increasing: new clinical trials investigating the effects of psilocybin in the treatment of alcoholism, cocaine dependence, tobacco dependence, and anxiety and depression associated with cancer are currently underway [ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02061293, NCT02037126, NCT01943994, NCT00957359, NCT00465595]. Moreover, our group recently replicated the results of the original open-label, proof-of-concept study [Osório et al. 2015] but including an increased sample size (n =17) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), showing that ayahuasca antidepressive properties may be associated with increased blood perfusion in brain areas related to depressive symptoms (Sanches et al. 2016 “This reference was not included in the review because it was not published at the time of the electronic search”). Our group is currently performing randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the antidepressive and anxiolytic potentials of ayahuasca [Frood, 2015] Further studies are urgently needed to better understand the effects of classical tryptamine hallucinogens in psychiatric disorders."
20,10.1002/cpt.557,"One indication under early investigation was treatment with LSD of psychosocial distress in dying cancer patients.2-4 About two-thirds of cancer patients given LSD had improved mood and reduced anxiety and fear of death. More recently, Grob et al.5 administered 0.2 mg/kg oral psilocybin vs. niacin placebo to 12 patients with advanced-stage cancer having a diagnosis of anxiety related to their cancer. Psilocybin is a small molecular weight compound that occurs in nature. A variety of mushrooms from multiple genera, including the genus Psilocybe, produce psilocybin. Figure 1 shows an example of Psilocybe cubensis. The study observed no clinically significant adverse events, consistent with earlier trials. With the small sample size, they reported nonsignificant trends for benefits of psilocybin compared with niacin placebo on measures of depression and anxiety. Compared with pretreatment baseline, however, the patients' Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) trait anxiety subscale scores revealed a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Similarly, the patients' Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores showed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months compared with baseline.More recently, Carhart-Harris et al.6 published the results of an open-label feasibility trial of 12 patients with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression. Subjects received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. The study assessed depressive symptoms from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. Because of the lack of a control group in this study, readers should use caution in the interpretation of the results QIDS depression scores significantly decreased from baseline at 1 week and 3 months posttreatment, with the maximum effect at 2 weeks. BDI and clinician-administered ratings confirmed these results. All patients showed some reduction in depression severity at 1 week that was sustained in the majority for 3 months. According to standard criteria for determining remission (i.e., a BDI score ≤9), 8 (67%) of the 12 patients achieved complete remission at 1 week, and seven patients (58%) continued to meet criteria for response (50% reduction in BDI score relative to baseline) at 3 months, with five of them (42%) still in complete remission. STAI-T anxiety and SHAPS anhedonia scores also significantly decreased at 1 week and 3 months posttreatment from baseline We are aware of two larger randomized placebo-controlled studies recently completed by groups at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), directed by Roland Griffiths and one of the present authors (M.W.J.),7 and at New York University (NYU), directed by Stephen Ross.8 The results of these two studies are in press. Unlike the Carhart-Harris et al. and Grob et al. studies, they are reasonably large, well-powered phase II trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients suffering from cancer-related psychosocial distress (CRPD). These two studies represent the first sufficiently powered, formal double-blind, placebo-controlled assessment of a psychedelic agent for therapeutic effect using modern clinical approaches and assessment instruments. Neither study observed significant adverse events. Both of these studies found remarkable efficacy that is unprecedented for CRPD with any currently available conventional therapies The JHU study7 employed a two-session, double-blind, crossover design to investigate the effects of a high oral psilocybin dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg; equivalent to ∼0.31 and ∼0.43 mg/kg, respectively) with a low dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg; equivalent to ∼0.014 and ∼0.043 mg/kg, respectively), on outcome measures relevant to anxiety or depressive disorders caused or exacerbated by the cancer diagnosis. Therapeutically relevant outcome measures showing sustained effects at 6 months included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the STAI, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and the BDI. Consistent with persisting positive effects previously observed in healthy volunteers,9 the immediate postsession mystical experience score showed a significant correlation with therapeutic efficacy. The definition of mystical experience is a subjective experience involving substantial participant endorsement of the following categories: internal unity, external unity, noetic quality, sacredness, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and ineffability.10 The study showed that a single psilocybin dose, given under supportive conditions to screened and prepared participants, produced substantial and enduring decreases in anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis The NYU study8 used a therapeutic approach and clinical setting that were similar to the one employed in the JHU study, the chief difference being the use of niacin as the active placebo control instead of low-dose psilocybin. Again, the study documented dramatic symptom reductions, with large effect sizes comparable to the JHU study, and efficacy sustained for 6 months after treatment. As with the JHU study, the authors safely administered a single moderate psilocybin dose (21 mg/70 kg) in conjunction with psychotherapy to a cohort of patients with life-threatening cancer, and observed acute and sustained anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Here too, the intensity of the subjective mystical experience correlated with clinical benefit, including improved attitudes toward disease progression and death, improved quality of life, and increased spiritual well-being Similarly, Gasser et al.11 employed LSD-assisted therapy in 12 patients with anxiety related to a diagnosis of life-threatening diseases. Patients received either 200 μg LSD (free base) or a 20 μg active placebo dose of LSD with an open-label crossover to 200 μg LSD after unblinding. There were no serious adverse effects associated with the treatment. Positive trends found using the STAI persisted for 12 months after treatment. Subsequently, Gasser et al.12 followed up the same participants 12 months later to examine long-term effects on anxiety and explore subjective experiences and lasting psychologic effects. Nine of the original subjects participated. Gasser et al.12 found that the STAI state and trait scores did not increase after the end of the study. In semistructured interviews, seven of nine participants reported a sustained reduction in anxiety. None of the participants reported lasting negative effects. The authors concluded that LSD-assisted psychotherapy in patients with a life-threatening illness demonstrated safety and positive stable treatment outcomes at long-term follow-up Recently, in an open-label clinical trial in patients suffering from depression, ayahuasca, a South American plant decoction that contains the hallucinogenic compound N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), produced marked improvement in depressive symptoms with no mania or hypomania for up to 21 days after a single dose.",
21,10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.04.010,"In this study, we found that psilocybin attenuated task-induced activation in the amygdala in response to negative and neutral pictures but had no effect on activation of the primary motor cortex. This psilocybin-induced effect was significantly stronger in the right amygdala than in the left amygdala. Furthermore, psilocybin increased subjective reports of positive mood but did not increase anxiety. Importantly, the effect of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity was most strongly associated with positive mood change. Reduction of amygdala reactivity by psilocybin is consistent with our a priori hypothesis and provides a mechanistic framework to understand psilocybin-induced effects on emotion processing. The current findings support the notion that psilocybin has the potential to normalize limbic hyperactivity in persons with depressed mood state We did not find a significant drug by emotion interaction, and planned comparisons showed a reduction of amygdala reactivity in response to both negative and neutral pictures. Therefore, our results do not support a valence-specific effect of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity, i.e., we cannot conclude that psilocybin specifically reduced amygdala reactivity in response to negative pictures. This is in line with previous electrophysiological studies where valence-specific effects of psilocybin on emotion processing have been found but only for positive stimuli, not for neutral stimuli, and only within the first 200 milliseconds after stimulus onset (19, 20, 21). For example, Bernasconi et al. (21) found a decrease of early (168–189 milliseconds after stimulus onset) electrophysiological responses to negative and neutral faces localized within bilateral parahippocampal/insula and right temporo-occipital regions and a decrease of late (211–242 milliseconds after stimulus onset) electrophysiological responses to positive faces within the same regions Therefore, our study might have missed valence-specific effects because we used a blocked-design fMRI method, which has good spatial resolution but relatively low temporal resolution compared with electroencephalography (41). Future studies using time-varying stimulus conditions might further clarify this discrepancy The observed effects of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity in response to negative and neutral stimuli were lateralized to the right side. This finding is in accordance with recent evidence that SSRIs preferentially attenuate right amygdala responses to negative stimuli (42, 43). The preferential effect of SSRIs on the right amygdala might be attributable to genetic variations in the expression of serotonin transporters, as recent studies have revealed that genetic variations in the availability of serotonin transporters are associated with individual differences in right amygdala activity (8, 9). The notion that the right amygdala is particularly relevant to processing negative emotions is further supported by a study in patients undergoing surgery for treatment-resistant partial epilepsies (44), which reported that direct electrical stimulation of the right amygdala induced negative emotions, whereas stimulation of the left amygdala induced either positive or negative emotions. However, findings regarding lateralization of serotonergic effects on amygdala reactivity during emotion processing are still divergent (42, 43, 44), and a recent meta-analysis (10) reported similar effect size for the right and left amygdala. Therefore, the relevance of the observed lateralization effect remains inconclusive The complementary whole-brain analysis revealed that psilocybin decreased activation in the visual cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies (45, 46, 47) have shown that in the hallucinating brain, the visual cortex is in a state of hyperexcitability, leading to increased BOLD signals in the visual cortex due to internally generated neuronal excitation. It has been shown that a tonic increase of neuronal activity may actually decrease BOLD responses to external, task-related stimuli in the visual cortex (48). Therefore, the psilocybin-induced decrease of activation in the visual cortex might be related to hyperexcitability of neurons in the visual cortex and to visual perceptual alterations. This notion is supported by the recent studies of Kometer et al. (49, 50), which demonstrated that psilocybin decreased stimulus-induced responses in the visual cortex and the decrease correlated with the intensity of visual hallucinations. However, given that we evaluated a contrast (negative minus shapes—both of which included a visual stimulus) that decreased during psilocybin treatment in areas shown in Table 1 and given that psilocybin-induced decrease of activity in these regions was driven by decreased BOLD responses to negative stimuli but not by increased BOLD responses to the baseline condition, we cannot conclude that an increase of baseline activity in the visual cortex caused the observed BOLD decreases. Given the abundance of backprojections from the amygdala to the visual cortex that may modulate processing of threat-related signals in the visual cortex (51), we speculate that psilocybin-induced attenuation of amygdala activation might have reduced the activation that normally occurs in the visual cortex in response to threat-related visual stimuli. This notion is supported by an event-related fMRI study in patients with medial temporal lobe sclerosis (52) that showed amygdala lesions may attenuate activation of visual cortex in response to fearful stimuli. However, future connectivity studies are warranted to investigate the effects of psilocybin on emotion processing and amygdala reactivity in relation to distant brain regions. This notion is supported by a recent study of Hornboll et al. (53) reporting that ketanserin administration modulated amygdala-prefrontal coupling in response to fearful faces In addition to the effects on amygdala reactivity, psilocybin increased positive mood state, as evidenced by a pronounced increase in the PANAS positive affect subscore, but had no effect on negative mood state, as indicated by the PANAS negative affect subscore, or anxiety, as indicated by the STAI state score. Psilocybin is a mixed 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonist, and it has consistently been shown that the psychotropic effects of psilocybin are predominantly mediated by activation of 5-HT2A receptors (16, 17). Therefore, the finding that psilocybin acutely increased positive mood state is consistent with psilocybin-ketanserin blocking studies (19, 54) that showed the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist ketanserin completely blocked the mood-increasing effects of psilocybin. Notably, we found that the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state was related to the psilocybin-induced decrease in right amygdala reactivity. Given the dependence of psilocybin-induced mood changes on 5-HT2A receptors, these results indicate that 5-HT2A receptor stimulation critically underlies the observed effects of psilocybin on right amygdala reactivity Nevertheless, at the synaptic level, the mechanism by which 5-HT receptor stimulation leads to inhibition of the amygdala is not completely understood. Despite strong evidence that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is necessary to mediate the hallucinogen action of psilocybin (16, 17), psilocin, the bioactive metabolite of psilocybin, also activates 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors (55, 56). Serotonergic neurons originate in the brainstem raphe nuclei and release 5-HT at terminal nerve ends within projection areas, such as the amygdala (57, 58, 59). In the amygdala, both 5-HT1A (60, 61) and 5-HT2A receptors (62, 63, 64) are present in large quantities and are located on gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons that inhibit postsynaptic cell firing (65). Therefore, 5-HT receptor stimulation in the amygdala may indirectly inhibit amygdala reactivity via activation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors (61, 66). Given the critical role of 5-HT1A/2A receptors in mood (67, 68, 69) and anxiety disorders (70, 71, 72, 73) and given the abundance of postsynaptic 5-HT1A/2A receptors in the amygdala (59), the observed attenuation of amygdala reactivity might also have resulted from activation of either 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A postsynaptic receptors. The view that amygdala inhibition is mediated by 5-HT activation is supported by the observation that central 5-HT–deficient mice showed a higher level of amygdala/hippocampus-dependent fear conditioning than wild-type mice, and this was reversed by cerebral injection of 5-HT (74). Moreover, Catlow et al. (75) reported that psilocybin facilitated extinction of conditioned fear responses in the amygdala/hippocampus in mice, thus providing strong evidence of 5-HT1A/2A-related inhibition of amygdala/hippocampus reactivity. Finally, a combined positron emission tomography–fMRI study by Fisher et al. (76) demonstrated that 5-HT1A autoreceptor density in the brainstem region of the dorsal raphe nucleus accounted for 44% of the variability in right amygdala reactivity during emotion processing. In addition, given that psilocybin is also a 5-HT2C agonist (56), 5-HT2C activation might theoretically have contributed to the acute effects observed here. However, both animal (77) and human (78) studies have reported that acute 5-HT2C blockade, rather than 5-HT2C activation, may be anxiolytic, although psilocybin did not modulate state anxiety in this study. Therefore, we consider it rather implausible that 5-HT2C activation substantially contributed to the effects of psilocybin during emotion processing. In summary, substantial evidence indicates that an increase of serotonergic tone in the amygdala is a crucial mechanism underlying the acute effects of psilocybin. Therefore, it may be worth developing combined 5-HT1A/2A agonists that rapidly increase serotonergic neurotransmission in the amygdala, as available treatment options (e.g., SSRIs and buspirone) are inefficient, delayed, or associated with side effects (79, 80) In conclusion, our study investigated the neural substrates underlying the acute effects of psilocybin on emotion processing. We showed that acute treatment with psilocybin caused a marked decrease of amygdala reactivity in healthy volunteers and that this was related to an increase in positive mood state. These findings are in line with previous models of antidepressant action (34, 81, 82), which pose a decrease of amygdala reactivity as a necessary change associated with treatment response and remission from neuroaffective disturbance. Substantial support for the notion that psilocybin may have rapid antidepressant characteristics also comes from a recent clinical trial showing that in patients with depression and anxiety, a single dose of psilocybin improved mood and decreased anxiety for several months (27). However, despite this and previous evidence (18, 22, 24, 25, 26) of putative antidepressant effects, psilocybin might not show similar actions in patients with depression. Therefore, the effects of psilocybin on mood state and amygdala reactivity in patients with depression remain to be addressed in future clinical studies",
22,10.1177/0022167817709585,"A qualitative, thematic analysis performed on 6-month follow-up interview data in a recently completed clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD generated two major themes relating to how the treatment had been effective. Specifically, patients described the treatment as having driven a change from disconnection to connection, and from emotional avoidance to acceptance. Additionally, patients described previous treatments as being reinforcing of disconnection and avoidance, and so the psilocybin treatment was seen as a welcome and valuable alternative As will be detailed in a forthcoming formal study report (Carhart-Harris, 2017) average treatment effects were exceptionally large for the first 5 weeks and then dropped to levels associated with more conventional treatments at 3 and 6 months. Most patients still reported feeling some discernable benefits after 6 months, however, and all reported preferring psilocybin to conventional treatments they had previously tried and expressed an interest in further psilocybin therapy. None reported classic craving behavior in relation to psilocybin, consistent with evidence that psilocybin carries no recognizable addiction potential (Bogenschutz et al., 2015). There were also no reports of enduring psychoses, persisting “hallucinations,” or phenomena consistent with hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder Regarding the first change process, whereas the experience of depression was described as a sense of the world getting smaller until patients felt like they lived inside their minds, the psilocybin treatment was described as providing an experience of expansion: the mind “rebooted,” they were able to connect to their senses, others, and the outside world again. Such a rebooting process was often described as a “normalization” back to how they had been before the depression, rather than a hypomanic-like response Alongside this expansion outward, an “inner” expansion also seemed to have taken place: During dosing sessions, patients were able to accept rather than avoid painful feelings and memories, and reported a range of intense emotions. For many, a sense of openness to emotion persisted for months afterward, including long-term improvements in willingness to accept difficult memories and painful feelings, and also the capacity to feel compassion, love, and appreciation. This is consistent with previous findings of sustained increases in trait Openness in healthy volunteers after high dose psilocybin sessions (MacLean, Johnson, & Griffiths, 2011). The notion of an expanded “emotional repertoire” seems consistent with the length and descriptiveness of patients’ accounts of their experiences. The 17 who reported feeling significant drug effects during the dosing sessions gave far richer accounts of both their depression and psychedelic treatment than the three patients who did not have appreciable drug experiences Mechanistically, the above described “expansion” resonates with insights gleaned from recent neuroimaging and pharmacological studies of psychedelics. Psychedelics are known to stimulate serotonin receptors in the brain (the 2A subtype) that mediate flexible thinking (Boulougouris, Glennon, & Robbins, 2008; Carhart-Harris, Kaelen, et al., 2016; Kuypers et al., 2016). Moreover, acute brain imaging has suggested that the brain enters a hyperplastic state under psychedelics that may facilitate learning and change (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Carhart-Harris, Kaelen, et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris, Muthukumaraswamy, et al., 2016). Such a process can be likened to annealing in metallurgy, where a metal is heated in order to make it malleable. In this case, the metal is analogous to the mind and brain and the heat is the excitatory action of the psychedelic. In line with this analogy, future research is required to investigate how crucial psychological priming and environmental factors are in determining the short- and long-term effects of psychedelics. From the reports provided here, one suspects that drug × environment interactions are essential determiners of the quality of responses The processes of connection and acceptance have parallels to ideas from depth psychology: for example, Jungian notions of the collective unconscious, symbolism, archetypes and the shadow, and Freudian themes of the unconscious, dreamwork, abreaction, and catharsis. Maslow’s notions of self-actualization, and the assimilation of problematic experiences model (Stiles et al., 1990) are also relevant Initiatives to systematically examine the relative merits of different therapeutic approaches and environmental components (e.g., music) are currently being considered, and this work should ideally lead to a standardization of the therapeutic approach for psychedelic therapy. This process should help address present ambiguities about what psychedelic “psychotherapy” actually entails (see Fadiman, 2011; Goldsmith, 2011; Grof, 1980; Masters & Houston, 1966; Meckel Fisher, 2015, Richards, 2015; Stolaroff, 2004, for a variety of approaches) and what components are essential (or not) for maximizing positive therapeutic outcomes Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an approach that may be particularly complementary to the specific character of the psychedelic experience. ACT aims to improve “psychological flexibility” via six key processes, all of which resonate with the themes generated by patients in this study, that is, willingness to experience painful emotions, “defragging” rigid thought patterns, exploration/observation of experience, contact with the present moment, focusing on values, and committing to actions in the service of those values. There is a growing evidence base to suggest that ACT has long-term benefits for patients with depression (Forman, Herbert, Moitra, Yeomans, & Geller, 2007; Forman, Shaw, Goetter, Herbert, & Park, 2012). What ACT and depth psychology have in common is the focus on exploration, acceptance, and integration of painful experience and difficult emotions, rather than attempting to change those emotional states. Future research may be carried out to assess the possibility of using ACT in conjunction with psychedelics. Group therapy may also be complementary to psychedelics, as it aims to facilitate reconnection (Yalom & Leszcz, 2005) Patients in this study reported feeling disenchanted with traditional treatments for depression. Antidepressants and poorly delivered short-term talking therapies were seen as repeating and reinforcing the disconnection and emotional avoidance that they knew was a fundamental feature of their depression. For some, these treatments are seen as promoting a view of psychological pain as something that should be systematically suppressed, rather than explored as a symptom of an underlying problem that needs to be accessed and processed. Granted CBT and antidepressants have solid evidence bases of safety and efficacy (Pilling, Anderson, Goldberg, Meader, & Taylor, 2009); however, the patients in the current study appeared to value the opportunity the present treatment afforded them to access their emotional pain. This was described as cathartic for many, bringing tears of relief, and reports of feeling lighter and more open afterwards The novelty and potential antithetical nature of psychedelic therapy in relation to conventional talking and pharmacological therapies could be seen as a major positive, since it suggests that patients and clinicians may be granted a broader palette of treatment options in the future, affording them an opportunity to select a treatment that best suits the specific needs and/or desires of a given patient. Also, rather than viewing psychedelic treatment as competitive with conventional treatments, future studies may wish to examine the possibility of using psychedelic therapy as a possible catalyst of and/or supplement to these conventional treatments. For example, a psychedelic experience could be introduced at a strategic point within a standard 12-week course of CBT, with the intention of improving insight and motivation. A similar design was piloted in a recent psilocybin for tobacco addiction trial, with considerable success (Johnson et al., 2016) Focusing on limitations of psychedelic treatment, an alternative explanation for the replicable benefits reported by patients here is that the level of care and attention from the research team was exceptional, especially in relation to previous treatments they had received. This level of care will likely have enhanced transference relationships and the (perhaps implicit) desire of the patients to get well for their therapists. Expectation is known to play a role in determining treatment outcomes (Greenberg, Constantino, & Bruce, 2006; Visla, Constantino, Newkirk, Ogrodniczuk, & Söchting, 2016; Wampold, 2015; Wampold et al., 2005) and it is likely that many of the patients in this trial had positive expectations and/or experienced a positive modulation of their expectations in response to their intense drug experience(s) and the positive attention they received from their therapists. The researchers’ implicit positive regard toward the treatment may also have biased outcomes and patients may have easily gleaned the study demand characteristics and felt an implicit desire to confirm them. All these factors can and will be better controlled and tested in future studies assessing the efficacy of psychedelic therapy Regarding other biases, it is likely that there was a (self)-selection bias, that is, that patients sought out this trial because they were “believers” wanting to demonstrate that it could and would be effective for them. Moreover, since all of the patients had treatment-resistant depression, it is not surprising they held negative views about their previous unsuccessful treatments and were thus inclined to see a novel, unconventional intervention such as psilocybin, in a positive light. This probably does not account for how marked and enduring the positive outcomes were for many of the patients and how specific and consistent their criticisms were about past failed treatments. Nevertheless, the issue of selection bias must be better addressed in future trials, for example, by recruiting more patients through external referral mechanisms rather than self-referral, and measuring expectations at baseline and calculating their explanatory power The present article focuses on positive outcomes. However, this positive “bias” is a product of the data. The two positive change themes were the dominant themes expressed by the patients (see Table 1). Enquiries were made about negative outcomes of the treatment but comparatively little was offered in this respect. Previous qualitative analyses of patient-reported experiences of psychedelic treatment have found similarly positive regard for these interventions (Gasser et al., 2015; Belser et al., 2017). In the current study, a very small number of patients criticized some aspect of the way the therapists delivered the treatment (i.e., one did not warm to a specific guide and three wanted more therapeutic support posttreatment) but there was nothing substantial relating to the intervention itself. There were no serious adverse events reported during the dosing sessions or their aftermath Regarding specific cases, Patient 14 reported an apparent “reliving” of a childhood trauma. The therapy team felt it unwise to offer a judgment on whether this was a real memory or fantasy, however, and instead chose to treat it as psychologically interesting and worthy of discussion regardless of its veridicality. This ambiguity was initially uncomfortable for the patient, however, who hoped for an “expert answer” about whether what he had “seen” was true. This desire for closure subsided in time, however, as the patient talked through the incident with the study team. Another patient (P15) had a particularly intense high-dose session, becoming uncommunicative for a prolonged period (i.e., 2-3 hours) during the peak drug effects. The patient’s vital signs remained normal throughout, however, barely deviating from predrug baseline, and subsequent interviews revealed that this period had mostly been extremely “blissful” for the patient. For the therapy team, this putative mutism was concerning for a period; however, hindsight has taught us to simply sit out such situations (unless vital signs suggest otherwise), waiting for the idiosyncratic symptoms to subside. The positive physiological safety profile of psilocybin can offer reassurance in this regard There is a need for further qualitative research within studies assessing psychedelics for other indications, such as addiction (Bogenschutz & Johnson, 2016) and obsessive compulsive disorder (Moreno et al., 2006). Subthemes identified in the current study closely matched themes identified in previous qualitative analyses of psychedelic treatment studies, for example, “deschematizing and viewing experiences in another perspective,” “facilitated access to emotions and catharsis,” and “no negative aspects of the treatment” (Gasser et al., 2015); “relational embeddedness,” “emotional range,” and “desire to repeat the psilocybin experience” (Belser et al., 2017) It is notable that psychedelic treatment has been found to help a wide range of conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, smoking cessation, and end-of-life anxiety (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). It may be that psychedelics have an impact on certain fundamental processes that underlie many psychiatric conditions. Perhaps the diagnosed disorders represent different manifest expressions of consistent latent problems, such as repression of emotional pain and/or ego-dystonic psychological material (Freud, 1995), and/or a lack of meaning (Frankl, 1961) and/or disconnection from others (Bowlby, 1978). Thus, psychedelic research may help further our knowledge of core, root features of mental ill-being. Over the past 20 years, there has been an ever-increasing push in psychiatry to start promoting consideration of disease spectrums rather than distinct entities, and perhaps psychedelics could play a role in informing and improving the way we think about, and treat, mental illness, and wellness. It is inevitable that such a paradigmatic shift will meet resistance as it treads on the toes of convention, but its “success” may ultimately prove irresistible, if its foundations are strong Within the current medical model of mental illness, treatments are designed to mollify symptoms. However, in the present study, the benefit of treatment was not restricted to a reduction in symptomatology. When rumination started again after a few months, several patients still reported feeling better than before the treatment, claiming that there was greater meaning in their lives. For some, although scores on standard depression rating scales indicated treatment relapse, their comments during the 6-month interviews suggested major persistent changes in their perspectives and behaviors. This suggests that improved measures, more sensitive to changes in psychological well-being for example, should be considered to help capture and communicate real-world changes that are not adequately picked up by standard rating scales. It could be said that patients were not just losing symptoms of depression but were, in many cases, gaining happiness, which has been defined as “pleasure, engagement, and meaning” (Seligman, Parks, & Steen, 2004), Happiness, or psychological well-being, may be a valuable construct in this context. For example, it seemed that months after the psilocybin, patients were still able to benefit from the renewed meaning in their lives. To take one particular example from a patient whose depression had returned at the time of interview, she reported still feeling connected to what she described as her “inner teacher,” remained vegetarian (since the dosing session), and said that the trees continued to looked greener In conclusion, via thematic analysis applied to structured interviews performed 6 months after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression in 20 patients, we identified two major themes relating to how the treatment had been beneficial: (a) a change from disconnection (from the self, others, and the outside world) to connection and (b) a change from avoidance of difficult emotions and memories to acceptance. Provocatively, patients reported that previous treatments functioned to reinforce defensive strategies of disconnection/retreat and avoidance, whereas treatment with psilocybin promoted a confrontation and subsequent reconnection that was lasting in many cases. The approach taken here complements more formal, quantitative analyses of the utility of psilocybin (Carhart-Harris, Bolstridge, et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris, 2017; Gasser et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016) and should help inform and enrich understanding of this novel treatment and its mechanisms of action, helping generate new hypotheses that can be tested in subsequent research",
23,10.1177/0269881114568039,"We failed to find any associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and past year serious psychological distress, receiving or needing mental health treatment, depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts or behavior in the past year. Rather, lifetime use of psychedelics was associated with decreased inpatient psychiatric treatment. In addition to not being significantly different from no association, in all cases the calculated aORs were small (for all, psychedelic use aOR < 1.2) Stratifying by age, gender, past year illicit drug use or childhood depressive episode did not substantially change the results of any of the logistic regression analyses. Likewise, lifetime use of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline or peyote, or past year use of LSD was not associated with a higher rate of mental health problems Most claims about the harms from psychedelics have been based on theoretical assumptions and case reports, which should be evaluated with caution. See our earlier population study of mental health among psychedelic users for further discussion about case reports and previous studies (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b In particular, our previous population study (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b) did not support either the idea of ‘flashbacks’, described in extreme cases as recurrent psychotic episodes, hallucinations, or panic attacks, or the more recent ‘hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder’ (HPPD), described as persistent visual phenomena with accompanying anxiety and distress, since lifetime use of psychedelics and past year use of LSD was not associated with past year symptoms of visual phenomena (‘seeing something others could not’), panic attacks, psychosis or overall serious psychological distress. Recent randomized controlled trials with psilocybin have not reported any cases of flashbacks or persistent visual phenomena (Griffiths et al., 2008, 2011; Studerus et al., 2011). Interviews with over 500 regular participants in Native American peyote ceremonies did not identify anyone with flashbacks or persistent visual symptoms (Halpern et al., 2005). Occasional visual phenomena are common in the general population, and all of the symptoms included in the purported HPPD are also present in people who have never used psychedelics. A recent study of 120 US adults troubled by HPPD-like persistent visual symptoms found a lower than average rate of psychedelic use (Schankin et al., 2014). Overall, the validity of the HPPD diagnosis remains scant. HPPD may fit within the somatic symptom disorders. For further discussion, see Our results might reflect beneficial effects of psychedelic use, relatively better initial mental health among people who use psychedelics or chance ‘false positive’ findings. However, it is well documented that psychedelics elicit spiritual experiences. Indeed, long-term psychological benefits have been reported in several clinical trials of LSD, for example, ‘About half of the total sample felt they had achieved more understanding and acceptance of themselves and a broader tolerance of the view points of others via the LSD experience’ (McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971). In a recent randomized controlled trial of psilocybin, most of the participants (67%) regarded the experience as one of the most personally significant moments in their lives (comparable to the birth of a first child) (Griffiths et al., 2006) and, furthermore, most of the participants (64%) reported improved well-being or life satisfaction 14 months later (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008; MacLean et al., 2011). People often report long-term benefits from LSD use (Morgan et al., 2010). No serious adverse events have been reported in recent randomized controlled trials of psilocybin, demonstrating that psychedelics can be administered safely in medical contexts (Griffiths et al., 2008, 2011; Johnson et al., 2008; Studerus et al., 2011). Case–control and longitudinal studies have not found evidence of increased mental health problems among people who have used traditional psychedelics (peyote or ayahuasca) hundreds of times in legally recognized religious ceremonies (Bouso et al., 2012; Halpern et al., 2005) This study had a retrospective, cross-sectional design, making it impossible to draw causal inferences. Many potentially important risk factors, such as family mental health history, were not available. Longitudinal data were not available on mental health or other factors before psychedelic use. We cannot exclude the possibility that use of psychedelics might have a negative effect on mental health for some individuals or groups, which might be counterbalanced at a population level by a positive effect on mental health for others. People who choose to use psychedelics might have better initial mental health before using psychedelics, and people who experience problems apparently related to psychedelics may choose to not use them again. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons, so some of the associations with weak statistical significance are likely due to chance. Screening questions, rather than diagnostic interviews, were used as symptom indicators. We did not have data on setting of use or factors that might influence the experience of psychedelics. The study also relied on self-reports of drug use. Participants’ answers to the questions on behaviors and mental health could be influenced by memory errors and under-reporting; however, a 14-year longitudinal study reported good consistency over time in reporting of LSD use (Johnston and O’Malley, 1997). Use of dimethyltryptamine (DMT), found in the shamanic brew ayahuasca, could not be determined from the data set; however, recent studies of people who have used ayahuasca hundreds of times have not detected evidence of problems (Bouso et al., 2012). Dosage and purity of street drugs is often unknown and, in particular, substances sold as mescaline often contain LSD or other substances (Laing and Siegel 2003). A small group (< 2%) of US adults in prison, hospital or military service was not included in the NSDUH sampling This study did not find any associations between psychedelic use and increased likelihood of past year suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts. Rather, among people with childhood depression, those who had used psychedelics had lower likelihood of past year suicidal thoughts and plans There is little evidence linking psychedelic use to later suicide. A study of 178 adolescents with psychosis reported that suicide attempt was more likely among those who had used LSD, but there was no adjustment for other factors and it was not recorded whether the suicide attempt occurred before or after LSD use (Shoval et al., 2006). A case–control study of 96 adolescents with depression reported that suicide attempt was more likely among those with hallucinogen abuse or dependence, but ‘hallucinogen’ was not defined and likely included drugs such as MDMA and PCP, there was little adjustment for other factors, and it was not recorded whether the suicide attempt occurred before or after hallucinogen use (Kelly et al., 2002 In the past, some people seem to have assumed that taking psychedelics, or indeed engaging in any introspective practice, could lead to depression and suicide because of the supposedly disturbing and disappointing nature of self-knowledge (Evang, 1968); however, there now seems to be greater acceptance of introspective practices (such as ‘mindfulness’ or meditation) among the public and mental health professionals. In a small number of publicized cases, relatives or anti-psychedelic campaigners have blamed an individual’s suicide on prior psychedelic use, without evidence of any clear connection. For instance, in 1909 a Native American peyote church member killed himself (Stewart, 1987), and his death was then cited as evidence against peyote; in the 1960s there were a few cases where relatives blamed a suicide on prior LSD use (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2005). In surveys of US, Canadian and British physicians who administered LSD to thousands of psychiatric patients in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a small number of suicides and suicide attempts were reported (in people with prior suicide attempt or serious mental illness) in the year or so after taking a dose of LSD (Canada Department of National Health and Welfare, 1973; Cohen 1960; Malleson 1971; US Senate, Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization, 1968). Based on these and other studies, the rate of adverse events following clinical treatment with LSD was considered to be similar to that expected among psychiatric patients in general, and overall LSD was considered to have acceptable safety for clinical use When evaluating case reports of suicide in psychedelic users, it is important to note that suicide is one of the most common causes of death in the general population: approximately two out of every 100 people in the US will die by suicide (CDC, 2013). Cases of suicide or death due to other causes during the direct effects of psychedelics are extremely rare, despite the fact that millions of doses are consumed annually (EMCDDA, 2011). It is of note that many of the stories from 50 years ago about death or injury of people while on LSD appear to be unsubstantiated urban legends Concern about psychedelic use seems to have been based on media sensationalism, lack of information and cultural biases, rather than evidence-based harm assessments. As examples of cultural biases, a 1967 case series of five university students with ‘prolonged adverse reactions’ to peyote consisted of a homosexual student who started a relationship with another male student, a student with pre-existing depression who wanted to travel to India and study Eastern religions, a student who left school and became a ‘beatnik’, a student who was prompted to seek psychotherapy for pre-existing social anxiety and paranoia about homosexuals, and an engineering student who had visions while falling asleep and eventually took a break from school to do volunteer work (Kleber, 1967). There was a common view in the early 20th century that mystical or transcendent experiences were, almost by definition, delusional and anti-scientific, and that self-exploration without the supervision of a trained therapist was dangerous (Evang, 1968; Hayman, 1964). While discussing psychedelics, psychiatrist Max Hayman wrote, ;The practices of the Christian mystics constitute one of the most tragic chapters of human history… Science is the path we have chosen to aid in man’s growth and development, and mysticism in whatever guise is a contaminant of the scientific attitude’ (Hayman, 1964). In an influential 1966 Time magazine interview, psychiatrist Sidney Cohen, one of the most prominent critics of the emerging psychedelic culture, commented on his own LSD experience: ‘I got a massive jolt that I’ll never forget. I got a chance to really look at myself, and I didn’t like some of the things I saw’ (Time, 1966) The original World Health Organization (WHO) assessment of psychedelics, prepared for the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, claimed that psychedelics caused a list of problems; however, the references cited included no evidence of harm from psilocybin, mescaline or DMT, and only a small number of case reports and anecdotes of possibly LSD-related adverse effects (Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970; WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, 1969). Central to the argument for international restrictions on psychedelics was the claim that psychedelics caused a special ‘LSD-type’ dependence, defined as ‘periodic’ use amongst ‘arty-type’ people (Eddy et al., 1965; Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970; WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, 1969). Psychedelics were claimed to have ‘high abuse potential’ simply because there were reports of their use (Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970). The WHO report acknowledged that LSD and other psychedelics ‘are usually taken in the hope of inducing a mystical experience leading to a greater understanding of the users’ personal problems and of the universe’ and that people diagnosed with mental disorders following psychedelic use ‘are generally believed to have been persons who were “predisposed” to psychiatric disease’ (Isbell and Chrusciel, 1970) As noted recently by the British Medical Association (BMA), ‘The cultural and social attitudes surrounding illegal drugs mean that their classification and legal status do not directly relate to the health risks they pose to users and communities’ (BMA, 2012). A 1970 assessment of LSD by the UK Home Office acknowledged that use of LSD and other psychedelics was a sincere spiritual practice, noting, ‘We have been content to accept the sincerity of those of our witnesses who claimed that some people have reached a greater awareness and insight into their own problems and, indeed, into the meaning of life itself, through their use of LSD’. The UK assessment explained that ‘there is a presumption in favour of allowing adult men and women to consume whatever substances they please, but this presumption must be overridden in circumstances in which such freedom results in a serious danger to public health… [Evidence for which] would have to be kept under continual review in the light of rapidly developing scientific knowledge and accelerating social change’ (Home Office, Department of Health and Social Security, 1970). The only epidemiological data on non-clinical use of LSD included in the UK assessment was a table showing that 127 people who were admitted to UK psychiatric hospitals in 1966–1968 had reported having tried LSD at some point, not necessarily related to the hospital visit (Home Office, Department of Health and Social Security, 1970); these cases were a surely a tiny fraction of total psychiatric admissions or total LSD users at that time. We failed to find, in this study or in our previous population study, evidence linking past year LSD use to increased likelihood of inpatient mental health treatment (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b) A 1975 report from the US National Institute of Mental Health noted that people who use LSD ‘repetitively in a social pattern’ ‘cannot be characterized by any specific psychiatric label’ and called for more ‘scientific study of hallucinogen-derived mystical experiences… described as powerful and sometimes transforming’ (Segal, 1975). A 1968 US Senate report on LSD policy noted that all expert witnesses were opposed to criminalizing LSD use and concluded: ‘The tardy reaction of the Government was rash and excessive, resulting in the termination of almost all research… As protector of the public safety and supporter to medical research, the Government had an obligation to maintain a balanced perspective concerning LSD at a time of public tumult. It failed to do so’ (US Senate Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization, 1968). LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and several other psychedelics are included in Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970; these substances were simply placed in Schedule I by Congress without an evidence-based assessment to determine whether LSD and other psychedelics met criteria to be added to Schedule I. There may have been a political rather than public health rationale behind the criminalization of psychedelic users. It is deeply troubling to read an interview with John Ehrlichman, advisor to US President Richard Nixon, in which he explains that the War on Drugs was ‘really about’ hurting ‘the antiwar Left, and black people’, and openly admits, ‘Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did’ (Baum, 2012)","The results of this study are consistent with our previous population study, early and recent randomized controlled trials, studies of regular participants in legally recognized psychedelic religious ceremonies, drug education materials from public agencies and recent expert assessments of drug harms (Krebs and Johansen, 2013b). There is little evidence linking psychedelic use to lasting mental health problems. In general, use of psychedelics does not appear to be particularly dangerous when compared to other activities considered to have acceptable safety. It is important to take a statistical perspective to risk, rather than focusing on case reports and anecdotes: ‘Nothing in life is free from risk – risk is simply impossible to avoid… Even ordinary activities – eating breakfast, watching television, walking the dog – carry risks, however minor’ (BMA, 2012). As Steven Pinker recently noted, ‘In a free society, one cannot empower the government to outlaw any behavior that offends someone just because the offendee can pull a hypothetical future injury out of the air’ (Pinker, 2008). Overall, it is difficult to see how prohibition of psychedelics can be justified from a public health or human rights perspective."
24,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3285,"This randomized clinical trial documented the substantial rapid and enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy among patients with MDD. Although the rapid antidepressant effects of psilocybin are similar to those reported with ketamine,10,11 the therapeutic effects are different: ketamine effects typically last for a few days to 2 weeks, whereas the current study showed that clinically significant antidepressant response to psilocybin therapy persisted for at least 4 weeks, with 71% of the participants continuing to show a clinically significant response (≥50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score) at week 4 of follow-up. Furthermore, psilocybin was found to have low potential for addiction22 and a minimal adverse event profile,22,23 suggesting therapeutic advantages with less risk for associated problems than ketamine.12 The present findings in patients with MDD are consistent with results of studies that reported on the effectiveness of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing antidepressant effects among patients with cancer who had psychological distress16,17,47 and a small open-label study of patients with treatment-resistant depression The mounting evidence of the use of psilocybin as an adjunct to treatment of a variety of psychiatric conditions (eg, depression,16-18 tobacco use disorder,48 and alcohol use disorder49) suggests a transdiagnostic mechanism of action. In several studies in patients16-18,49-51 and in healthy volunteers,32,52 the intensity of mystical-type experiences reported after psilocybin sessions was associated with favorable outcomes. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies have suggested that mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences during a psychedelic session predict positive therapeutic effects.53-55 Consistent with these previous studies, the current trial showed that psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type, personally meaningful, and insightful experiences were associated with decreases in depression at 4 weeks (eResults in Supplement 2). Furthermore, a recent report suggested that psilocybin may decrease negative affect and the neural correlates of negative affect,56 which may be a mechanism underlying transdiagnostic efficacy. Taken together, these findings suggest that further studies into psychological and neural mechanisms across different psychiatric conditions are warranted The present trial showed that psilocybin administered in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours) produced large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects. The effect sizes reported in this study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy57 and more than 4 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychopharmacological depression treatment studies.58 These findings are consistent with literature that showed that combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy were more efficacious in the treatment of MDD than either intervention alone.59-61 Furthermore, given that psilocybin was associated with nonserious adverse effects that were frequently reported as mild-to-moderate headache and challenging emotions that were limited to the time of sessions (eTables 8 and 9 in Supplement 2), this intervention may be more acceptable to patients than widely prescribed antidepressant medications that confer substantially more problematic effects (eg, suicidal ideation, decrease in sexual drive, and weight gain). The effectiveness of psilocybin therapy after a single or only a few administrations represents another substantial advantage over commonly used antidepressants that require daily administration This study has some strengths. It had a randomized design and used GRID-HAMD as the primary outcome measure that was assessed by blinded clinician raters. The delayed treatment condition controlled for the possible effects of having been accepted into the trial and for the passage of time between screening and initial follow-up assessments. However, the delayed treatment condition did not control for other aspects of psilocybin administration, such as preparation and rapport building, postsession integration meetings, or expectancy effects. Although placebo and active treatment controlled designs are widely used in therapeutic trials,62 they too have limitations owing to the highly discriminable effects of psilocybin This study has some other limitations. It had a short-term follow-up, a small sample that was predominantly composed of White non-Hispanic participants, and included participants with low risk of suicide and moderately severe depression. Further research with larger and more diverse samples, longer-term follow-up, and a placebo control is needed to better ascertain the safety (eg, abuse potential of psilocybin, suicide risk, and emergence of psychosis) and efficacy of this intervention among patients with MDD. Another limitation is the psychotherapy approach31 that involved session facilitators from a variety of professional disciplines (eg, social work, psychology, psychiatry) and session facilitators without formal clinical training (eg, research assistants and clinical trainees). The type of psychotherapy offered and the characteristics of therapists should be explored in future studies.","Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects among patients with MDD. These data expand the findings of previous studies involving patients with cancer and depression as well as patients with treatment-resistant depression by suggesting that psilocybin may be effective in the much larger population of MDD. Further studies are needed with active treatment or placebo controls and in larger and more diverse populations."
25,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.11.010,"Contemporary therapeutic research with classic psychedelics has shown promising effects for both cancer-related psychological distress, and addiction to both tobacco and alcohol. In addition, basic scientific studies using classic psychedelics have led to numerous advances in the experimental study of mystical experiences and the study of classic psychedelic mechanisms of action. Perhaps most importantly, neurobiological studies of the effects of classic psychedelics have yielded insights into the biological basis of consciousness. Specifically, these studies collectively suggest the possibility that the pattern and structure of communication between brain networks constitutes the neurobiological basis of consciousness, such that alterations of consciousness are driven by alterations of communication between brain regions. Interestingly, large-scale epidemiological studies of naturalistic classic psychedelic use are consistent with contemporary clinical research, and point to intriguing future trends, namely the application of classic psychedelics in forensic setting Promising recent results have been published for cancer-related psychological distress, using both psilocybin and LSD, replicating one major focus of the earlier era of classic psychedelic research. Many of these studies have shown such findings using rigorous double-blind procedures that vary in methods. Consistent signals of efficacy in the face of such variations suggest a robust clinical response. In the United States, if future phase 3 research supports these preliminary findings showing the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of cancer-related psychological distress, non-research therapeutic use of psilocybin, under appropriately restricted safeguards adhering to strict safety standards (Johnson et al., 2008), may eventually warrant regulatory approval. Additionally, pilot research on treatment-resistant depression also shows preliminary promise in response to classic psychedelic treatment outside of the context of cancer. If such findings are demonstrated in randomized studies, classic psychedelics may be poised as breakthrough medications for the leading cause of worldwide disability, affecting over 300 million human beings (World Health Organization, 2017). Although the clinical research agenda on addictions is at a lesser stage of development in comparison to cancer-related psychological distress, with only open-label pilot studies having been completed thus far in contemporary research (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2014), if randomized clinical trials continue to suggest safety and efficacy, clinical approval of the use of psilocybin for the treatment of specific addiction may also be on the horizon If safety and efficacy are sufficiently demonstrated to warrant approved therapeutic use of one classic psychedelic (e.g., psilocybin, LSD), this would suggest the potential therapeutic potential of additional compounds of the same class. In the typical clinical development of other drug classes (e.g., benzodiazepines), a seminal compound of the class is identified and developed for therapeutic use (e.g., chlordiazepoxide), followed by the discovery and therapeutic development of additional compounds of the class over the subsequent decades. However, the clinical development of classic psychedelics may be unique, in that hundreds of psychoactive compounds related to this class have already been identified (e.g., Shulgin and Shulgin, 1991; Shulgin and Shulgin, 1997). Therefore, the broad array of classic and novel psychedelic compounds that have been universally ignored in pharmaceutical drug development may soon constitute a library of potential therapeutics. They may also help to inform the biological mechanisms of human consciousness.",
26,10.1007/s00213-015-4162-0,"By exploring the effects of ayahuasca intake on mindfulness capacities, the present study aimed to better understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca. Our findings indicate that ayahuasca intake leads to a rapid increase in several mindfulness-related parameters. Two FFMQ facets changed after ayahuasca, suggesting a decrease in the judgmental processing of personal experiences, along with a reduction in inner reactivity. Additionally, decentering ability was also increased after ayahuasca intake. These combined modifications provide an explanatory mechanism that could contribute to the beneficial effects reported for ayahuasca in the treatment of addiction and depression (Thomas et al. 2013; Osório et al. 2015). It is worth mentioning that prior studies showing benefits associated with long-term ayahuasca use have the confounding factor of participants being members of a religious group (Fábregas et al. 2010; Bouso et al. 2012). The present results obtained in a lay setting support the notion that ayahuasca may have therapeutic potential per se in the absence of the religion confound The scores in some mindfulness capacities observed after ayahuasca are analogous to those of experienced meditators (Soler et al. 2014a). Thus, Soler and colleagues report the following average scores in their experienced meditator sample: “Non-react”, 24.84; “Non-judge”, 30.61; EQ, 41.07; and MINDSENS, 3.70. These values are very close and in some cases lower than those obtained here in the post-ayahuasca assessment “Non-react”, 25.56; “Non-judge”, 33.16; EQ, 41.41; MINDSENS, 3.66. The similar values obtained in the MINDSENS are a relevant finding. The MINDSENS index was created with those FFMQ and EQ items that were more sensitive to meditation practice. This index is sensitive to several aspects of meditation practice, i.e., to the overall years of practice and to the frequency and length of meditative sessions (Soler et al. 2014a). Our study indicates that improvements in mindfulness capacities are not exclusive of mindfulness meditation practice, as they can also be obtained by a pharmacological intervention Our results showed that not all mindfulness facets are equally affected by ayahuasca. Analogously, previous studies comparing meditators vs. non-meditators suggested that not all mindfulness facets are equally modified by practice. For example, in a study comparing a large sample of meditators (n = 384) to individuals without meditative experience (n = 286), the first group scored significantly higher in all FFMQ facets and decentering. However, certain facets such as “Observe”, “Non-react”, and “Decentering” appear to be more sensitive than the others to formal meditation practice (Soler et al. 2014a, b). Increased ability to “Observe” has been pointed out as essential capacity of meditating individuals (Lilja et al. 2012). Out of the five facets of the FFMQ, significant changes were observed in the “Non-judge” and “Non-react” facets Mindfulness is considered a two-factor construct comprising both attentional and attitudinal elements (Bishop et al. 2004). The “Non-judge” and “Non-react” subscales are considered to measure acceptance (Baer et al. 2006). Thus, ayahuasca would particularly foster acceptance of the thoughts and feelings experienced by the individual. This increased self-acceptance could contribute to the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca, as suggested by Thomas (Thomas et al. 2013). Indeed, a state of increased self-acceptance would be clinically useful, since the attitudinal component of mindfulness, rather than the attentional, appears to be particularly impaired in patients with psychopathology (Coffey et al. 2010; Tejedor et al. 2014) The ayahuasca experience may induce an introspective exposure to emotional memories (Riba et al. 2001, 2006), similar to that used in emotional reprocessing interventions (Foa et al. 1995). As intended in such interventions, the use of ayahuasca may promote a detached relationship with one’s own emotions. This detached manner of approaching the inner experience has been defined as “decentering” or “defusion”, understood as the metacognitive ability to take a detached view of one’s own thoughts and emotions. It allows patients to consider thoughts and emotions as objective temporary events of the mind, rather than statements that are necessarily true (Fresco et al. 2007a) Deficits in decentering have been postulated as a trans-diagnostic index of psychopathology. Compared to healthy controls, it is diminished in individuals with cocaine use disorders, eating disorders, major depression, and borderline personality disorder (Soler et al. 2014a). Increases in decentering have been observed after cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and also after mindfulness-based interventions (Bliss and McCardle 2013; Hayes-skelton et al. 2014). Similar to a study in which increases in decentering were reported in a group of patients responding to antidepressant treatment (Fresco et al. 2007b), our data show that psychotropic substances, in our case ayahuasca, can also enhance this ability. Increases in this capacity would explain findings suggesting that ayahuasca has therapeutic effects in depression (Sanches et al. 2015; Osório et al. 2015), a disorder in which the decentering capacity is impaired (Teasdale et al. 2002; Segal et al. 2006; Carmody et al. 2009 Our results are in line with the recent research exploring the therapeutic potential of other psychedelic 5-HT2A agonists, substances which in recent years are receiving renewed attention in psychiatry (Sessa and Johnson 2015). For instance, psilocybin was safely administered to advanced-stage cancer patients and proved effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms related to illness (Grob et al. 2011). Promising results have also been reported for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), another classic psychedelic (Gasser et al. 2014). From a mechanistic perspective, these drugs show modulatory activity on the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex following acute administration (Vollenweider and Kometer 2010; Kraehenmann et al. 2014). These areas are key structures of the emotional brain and their function is deregulated in affective disorders (Pezawas et al. 2005). Regular use of psychedelics has also been associated with differences in brain structure relative to non-users. In a study assessing long-term ayahuasca users, the authors found thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key hub of the default mode network (Raichle et al. 2001). Thinning in the PCC inversely correlated with prior use of ayahuasca and with scores on self-transcendence (Bouso et al. 2015). This personality trait, which comprises religiousness, spirituality, and transpersonal feelings, was higher in ayahuasca-using subjects. No differences were found with controls with regard to neuropsychological functioning or indicators of psychopathology. This finding suggested that regular ayahuasca use may lead to default mode network deactivation, which is overactive in depression (Sheline et al. 2010). Analogously, conventional mindfulness practice also has an impact on the default mode network (Taylor et al. 2013), indicating further commonalities between the ayahuasca experience and mindfulness training. Although to our knowledge, studies with other psychedelics have not specifically examined modifications in mindfulness capacities, it is possible that psilocybin and LSD also show these facilitating effects. Future studies with these substances should explore this possibility The current findings should be taken as preliminary, as the study was intended as exploratory and has some limitations that need to be considered. First, the characteristics of the participant sample and its relatively limited size could be biasing our results. Prior exposure to ayahuasca may have led to a ceiling effect, as suggested by the increases in significance obtained in the repeated measures ANCOVA for “Non-Judge” and “Non-react” subscales. On the other hand, it can be argued that the fact that a single ayahuasca dose increases mindfulness capacities in experienced users who were already more “mindful” than the general population (as shown for instance by the EQ pre-administration values), underscores the power of ayahuasca to enhance these abilities even when the baseline level is high. Although participants manifested being free of any current psychiatric or medical condition, no rigorous criteria were applied to exclude subjects with past diagnoses of mental disorders. The absence of a control group also limits the generalization of the present findings. However, FFMQ facets and decentering appear to be stable over time (Veehof et al. 2011; Soler et al. 2014b). This makes it unlikely that our results are due to natural fluctuations of these variables, rather than the consequence of ayahuasca intake. Lastly, only one dose of ayahuasca was ingested, although the subjective effects of ayahuasca are dose-dependent (Riba et al. 2001). Future studies should explore the impact of different doses and be conducted using randomized controlled designs In summary, the present study provides evidence supporting the claim that ayahuasca has therapeutic potential. The present findings additionally suggest that this is due to increases in mindfulness-related capacities. Further research is warranted to corroborate these results, to test whether the benefits induced by ayahuasca on mindfulness capacities are maintained over time. Positive results would argue strongly in favor of conducting studies involving psychiatric populations.",
27,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.03.010,"This article has revisited the so-called entropic brain hypothesis (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). It has cited increasing empirical support for the idea since it was originally published in early 2014 (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014) and highlighted a particularly promising measure of brain entropy, Lempel-Ziv, that has proved to be informative about conscious level in disorders of consciousness (Casali et al., 2013), pharmacologically induced loss of consciousness (Schartner et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2001) and psychedelic-induced consciousness ‘enrichment’ (Schartner et al., 2017). It has attempted to tackle the question of what increased entropy in the brain relates to in terms of conscious experience, proposing that richness of conscious experience, information content and subjective uncertainty are all close relatives - if not direct counterparts - of increased brain entropy (at least within a critical zone). Specific challenges for the entropic brain theory, and ideas about how it may be tested and advanced, were discussed. Two specific examples were provided of how the entropic brain might be clinically applied, i.e. through using psychedelics to facilitate emotional insight and/or treat disorders of consciousness. The former may be likened to the use of free-association in psychoanalysis, where an open, free-flowing mindstate is encouraged so that the liklihood of spontaneous insight is enhanced. Closing sections focused on properties of criticality in the brain and how these may be accentuated under psychedelics (Atasoy et al., 2017) as well as recent advances in serotonin research that chime well with the entropic brain and may be usefully combined with it to solve a major riddle in psychopharmacology, namely what is brain serotonin for? The proposed solution being: to differentially encode behavioural responses to uncertainty. See (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) for a more focused discussion of this matter Like the original entropic brain paper (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), this updated version can be considered speculative and forward looking. This approach is vulnerable to critique (Papo, 2016) but may also be a strength. It is worth reflecting that the major arguments and hypotheses of the original entropic brain paper have stood up well to empirical scrutiny, e.g. that brain entropy is enhanced under psychedelics (Lebedev et al., 2016; Schartner et al., 2017; Tagliazucchi et al., 2014; Viol et al., 2017) and that the ‘psychedelic-brain’ exhibits more pronounced signatures of criticality than normal waking consciousness (Atasoy et al., 2017) It may be noted however, that some of the themes and terminology used in the original paper, e.g. ‘primary and secondary consciousness’, ‘the ego’ and the default-mode network, have been omitted from the present contribution. There is no conscious agenda behind this, other than a desire to focus on the most pertinent and timely topics, done in the interests of parsimony and concision. What is left out of the present paper should not be considered ‘retracted’ but rather side-stepped for the time being, in the interests of expediency. It should be clearly stated however, that the position that psychedelic research offers a unique opportunity for major principles of psychoanalytic theory to be tested, verified and revived is still very much maintained. There is a door ajar here for psychoanalytically-minded experimental psychologists and neuroscientists to open and walk through “Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” (Carl Jung)“These substances [psychedelics] function as unspecific amplifiers that increase the energetic niveau in the psyche and make the deep unconscious dynamics available for conscious processing. This unique property of psychedelics makes it possible to study psychological undercurrents that govern our experiences and behaviors to a depth that cannot be matched by any other methods and tools available in modern mainstream science.” (Stanislav Grof) Briefly, one specific hypothesis contained in the original paper (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014) that has not stood the test of time, can now be revised, namely that the brain during seizure is sub-critical in relation to normal waking consciousness; in fact, evidence suggests it is super-critical (Meisel et al., 2012) – which, with the benefit of hindsight, makes much more sense About the specific limitations of the present paper, it has been selective in its focus, and unlike the original (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), has said little about other altered states of consciousness in which entropy may be elevated above the normal waking baseline. Befitting its richer content and emotional tone, it has been shown that REM sleep is more entropic than NREM sleep (Abasolo et al., 2015; Burioka et al., 2005) but what about psychosis? The variegated nature of this disorder means we must be cautious about making too general and therefore misleading statements about it. For example, we can speculate that whereas entropy/uncertainty/content may be elevated in manic states (e.g. see Thomasson et al., 2002) and early and acute psychotic episodes, it may be suppressed once a fixed delusion has formed – and/or an antipsychotic and/or mood-stabilising medication is introduced and becomes effective – for example see (Méndez et al., 2012) for evidence of decreased brain entropy after treatment with mirtazapine for depression Also, while the literature is replete with studies applying entropy/complexity measures to EEG data recorded in the context of anaesthetics and sedatives, it is surprisingly difficult to find studies in which the same measures have been applied to EEG data recorded after acute administration of a stimulant (although see - Sun et al., 2007). Stimulants would be particularly interesting controls for psychedelics, in terms of demonstrating the specificity of the proposed relationship between brain entropy and richness of conscious experience and subjective uncertainty. Until such comparisons are made, it is not possible to reject the possibility that brain entropy is merely an index of “alertness” or “arousal” – as has been suggested previously (Mateos et al. 2018) – although indirect evidence tentatively suggests that this alternative explanation is not compelling (Sun et al., 2007; Liu et al., 1997; Zarjam et al., 2012). It seems more reasonable to suppose however, that altered states of consciousness induced by non-serotonergic psychedelics, deliriants and/or dissociatives, that share some of the phenomenological features the classic serotonergic psychedelics, e.g. enriched and changeable contents of consciousness and a sense of uncertainty, might also exhibit heightened entropic brain activity, as was recently demonstrated with the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine for example (Schartner et al., 2017) Another limitation of the present paper is that although explicit mention has been given to the Lempel-Ziv measure (Schartner et al., 2015), only general statements about it have been made - for greater detail see (Schartner et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2001). For example, perhaps there are reasons to focus on the compressibility of signals detected from specific spatial locations when studying specific subjective phenomena (e.g. occipital sensors and visual phenomena) or to improve the temporal precision of our sampling so as to more accurately map between neurophysiological and phenomenological events or epochs – as discussed above. It is hoped that more nuanced hypotheses arising from the entropic brain theory can be tested in the future Relatedly, brain entropy has been treated here as a global brain phenomenon but there are reasons to be believe that spatial localisation is relevant to both the action of psychedelics and the neurobiology of consciousness. For example, the serotonin 2A receptors that appear to be the key trigger receptors for the psychedelic experience (Nichols, 2016) have their densest expression in high-level cortical regions belonging to the default-mode network (Beliveau et al. 2017) and this network, as well as other fronto-parietal networks, have been closely implicated in consciousness regulation (Guldenmund et al., 2016) – as they have in the psychedelic state (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016b; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b) Another key issue deserving of focus before closing, is the matter of the relationship between entropy and criticality. It seems reasonable to infer that such a relationship exists but nothing specific has yet been said about this. Is it more accurate to describe the psychedelic brain as ‘critical’ or ‘dynamically instable’ than ‘entropic’? Is there a limit to the rule that increased brain entropy relates to increased richness of conscious content? The answer to this last question is “probably yes”, and more specifically, it seems likely that there is a zone of criticality (Moretti and Munoz, 2013) above which any further increases in brain entropy create a state of mind and brain that is incapable of integrating information into coherent ‘wholes’ (Gallimore, 2015). Anecdotal reports of complete and/or near-complete loss of consciousness under psychedelics can be found (https://erowid.org/experiences/) but are rare. Thus, generally speaking, the entropic brain principle, that increased brain entropy relates to an increased richness of conscious experience, may be said to stand, but only within an upper as well as a lower limit (Fig. 1). It is interesting to reflect that identifying the point at which conscious awareness is lost with psychedelics may be informative about consciousness itself - in the same way that anaesthetic-induced loss of consciousness has been well used to study consciousness so effectively. Questions about the ethics and safety of giving sufficiently high enough doses of psychedelics to achieve loss of consciousness may preclude this work from ever being done however - at least for the foreseeable future; although potent short-acting psychedelics such as DMT and 5-MeO-DMT may help surmount this issue. Another intriguing question is whether so-called “access consciousness” is more readily lost than “phenomenal consciousness” (Block, 2005) in the extreme, high-entropy psychedelic state Finally, but importantly, it must be conceded that applying entropy measures to brain physiology is not a new endeavour (Klonowski et al., 1999; Nandrino et al., 1994; Papo, 2016; Zhang et al., 2001) and theories on the relationship between brain functional complexity and subjective experience have a history that should be properly acknowledged (Barttfeld et al., 2015; Basar and Guntekin, 2009; Seth et al., 2011; Tononi and Edelman, 1998; Tononi et al., 1994). Perhaps the most influential theory on the brain basis of consciousness, is the so-called ‘integrated-information theory’ of consciousness (Tononi et al., 2016), and this includes as one part of it, a measure of brain entropy/complexity. Indeed, it has been said in a critique of the original entropic brain paper that entropy/complexity measures applied to brain function merely ‘depurate’ the integration term from the integrated-information theory (Papo, 2016). This charge is readily accepted but the position is taken here that the entropy/complexity component of the integrated-information theory provides the major share of its explanatory power. This position is empirically substantiated, since it is arguably the complexity/entropy more than the integration measures per se that are so impressively predicting conscious level (Casali et al., 2013; Casarotto et al., 2016; Schartner et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2001). While the requirement for integration is not disregarded (e.g. see the discussion on entropy and criticality in the previous paragraph) and may indeed by critical for access consciousness particularly – it is felt that the key properties of such integration, necessary for consciousness, have not yet been clearly delineated - although see the Global Workspace theory (Baars, 1993) for an appealing model on the importance of integration to conscious experience, as well as more recent work on large-scale (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016a) and long-range connectivity (Kotchoubey et al., 2013). It also remains possible that a role for integration may be implied within entropy/complexity measures; for example, future work may discover the point or zone within which entropy exceeds a critical threshold at which no one coherent, large-scale spatiotemporal configuration can dominate the brain for a sufficiently long-enough for access consciousness to be possible All models are incomplete and the entropic brain is no exception - but it was conceived and intended to offer a simple and useful heuristic, enabling relatively seamless translations to be made between a quantitative measure of the richness of brain activity and the richness of subjective experience.","In summary, four years on from the publication of the original entropic brain hypothesis, the present paper has sought to reflect on its influence, reliability and future scientific and clinical value. The position is maintained that entropy represents a uniquely powerful bridging tool for human neuroscience that will enable a better understanding of the mind-brain relationship and mechanics of consciousness, including how we may treat its abnormalities."
28,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.12.040,"Psychedelics have a long history of use and yet they attract emotive and often polarised opinions in modern Western society. History suggests they may have a place in the treatment of refractory neurotic disorders, particularly depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, addictions and in the psychological challenges associated with death and dying. Psychedelics appear to have a context-dependent effect. This mandates carefully designed trials within safe and comfortable settings staffed with psychotherapists and psychiatrists familiar with their use Whilst modern pilot studies (largely using psilocybin) have shown promise, treatments with classical psychedelics will need to stand up to the scrutiny of the RCT design, which itself poses significant challenges. The money to finance RCTs with psychedelics will likely come from a mixture of profit-driven commercial enterprises, charitable organisations, crowd-funding and government. The aim of RCTs is to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If safety and efficacy is confirmed, licensing and rescheduling will likely follow. At this point, psychedelics will need to demonstrate deliverability and cost-effectiveness if they are to become established and accepted treatments. Many treatments fail these tests. Delivery of psychedelics in real-world healthcare is likely to be expensive relative to other interventions, underlining our opinion that they are best investigated as options for those with socioeconomically costly psychiatric problems (such as treatment resistant depression) that are refractory to cheaper and more established therapies.",
29,10.1007/s13311-017-0542-y,"The current state of modern research suggests considerable therapeutic promise for psilocybin. This research is most advanced regarding the treatment of cancer-related psychiatric distress, with three randomized, placebo-controlled trials showing promising results for psilocybin [38,39,40]. Two of these trials involved a moderate number of participants and administered relatively large doses of psilocybin [39, 40]. These two studies, in particular, provide strong evidence showing substantial decreases in depressive and anxious symptoms that appear to persist for at least 6 months after a single active treatment. Such results are unprecedented in psychiatry. The single open-label study of treatment-resistant depression outside the context of cancer provides initial preliminary evidence that persisting antidepressant effects of psilocybin might not be limited to those with cancer [42]. If future trials with larger numbers of participants continue to show such persisting therapeutic effects and a favorable adverse effect profile, psilocybin may garner regulatory approval for use as a medicine in the USA and other nations. If approval is obtained, regulations governing clinical use should closely mirror the screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up procedures used in research studies to maximize efficacy and minimize medical and behavioral risks Psilocybin in the treatment of addiction is currently at an earlier stage of research, with two recent open-label, pilot studies, one for tobacco smoking cessation and one treating alcohol dependence, suggesting potential safety and efficacy. Both of these lines of addiction research are being followed up with larger, randomized studies. If these trials continue to show safety and efficacy, a similar medications development pathway as described for cancer-related psychiatric distress could be anticipated. Although clinical approval for either cancer-related psychiatric distress treatment or addiction treatment do not depend on identification of mechanisms of action, it seems very likely that advancing knowledge of both biological and psychological mechanisms underlying efficacy would lead to advances that improve treatment outcomes The US federal funding agencies have yet to support therapeutic psilocybin research. This is understandable given the complex social history surrounding classic psychedelics, and their perceived association with cultural changes that took place in the 1960s and early 1970s. However, as compelling evidence mounts for safety and efficacy, it will be important for government agencies to take a leadership role in supporting cautious and scholarly research on classic psychedelic therapeutics. The recent research with psilocybin, especially evidence of long persisting therapeutic effects that may stem from a single medication administration, suggests that therapy with classic psychedelics may constitute a major new area of medicine that might eventually alleviate suffering across multiple potential disorders.",
30,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2016.03.002,"As described above, acute ayahuasca intake leads to a transient modified state of awareness characterized by introspection, visions, and autobiographic and emotional memories (Riba et al., 2001). Both naïve and regular ayahuasca users have described the experience as positive and valuable, and some individuals have reported health improvements associated with ayahuasca intake (Loizaga-Velder, 2013, Barbosa et al., 2009). Reports of decreased consumption of alcohol, cocaine and other addictive drugs are common in regular ayahuasca users (Fabregas et al., 2010, Thomas et al., 2013). Anecdotal data also suggest an antidepressant effect for ayahuasca (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2014, Schmid, 2014). These testimonies have stimulated research into the potential benefits of ayahuasca in the treatment of substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions The available literature examining the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca can be classified into three main groups. In a first group we find studies on the molecular mechanisms of ayahuasca alkaloids: receptor binding studies and in vitro assays, as well as pharmacological studies in animal models. This group of investigations has examined the mechanisms of action that could explain the psychotropic effects of ayahuasca and the beneficial effects described by users. The second group of studies includes case reports describing beneficial effects in psychiatric symptomatology. Disorders include substance use disorders, anxiety and depression. However, most of these papers provide information from few subjects usually taking ayahuasca in the context of a religious group. This confounding factor has raised doubts as to whether beneficial effects can be attributed exclusively to ayahuasca. The third and more recent group of reports includes case-control studies and open label trials with psychiatric inpatients. These new investigations constitute a step forward in terms of methodological rigor, but designs are still not ideal, as will be discussed below As mentioned in previous sections, ayahuasca is a complex mixture of alkaloids. Thus, the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in its therapeutic effects are numerous Agonism of DMT at the 5-HT2A receptor sites may already have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. This has been shown in animals using the selective agonist DOI (Masuda and Sugiyama, 2000, Nic Dhonnchadha et al., 2003). This possibility is supported by the success of recent therapeutic trials that have used various psychedelics which have the common feature of stimulating this receptor (Grob et al., 2011, Gasser et al., 2015). In addition to increased glutamatergic transmission and rapid electrophysiological changes, agonism at this level has been shown to stimulate BDNF release and neurogenesis (Baumeister et al., 2014). These slower secondary events may also play a role in the beneficial effects of 5-HT2A agonists The recently uncovered modulatory role of DMT at the orphan receptor sigma-1 receptor (S1R) (Fontanilla et al., 2009) could also be involved in the effects of ayahuasca. As discussed above, the SR1 is a chaperone receptor promoting neural plasticity. Long-term exposure to ayahuasca could potentially lead to neural changes mediated through this mechanism The pharmacology of the beta-carbolines can be directly associated with therapeutic effects in depression and anxiety. MAO inhibition is a known therapeutic approach to treat these disorders. All three major beta-carbolines, harmol, harmalol and tetrahydroharmol have MAO-inhibiting properties (Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977a). Additionally, THH is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977b). Inhibition of the serotonin transporter is the main pharmacological mechanism of many of the antidepressants currently used in clinical practice. Increased monoamine concentrations in the synapse following ayahuasca intake could contribute to the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of B. caapi preparations. Harmine is also known to inhibit DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A) in a potent and specific manner (Adayev et al., 2011). This kinase that affects neurite formation and maturation is up-regulated in Down Syndrome as a result of the trisomy (Mazur-Kolecka et al., 2012) Halpern et al. (2008) reported a remission of drug or alcohol abuse/dependence in an ayahuasca community sample (6.5 years average of membership). In another case series study (Thomas et al., 2013), the authors found statistically significant reductions in cocaine use after an ayahuasca-assisted therapy in a sample of members of a First Nations community in Canada with no prior experience with ayahuasca. They also reported improvements in mindfulness, empowerment, hopefulness, quality of life-outlook and quality of life-meaning. Similar effects on substance use were found in two case-control studies (Fabregas et al., 2010, Grob et al., 1996). Grob et al. (1996) reported remission of alcohol, depressive, or anxiety disorders and changes in behavior, attitude toward others and outlook on life in a 15 long-term sample of ayahuasca users, compared to 15 matched controls with no prior history of ayahuasca ingestion. Fabregas et al. (2010) reported an improvement in alcohol use and cessation of drug use (except cannabis) in two groups of jungle and urban-based ayahuasca users compared to non ayahuasca users. These findings were maintained at one-year follow-up. Other descriptive studies, such as observational pilot studies, reports and informal interviews (i. e. Bouso and Riba, 2014; Doering-Silveira et al., 2005; Labate et al., 2014), have presented preliminary evidence, suggesting a potential beneficial role for ayahuasca in the treatment of substance use disorders As regards anxiety and depression, Barbosa et al. (2005) reported reductions in associated symptomatology after a first consumption of ayahuasca in a sample of Santo Daime members. They also reported behavioral changes, such as increased assertivity, vivacity and joy in members of two groups of ayahuasca users: the União do Vegetal and the Santo Daime. A case-control study (dos Santos et al., 2007) used psychometric measures of anxiety, panic-like and hopelessness in regular (10 years) ayahuasca users, members of the Santo Daime. While under the acute effects of ayahuasca, participants scored lower on the scales for panic- and hopelessness-related states, but no modification of state- or trait-anxiety was reported following ayahuasca ingestion More recently, two open-label trials (Osorio et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016) evaluated the effects of a single dose of ayahuasca in psychiatric depressive inpatients. Osorio et al. (2015) observed statistically significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores (HAM-D, MADRS, and the Anxious-Depression subscale of the BPRS) between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after the administration. Furthermore, ayahuasca administration did not trigger episodes of mania or hypomania as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Neither did it lead to increases in the Thinking disorder subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). In a subsequent study by the same group (Sanches et al., 2016), the authors reported significant decreases in scores on the same depression scales (HAM-D, MADRS, BPRS- Anxious-Depression), from 80 min after administration to day 21. No effects were observed on the YMRS and Activation BPRS subscale. Nevertheless, they reported increases in dissociative symptoms as measured by the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). The study included a SPECT assessment that found increased blood perfusion in the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area, a series of brain regions related to the regulation of mood and emotional states.","Ayahuasca has a long history of ceremonial use and its recent worldwide expansion is providing an unprecedented opportunity to study its impact on human health. An increasing number of papers suggest reasonable safety and benefits in mood and psychiatry symptoms in the areas of substance use disorders, anxiety and depression Preliminary findings on the potential psychological mechanisms associated with therapeutic benefits indicate similarities with mindfulness-based therapy. Ayahuasca appears to enhance self-acceptance and decentering, crucial aspects associated with psychotherapeutic treatment outcome in several psychiatric disorders. From a neural perspective, neuroimaging studies after an ayahuasca intake have reported activation in areas associated with emotional processing and memory formation. These results suggest that similarly to exposure therapies, ayahuasca allows reviewing emotional events, but with increased vividness and sense of “reality”. We postulate that the state induced by ayahuasca could be useful in the treatment of trauma, substance use disorders, impulsive-related disorders, and certain patients suffering from borderline personality disorder More research is warranted in clinical populations, using larger samples, matched comparison groups, randomized designs and blinded raters to confirm its efficacy. Finally, it will be necessary for future studies to implement adequate settings and involve clinicians with specific training to ensure the safety of participants."
31,10.7554/eLife.35082,"Interest in the potential clinical effects of psychedelics is boosted by positive preliminary reports on the safety and tolerability in healthy participants as well as patient populations (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Gasser et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). However, the underlying neuropharmacology psychedelics is scarcely investigated in humans. The current study closes major knowledge gaps in the area by characterizing the effects of the prototypical psychedelic by showing that i) LSD increases GBC across sensory and somatomotor functional networks and reduces GBC in associative networks, which is sensitive to GS removal; ii) time-dependent effects are only found in the interaction with katenserin; iii) GBC in the somatomotor network was associated with subjective effects; iv) LSD-induced effects on GBC and subjective symptoms are linked to the pharmacology of the 5-HT2A receptor; v) innovative gene expression analyses across cortex reveal for the first time a correspondence between specific spatial gene expression patterns and in-vivo pharmacological effects in humans We show across conditions that LSD induces hyper-connectivity predominantly in sensory and somatomotor areas (i.e. the occipital cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the postcentral gyrus). LSD-induced hypo-connectivity was observed across subcortical areas (with the exception of the amygdala and sensory thalamus) as well as cortical areas associated with associative networks (i.e. the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulum, the insula, and the temporoparietal junction) (Figure 1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LSD induces a de-synchronization of associative networks whereas sensory and somatomotor areas exhibit elevated brain-wide shared signal (Anticevic et al., 2014b). This is in line with previous seed-based studies reporting increased V1 resting-state connectivity with the rest of the brain after LSD administration (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). Additionally, decreases of connectivity within the DMN were reported after ayahuasca, a tea containing the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, intake (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015). Furthermore, desynchronization within the DMN was reported after psilocybin infusion measured with magnetoencephalography (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013). As noted, while subcortical areas predominantly show hypo-connectivity under LSD there were key exceptions: the amygdala exhibited brain-wide hyper-connectivity under LSD. Amygdala neurons abundantly express 5-HT2A receptors, and alterations in amygdala activity and connectivity have been hypothesized to be important for potential beneficial clinical effects of psychedelics (Rainnie, 1999; Kraehenmann et al., 2016). Furthermore, results showed that participants with the highest LSD-induced coupling within sensory and somatomotor networks also showed the strongest LSD-induced de-coupling in associative networks. This suggests that LSD-induced alterations in information flow across these networks probably results from linked systems-level perturbations, as opposed to being due to dissociable mechanisms across subjects. This pattern of hyper-and hypo-connectivity may underlie the psychedelic state, suggesting increased processing of sensory information which is not counterbalanced by associative network integrity. Consequently, this may result in an altered state of consciousness whereby internal and external sensory computations are not integrated, leading to psychedelic symptoms A virtually identical pattern of hyper-connectivity in sensory networks and hypo-connectivity in associative networks is revealed when contrasting LSD effects with the condition where LSD is blocked by pre-administration of Ket. This brain-wide net effect of LSD was virtually indistinguishable from LSD vs. Pla condition. Put differently, pre-treatment of LSD with Ketanserin induced only negligible changes compared to LSD vs. Pla, indicating that Ket blocked virtually all LSD-induced alterations in GBC. Ketanserin has high antagonistic properties particularly on the 5-HT2A receptor. Thus, these results indicate that LSD-induced alterations in neural and behavioral effects are highly dependent on stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor (Leysen et al., 1982). This is in line with data on subjective LSD-induced effects which were normalized by Ket pretreatment (Figure 1G) Collectively, these data extend previous studies by revealing that the described pattern of brain-wide dysconnectivity may be directly attributable to stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor. Specifically, the effect can be characterized by brain-wide integration of sensory networks and dis-integration of associative networks, which presumably underlie LSD-induced altered state of consciousness. Furthermore, these data highlight the importance of the 5-HT2A receptor system in LSD-induced neural and behavioral alterations One small study by Tagliazucchi et al. has previously investigated the effects of intravenously administered LSD and reports that association cortices (partially overlapping with the default-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) and the thalamus showed increased GBC under LSD (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). These results are partially contradictory to the data presented in Figure 1. Importantly, this previous study did not quantify the influence of the GS, which likely contains a complex mixture of non-neuronal artefacts (e.g. respiration, which may be increased under LSD [Power et al., 2017; Glasser et al., 2017]). Such artefacts can induce spuriously high statistical association across the brain (Yang et al., 2014; Coyle, 2006). Due to these discrepancies, we studied the data as a function of GS regression to inform how this methodological step affects results (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). These analysis support the observations by Tagliazucchi et al. (2016) when GS was not considered: results showed increased GBC in fronto-parietal, temporal, and subcortical areas (Figure 2). The analysis without GSR showed a positive correlation between hyper- and hypo-connectivity change scores, indicating that participants with the highest LSD-induced hyper-connectivity showed the weakest LSD-induced de-coupling. This was in contrast to results after GS removal. Furthermore, connectivity values with GSR and those without GSR were not significantly correlated within subjects (Figure 2). Notably, without GS regression, LSD-Pla differences were not observed when examining seven functionally pre-defined networks (Figure 7). These data suggest that GS related effects cannot be explained by a mean-shift in connectivity values on average, but instead may reflect a process within each subject One hypothesis is that GSR statistically attenuates non-neural arts and therefore provides a method to better isolate functional networks in pharmacological resting-state connectivity studies (Yang et al., 2014; Coyle, 2006). This interpretation is consistent with the absence of a neural-symptom correlation without GSR. Finally, spatial correlations with gene expression maps (discussed below) were notably attenuated for without GSR. That said, this dataset is not well-suited for drawing conclusions about GSR suitability for pharmacological neuroimaging. In fact, it can be argued that results are more replicable across session 1 and 2 without GSR. However, the statistical phenomenon of ‘artefactual’ replication is not surprising, if one considers that GSR is designed to attenuate sources of spatially pervasive structured artefacts which may persist across sessions; f.e. elevated respiratory artefacts). Put differently, there is a key nuance between ‘noise’ and ‘artefact’. Pure unstructured noise can be signal-averaged out and would not yield a consistent ‘artefactual’ effect. In contrast, ‘structured’ artefact represents a signal that can induce the same spurious effect multiple times (Power et al., 2018; Glasser et al., 2018). Therefore, if a structured artefact is large across both measurements (session 1 and 2), then this artefact will spuriously drive the effect and will be replicable. Experiments that manipulate variables such as breathing rate and vigilance will be key to fully characterize the effects of GSR on pharmacological neuroimaging data and help separate neuropharmacological effects associated with ‘global artefacts’ versus those affecting ‘global neural signal’ (Glasser et al., 2018). Furthermore, there are open knowledge gaps regarding LSD’s effects on neurovascular coupling and the hemodynamic response function properties. This pitfall needs to be addressed in experiments incorporating measures specifically designed to investigate changes in hemodynamic coupling. Here animal studies, which offer the possibility to combine neuronal recordings with simultaneous measurement of hemodynamics, will be critical to help interpret LSD effects inhumans As expected, the GS analyses indicate that a GBC metric is highly sensitive to global shared signal, which is altered under LSD. This raises the question regarding the direction of the LSD-induced effects on association vs. sensory-somatomotor areas. To inform the directionality of LSD modulations of GBC we completed an additional analyses based on seed-based thalamic functional connectivity, which yielded a map that was robust to GS transformations. The reason for this phenomenon is that the thalamus exhibits strong bi-directional brain-wide shared signal. Furthermore, we constructed a conjunction measure that identified baseline (i.e. Pla) thalamic FC that was interpretationally consistent irrespective of GS-related shifts (Figure 4). This seed-based conjunction analysis revealed that LSD-induced changes were consistent after GSR and comparable to GBC effects. Without GS removal, neither the thalamic nor GBC effects converged across metrics. This observation, however, does not rule out the possibility that GS removal in fact attenuates signal components that are neuronal in origin and may be relevant to important LSD-induced properties (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Careful manipulation and measurement of respiratory-related artefacts during pharmacological fMRI is needed to disambiguate the amount of GS variance that relates to neuronal vs. artefactual LSD effects Animal studies suggest distinct temporal phases of LSD pharmacology (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007). Therefore, we investigated the time-dependent effects of LSD on subjective effects as well as on GBC. As shown in Figure 5, subjective effects were highest 180 min after LSD administration and decreased in intensity 250 and 360 min after administration as expected (Passie et al., 2008; Schmid et al., 2015). No differences were found between Pla and Ket+LSD conditions at any time point, with subjective effects in both conditions being very low in intensity (<4.7%). This shows that Ket blocked subjective LSD-induced effects over the whole time course, indicating that subjective effects are most likely attributable to 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. To investigate the time course of LSD-induced effects on GBC, two resting-state scans were analyzed, conducted 75 min (session 1) and 300 min (session 2) after the second drug administration. While no significant differences were observed when comparing session 1 and 2 within the Pla and the LSD condition (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), participants showed significant changes in GBC in session two compared to session one in the Ket+LSD condition. Taken together with time-dependent results observed in the functionally defined networks (Figure 6), the blocking effect of ketanersin is particularly evident in the session one across all networks. Specifically, Ket not only blocks LSD effects in session one but also augments the effects seen in Pla, indicating the opposite mechanism of action from that seen by LSD – namely 5-HT2A receptor antagonism (Leysen et al., 1982; Kometer et al., 2013). On the other hand, it seems possible that there exist two distinct pharmacological time phases as described in animal studies. The first phase may be modulated by 5-HT2A receptor activation and the second phase possibly by D2 receptor activation, as suggested by preclinical work (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005; Marona-Lewicka and Nichols, 2007). This hypothesis of time-dependent complex receptor pharmacology awaits further testing. First, studies are needed to investigate the effect of Ket alone on GBC to verify the preferential effects of 5-HT2A antagonism. Second, studies using pre-treatment of LSD by antagonists on receptors other than 5-HT2A are needed to determine if the second phase is indeed modulated by another receptor system. Lastly, indications of different pharmacological phases are not evident from subjective drug effects which remain completely blocked by Ket. Studies using higher doses of LSD are therefore needed to investigate if the potential effect of LSD’s action on other receptors becomes more pronounced and therefore subjectively accessible The LSD-induced change in connectivity in the somatomotor network correlated significantly with general and specific subjective LSD-induced effects (mean across all scales, blissful state, disembodiment, changed meaning of percepts, elementary imagery, spiritual experience). Participants with increased connectivity in the somatomotor network also showed higher subjective effects. On average, the change in connectivity between the LSD and Pla condition in the somatomotor network was not significant. However, this is likely explained by the heterogeneous connectivity changes within this network: while the pre- and postcentral gyrus predominantly showed increases in GBC, medial areas were hypo-connected. Connectivity changes in other functional networks were not significantly correlated with subjective effects. This points to the importance somatomotor network brain regions and their connectivity with the rest of the brain for psychedelic experiences. This is in line with previous results obtained from task-related data showing that the supplementary motor area is associated with LSD-induced alterations in meaning and personal relevance processing (Preller et al., 2017). These results also support broader theories of consciousness emphasizing the importance of the sensorimotor system for the perception of presence and agency, and therefore a sense of self (e.g., interoceptive predictive coding model of conscious presence (Seth et al., 2011), comparator model (Frith et al., 2000; Allen et al., 2016; Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Furthermore, alterations in sensorimotor gating have been suggested to underlie psychedelic experiences (Quednow et al., 2012; Ludewig et al., 2003). Somatomotor system activity and connectivity has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Anticevic et al., 2014a), an illness characterized by delusions and alterations in the sense of self, potentially arising from alterations in sensorimotor gating deficits in an inferential mechanism that allows distinguishing whether or not a sensory event has been self-produced (Synofzik et al., 2010). The current results corroborate and extend these previous findings by showing that somatomotor network connectivity is also closely associated with an LSD-induced psychedelic state To further investigate LSD’s receptor pharmacology we specifically used the threshold-free Z-score map of LSD effects relative to Ket blockade and Pla. The logic here is that such a map may reflect Ket-specific contributions to LSD blockade, which is hypothesized to involve the 5-HT2A receptor. This map was then correlated with gene expression maps of receptors that may be stimulated by LSD (Nichols, 2004). LSD-induced changes in functional connectivity after GSR exhibited strong positive relationships with HTR2A expression (higher than 95.9% of all possible gene expression correlations, Figure 9). These results show that LSD-induced changes in GBC quantitatively match the spatial expression profile of genes coding for the 5-HT2A receptor, supporting the central role of this receptor system in LSD’s neuronal and subjective effects. LSD-induced changes in functional connectivity were also highly negatively correlated with HTR7 gene expression (lower than 99.8% of all possible gene expression correlations, Figure 9). This can be explained by the highly anti-correlated expression of these two genes (Figure 9). However, it is also possible that the 5-HT7 receptor functionally contributes to LSD-induced effects. In contrast to its agonistic properties on the 5-HT2A receptor, LSD has been reported to be an antagonist in the 5-HT7 receptor (Wacker et al., 2013). Since previous studies have shown that 5-HT7 receptor antagonists have anti-psychotic potential (Waters et al., 2012; Abbas et al., 2009), it seems very unlikely that LSD’s effects have a strong and appreciable contribution on the 5-HT7 receptor. However, future studies should examine 5-HT7 receptor pharmacology more carefully as they may reveal a role of this receptor system in pro-cognitive effects that contrast those of LSD. While the current results strongly implicate the involvement of the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD-induced effects, it must be noted that no further conclusions can be drawn regarding the functional contribution of other receptors agonized or antagonized by LSD. This limitation needs further investigation in future studies by blocking serotonin and dopamine receptors involved in the pharmacology of LSD beyond the 5-HT2A receptor. Furthermore, the contribution of these receptors to the effects of different doses of LSD still need to be studied. Finally, we show that the spatial match between gene expression maps and GBC maps is significantly improved after GSR, even though correlation coefficients in particular for DRD1, DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2C remain moderate. These results also highlight the validity of this approach as a general method for relating spatial gene expression profiles to neuropharmacological manipulations in humans. An important next step allowing further methodological validation is comparing LSD-induced alterations in GBC with receptor maps provided by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Saulin et al., 2012; Ettrup et al., 2016; Ettrup et al., 2014), preferably using MR scanners that are both MR and PET compliant allowing for cross-validation across BOLD and PET modalities within the same person","In summary, the current results close major knowledge-gaps regarding the neurobiology and neuropharmacology of LSD. First, we show that LSD induces widespread alterations of GBC in cortical and subcortical brain areas, characterized by a synchronization of sensory and somatomotor functional networks and dis-integration of associative networks. We show that this effect is sensitive to GSR, which has important implications for future pharmacological resting-state studies. Second, we investigated the receptor-pharmacology of LSD, showing that the 5-HT2A receptor plays a critical role in subjective and neuronal LSD-induced effects. However, analyzing the time course of LSD-induced alterations in functional connectivity, it seems likely that at a later phase, modulation by receptors other than the 5-HT2A receptor is involved. The comparison of LSD-induced effects on functional connectivity and receptor-gene expression maps underscores the interpretations of 5-HT2A pharmacology and points to potentially impactful studies on 5-HT7 receptor pharmacology. Lastly, in line with various theories of consciousness we showed that the somatomotor system in particular is related to LSD-induced psychedelic effects. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of psychedelic compounds and offer important directions for development of novel therapeutics."
32,10.1007/s00213-016-4377-8,"The aim of the present study was to further investigate the psychological mechanisms underlying the ayahuasca experience, and specifically whether ayahuasca acutely affects creative thinking. It was shown that during the acute inebriation, ayahuasca caused a decrease in conventional convergent thinking and enhanced creative divergent thinking, as measured by the PCT. All dependent variables associated with the PLMT remained unaffected The ayahuasca-induced enhancement of divergent thinking could potentially be linked to the effects ayahuasca exerts on brain regions involved in creativity. Three core networks, i.e., the default mode network (DMN), including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortices, the central executive network (CEN), including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortices, and the salience network (SN), including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, interact during divergent thinking via corticostriatal-thalamocortical loops (Chávez-Eakle et al. 2007; de Manzano et al. 2010; Fink et al. 2009; Geyer and Vollenweider 2008; Jung et al. 2013; Pinho et al. 2015). The thalamus feeds information into the SN which in turn coordinates the other mentioned networks (Beaty et al. 2016; Uddin 2015). The SN monitors events occurring outside of the body as well as internal consciousness and is able to direct attention to whatever is more important at a certain moment in time. It is suggested that especially these shifts between these externally (CEN) and internally (DMN) oriented cognitive networks are very important in creative divergent thinking (Jung et al. 2013; Perlovsky and Levine 2012). Interestingly, previous research has shown that ayahuasca reduced thalamic gating of sensory and cognitive information (Riba et al. 2002). Taking into account the neuronal pathways previously described, this could lead to an increase in information fed into the salience network. Consistent with this line of thinking is the fact that Riba and colleagues (2006) showed an increase in blood perfusion in the SN after ayahuasca ingestion. Previously, other imaging studies with psychedelics also showed increased blood perfusion or a higher metabolic rate of glucose in the frontal and paralimbic areas during (e.g., anterior insula, anterior cingulate) psilocybin and mescaline (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 1999a, b; Hermle et al. 1992; Riba et al. 2006; Vollenweider et al. 1997). In addition, Alonso et al. (2015) found broad-band power decrements in the EEG signal after ayahuasca compared to placebo. Based on the knowledge about negative correlations between EEG and BOLD (Moosmann et al. 2003), this was interpreted as reflecting increased activation of areas involved in visual processing and in the cognitive-emotional processing anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area that is central to the SN Alonso et al. (2015) also showed a temporary induced disruption of neural hierarchies by ayahuasca, i.e., by reducing top-down control and increasing bottom-up information transfer in the human brain (Alonso et al. 2015). It was suggested that the higher excitability of posterior regions in combination with the loosening of the cognitive grip exerted by frontal regions responsible for executive control may underlie the associations and insights that emerge during the experience (Alonso et al. 2015). Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) also found other parts of these networks to be influenced by ayahuasca, i.e., they showed a decrement in the functional connectivity in parts of the DMN after ayahuasca ingestion (Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015). It was suggested that this could result in more cognitive flexibility and consequently potentially enhanced divergent thinking (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014). However, Petri et al. (2014) suggest that the picture is more complex as they showed that the brain does not become a random system after psilocybin administration but still has stable connections which are different from the placebo state and only present in the psychedelic state (Petri et al. 2014). Likewise, Roseman et al. (2014) showed an increase in between-network resting state functional connectivity under psilocybin across normally distinct brain networks (Roseman et al. 2014). This increased integration between cortical areas could give rise to more associations (Petri et al. 2014) and an increased influence of imagination on visual perception (Roseman et al. 2014). Still, the precise neurobiological underpinning of how psychedelics may enhance divergent creative thinking remains largely unknown, and further research is warranted Convergent thinking can be seen as the second phase in the creative thinking process, i.e., focused on narrowing possibilities to a workable solution after the ideas have been generated through divergent thinking (Hennessey and Amabile 2009). Studies have shown this phase to be associated with an increase in CEN activity (Sowden et al. 2015). In the present study, ayahuasca caused deterioration in convergent thinking. Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) found that ayahuasca only influenced activity in the DMN without changing the connection between DMN and CEN (Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015). The absence of ayahuasca enhancing effects on the CEN, together with the decrease in thalamic gating and loosened cognitive control described by Alonso and colleagues (2015), could explain the negative effect of ayahuasca on convergent thinking (Alonso et al. 2015). However, research with other psychedelics, e.g., psilocybin, showed an increase in functional connectivity between the DMN and the task-positive network or CEN (Carhart-Harris et al. 2013; Roseman et al. 2014) Ayahuasca selectively affected performance in the PCT and not in the PLMT. Anecdotal reports from participants suggest that the stimuli of the PCT elicited more novel thoughts due to their more complex and colorful nature. In contrast, the stimuli in the PLMT contrast were very simple black-and-white line drawings. The latter probably gave less input into the system involved in the generation of new ideas. Another point to be mentioned is the quasi-experimental design of this study which potentially limits the conclusions that can be drawn from it. It could be argued that because ayahuasca sessions always followed the baseline session, and as it is known that ideas can get more creative over time (Beaty and Silvia 2012), a potential order effect could have influenced the results. However, besides the fact that parallel versions of tasks were used in a randomized order to counter potential order effects, the double dissociation, i.e., improvement of divergent thinking and impairment of convergent thinking, suggests that results were not subjected to the serial order effect Previously, it has been shown that the connection between divergent thinking and mood is particularly strong and positive (Baas et al. 2008; Davis 2009), i.e., more positive mood improves divergent thinking. In contrast, convergent thinking and mood are related in a negative way: more positive mood lowers convergent thinking. Mood of participants in the present study was generally very positive, which may have contributed to their openness to creative ideas. Mood ratings were only taken after drinking ayahuasca and could not be compared to mood states before drinking; nonetheless, they differed statistically from 0. In the future, placebo-controlled studies including measures of mood could test whether mood changes are a moderator in the effects of ayahuasca. Another point which could be addressed in future research is the usefulness of ideas generated in the divergent thinking task as this is part of the definition of divergent creative thinking. By including for example a task in which this quality can be assessed, e.g., the “alternate uses task,” it can be tested whether ayahuasca also improves this aspect of divergent thinking It would be interesting and important in the light of potential clinical applications of ayahuasca to investigate whether the effects are stable or also vary in time. It is known that ayahuasca induces an intense modified state of consciousness, starting between 35 and 40 min after administration and lasting approximately 4 h (Frecska et al. 2016). We showed that during this period, divergent thinking was enhanced and convergent thinking distorted. Soler et al. (2015) demonstrated that 24 h after ayahuasca intake, mindfulness-related capacities were enhanced (Soler et al. 2015). Mindfulness, a state of nonjudgmental, sustained, and alert awareness which improves people’s cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal functioning, has been shown to be linked with convergent thinking and less with divergent thinking (Lebuda et al. 2016). Based on these findings, it could be interesting to see whether convergent thinking is recovered 24 h after ayahuasca administration. It is suggested, based on a study of Bouso et al. (2008) on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in post-traumatic stress disorder, that the potential effect pattern of ayahuasca would make it suited for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. The increase in divergent thinking during the acute phase could help patients relive events, recalling various associations without feeling inhibited (Bouso et al. 2008; Frecska et al. 2012, 2016). The sub-acute effects could then be suited in a second, “integration” session in which patients discuss the experiences they had on ayahuasca and find strategies that help them cope with intensive emotions. Future studies should therefore not only focus on either the acute or sub-acute phase but also take both stages into account In the past decade, a renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics has emerged (Anderson 2012; McKenna 2004; Sessa and Johnson 2015). The present study has shown that ayahuasca promotes divergent thinking, an ability which has been shown to be an important aspect in cognitive therapy (Forgeard and Elstein 2014). It can therefore be suggested that ayahuasca possesses qualities that can promote a therapeutic process. However, since convergent thinking is also a critical aspect in therapy, and the current findings show that ayahuasca impairs this facet during the acute phase, future studies have to investigate whether this effect profile changes over time. Additional research utilizing a placebo-controlled experimental design, including additional creativity measures, is warranted, before results can be generalized.

33,10.1177/0022167817706884,"Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is a promising combination intervention for the treatment of psychological distress, psychiatric conditions, and “the betterment of well people” (Bob Jesse, cited in Pollan, 2015). Despite the resurgence in research using psilocybin in recent years, the psychological mechanisms of action involved in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are not yet well understood. Current theory regarding psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic mechanisms of action posits that the occasion of a mystical experience is the primary mediating factor leading to positive treatment outcomes. While the construct of a “complete mystical experience,” for example, as defined by exceeding a cutoff score on the Pahnke–Richards Mystical Experience Questionnaire (Griffiths et al., 2006) has been shown to be one mediator of positive outcomes in randomized controlled trials (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2008; MacLean et al., 2011), the findings of this study suggest a more complex topography. It is conceivable that a single mediating factor is insufficient to account for multilevel phenomena that carry cognitive, emotional, behavioral, psychodynamic, spiritual, existential, and/or experiential components of significance The current study appears to be the first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The findings of this study suggest that there are important relational, bodily, affective, and other aspects of participant experiences that may play critical roles. First, participants universally described deeply meaningful attachments to important family members and significant others. Relationships were woven throughout participant narratives, with themes of forgiveness of others, loved ones as spirit guides, the importance of narrating one’s experience with loved ones, and improved relationships posttreatment. In this way, the psilocybin experience may be conceived as relationally embedded. In many ways, this is unsurprising, given the important contributions of attachment theory (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 2014; Bowlby, 1980, 2005), relational theory (Mitchell, 1988; Wachtel, 2010), and interpersonal theory (Sullivan, 2013) to human development, which have yet to be thoroughly integrated into psychedelic research paradigms. Nearly all participants reported having an experience of love and joy, though these exalted experiences arose primarily through a specific human relationship with another person, whether it was a parent, child, or partner. As Anais Nin (1971) once wrote, “The personal, if it is deep enough, becomes universal, mythical, symbolic” (p. 153). These findings indicate that a relational theoretical framework may have utility in assessing the importance of transformed interpersonal and intrapsychic configurations occasioned by psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Second, the findings of the current study also suggest that embodiment, and especially alterations or transfigurations of normally felt embodied states, is a critical feature of participant experiences. Although participants did describe discarnate phenomena, some of the most compelling accounts spoke of bodily ejections of cancer and visions of accepting their bodies. Participants described enhanced interoceptive awareness, somatic synesthetic experiences, and alterations to their sense of self as embodied beings. Despite a trend toward embodiment as a broad interpretative framework in the social and behavioral sciences (Csordas, 1994; Gibbs, 2005; Niedenthal, Barsalou, Winkielman, Krauth-Gruber, & Ric, 2005), subjectively experienced body states are not currently being assessed in clinical trials with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Third, slightly more than half of participants recounted acute reactions of fear, confusion, panic, or paranoia during the psilocybin dosage session. These were transient processes, and no serious adverse events attributable to the study treatment occurred during the course of this trial. The findings presented here suggest that transient periods of distress, even intense experiences of fear and panic, can be well tolerated by study participants in a supportive therapeutic milieu. The development of a trusting therapeutic alliance between the participant and the study therapists before the psilocybin administration session, followed by adequate integration psychotherapy sessions afterward, provides a crucial supportive context. While a straightforward review may deem experiences of transient psychological distress as undesirable side effects, both participants and the research team came to understand these difficult experiences as part of a necessary and ultimately beneficial process. In the midst of fear and dysphoria, participants described how they came to surrender or “let go,” leading from a defensive posture of emotional or psychological resistance to an accepting posture characterized by feelings of relief, wholeness, freedom, and affirmation. Through a collaborative interpretative process, our research team generated a variety of ways of labeling these transient phenomena, including the following: the shadow, the difficult struggle, the dark night of the soul, wrathful guardians of the gates of the mandala, ego death, heaven and hell, and existential collapse. Each offered certain advantages but also brought with them unwanted baggage from the psychological, theological, and psychedelic traditions from which they were borrowed. Such periods of transient distress may serve as a necessary “turning point” in an unfolding process, as feelings of fear, panic, and anxiety transmute into feelings of love, joy, and forgiveness Fourth, these findings indicate that psilocybin occasions a rich and complex range of human emotions. Participants described powerful and healing catharses suggesting an emotional trajectory. Participant affects have either not been assessed formally in clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, or the range of assessment is limited, as with the use of visual analogue scales assessing feelings of fear, paranoia, and joy (Turton et al., 2014). Our findings suggest that participants may emerge from this treatment having experienced profound emotional depths and expanded affective boundaries. Future research may evaluate cathartic release and the depth and breadth of affect states occasioned during psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy Fifth, participant accounts reveal a colorful, even fantastical range of complex closed-eye visual phenomena. These visions are ideographically instantiated within subjective processes. These complex visualizations are not merely interesting scenes painted on the proscenium curtain of the theater of the mind. Rather, among study participants, these visions served as principle organizing motifs of subjective experience with multifold vectors (e.g., audiovisual, relational, autobiographical, spiritual, epistemological, ontological). Such visions were often deeply coded with layers of meaning by participants Sixth, study participants described lasting impacts to their quality of life, life priorities, and their sense of identity. During their psilocybin experiences, many participants “remembered” aspects of themselves that had been forgotten. They recovered a sense of what is most important and vital in their lives, such as being present in the moment or being kind to other people. Participants described feeling “reborn,” more expansive, more confident, more connected, and more alive. They described a feeling of empowerment and being “unstuck,” with resulting healthier behaviors. As two participants reported significant weight loss, future research regarding the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy as an intervention for obesity and eating disorders may be warranted A number of limitations to this study should be noted. The interview guide focused primarily on the participant experiences during the psilocybin dosage session rather than the preparatory and integration psychotherapy sessions, which we see as essential components. The timing of the interview poses certain concerns, as approximately half the sample were interviewed within 1 week following their second psilocybin dosage session, which allowed little time to review lasting impacts of their experiences but afforded at least one integration psychotherapy session to help consolidate memory and meaning. Conversely, as eight participants were interviewed at approximately 1-year follow-up, the clarity of their recall regarding specific phenomenal experiences a year earlier may have been subject to distortion or clouding. Additionally, the current analysis does not formally address participant–therapist interactions or the nature of therapeutic action as experienced by the patients nor does it address the variety of experiences related to cancer, death, and spirituality reported by this cohort of cancer patients, which is documented in a subsequent article (Swift et al., 2017) This is perhaps the first qualitative study to explore the subjective inner texture of participant experiences of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The findings of the study support the conclusion that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is well accepted by participants and constitutes a promising intervention for the treatment of existential and psychological distress provoked by a cancer diagnosis. An IPA revealed a complex, multilevel set of processes. Participants experience this treatment as relationally embedded, physically embodied, affect laden, deeply meaningful, and biographically instantiated, with lasting impacts to their experience of themselves and the world. Future research is warranted to attend to these and other possible mediating factors in the design of clinical trials to better articulate psychological mechanisms of action and maximize therapeutic benefit.",
34,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.05.012,"All 8 factors and other lines of evidence taken together indicate the profile of a substance that is characterized by some level of abuse potential and potential risks. However, the findings do not support placement more restrictively than Schedule IV. The current placement in Schedule I is presently necessitated by the absence of FDA approval for a psilocybin containing medicine and Schedule I is the only Schedule into which substances of abuse can be placed that do not have an approved medical indication. However, it is the opinion of the authors of this review that the original placement of psilocybin was the result of a substantial overestimation of the risk of harm and abuse potential. The CSA stipulates that Schedule I is for substances with a high potential for abuse, lack of therapeutic approval, and that cannot be used safely in medicine. History of use and available scientific data show that the first criterion is questionable, and the third criterion is likely not true. The second of these criteria can only be negated by FDA approval of a psilocybin-containing products, but at this point the data suggest that the potential therapeutic benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy are real, and of potential medical and public health significance Schedule placement is guided by an analysis of the 8 factors of the CSA that will be drafted by the FDA with input from NIDA. The 8-factor analysis contained in this review should be considered an abbreviated assessment of abuse potential as compared to what would be required by the FDA to accompany the submission of an NDA for approval of a psilocybin containing drug product. Furthermore, considerable additional study will yet be required to support the submission of a complete and reviewable NDA and its abuse potential assessment. This will include at least one major phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety trial that includes assessments relevant to abuse potential, additional Phase 1 and/or 2 clinical studies, and possibly some animal testing (Calderon et al., 2017; Sellers et al., 2017). Thus data yet to be collected will influence the final scheduling proposal that will be made by the sponsor and, in turn by the FDA, NIDA, and DEA. Nonetheless, considerable data from animal self-administration and discrimination studies, and human abuse potential studies since the 1960s provide a substantial basis for the present preliminary evaluation. In contrast to Schedule III drugs and even to many drugs placed in Schedule IV, the reinforcing effects in preclinical studies are marginal. There is no clear evidence of physical dependence and withdrawal in preclinical or clinical studies, or among those who chronically used illicit products. Euphoriant effects can occur under limited circumstances but appear attenuated by dysphoric effects. The doses that pose a risk of acute poisoning death (“overdose”) appear to be approximately 1000 times the likely highest clinical dose to be marketed, psychological dependence resulting in daily use appears rare, and all major drug surveillance systems reviewed in Factors 4, 5, and 6 of this analysis indicate rates of abuse, emergency department reports, and treatment seeking in youth and adults that are substantially lower than are evident for many Schedule IV drugs. It is possible, of course that subsequent study with larger populations and different designs in animals and humans, would yield different outcomes, but this review suggests that psilocybin would be appropriately placed in Schedule IV of the CSA if the FDA approves a psilocybin NDA The authors of this review recognize that opinions in the general population may differ substantially as it is clear that there remains a legacy of fear regarding psychedelics since the 1960s. The role of the 8-factor analysis of the CSA is to bring science to bear to support the foundation for scheduling, implications for other aspects of scheduling which are based on much of the same data. In particular, this means the labeling that will be specific to the label section, Drug Abuse and Dependence (section 9 of the drug labeling), and warnings including the possible requirement of a Boxed Warning (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2017d). As with all approved drug products, determination of safe and effective by the FDA does not mean without risk, and the conclusion that the science does not support scheduling more restrictive than IV does not mean no abuse or dependence risk This analysis has implications for future research with psilocybin and for the possible development of related drugs. Perhaps most challenging and important is research to better understand the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and related drugs that can produce profound and very long lasting positive changes in mood and well-being in people who were resistant to standard care and approved medicines. Given the extent to which undertreated and treatment resistant mental and behavioral disorders, including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, remain serious problems at the personal and societal levels in the US and globally (Belouin and Henningfield, 2018), it could be concluded that the need for such research is urgent The dearth of therapeutic and mechanistic studies of psilocybin and other classic psychedelics over the past half-century does not stem from a lack of interest among psychologists, psychiatrists, pharmacologists and neuroscientists. Research has been and continues to be limited by the provisions of the CSA and the lack of prioritization of such research by potential federal funding agencies. As discussed elsewhere, the barriers to research imposed by Schedule I regulation are formidable and although they do not outright ban such research, the consequence has been that this area of science and potential clinical application has been greatly under-researched (Belouin and Henningfield, 2018; Nutt, 2015; Nutt et al., 2013; Scientific American Editors, 2014; Sinha, 2001; Spillane, 2004; Woodworth, 2011). Several of the key clinical studies have been primarily supported by private foundations rather than federal institutions such as NIH (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2016) The science of drug abuse potential assessment has evolved considerably in recent decades and this is evident in the FDA's 2017 guidance document, “Assessment of Abuse Potential of Drugs,” that summarizes research strategies, and methods and discusses how these can be brought to bear to provide the regulatory science foundation for drug scheduling decisions. The application of this scientific approach to further evaluate the abuse potential of psilocybin provides an example of how this area of regulatory science has the potential to facilitate innovative therapeutic breakthroughs by replacing fear and misinformation with scientifically based conclusions and facts",
35,10.1016/j.tips.2017.08.003,"In summary, we hypothesize that the induction of synapse-related gene expression in key neuronal populations identified by molecular studies and the robust alterations observed in neural circuits by imaging studies are highly interrelated processes (Figure 2). The ability of psychedelic drugs, such as LSD and psilocybin, to cause disruption of established neural connectivity and the emergence of novel functional associations may underlie the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics in a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses [41]. The results of psychedelic research using animal models, such as the induction of specific synapse-associated genes, puts the human neuroimaging findings of markedly altered functional connectivity into a new context. Therefore, biomedical research into psychedelics should take on a more translational nature (Figure 3), in which reverse translation (or bedside to bench) plays a prominent role. Questions remain as to the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the response to psychedelic drugs. For example, why do different brain regions have different transcriptional responses in what appear to be the same cell type? What roles do interneurons and glia play in hallucinogenic behaviors? Investigators can therefore prioritize brain regions that are altered by psychedelic exposure in fMRI studies, such as the visual cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, to further elucidate what molecular and cellular mechanisms may underlie the broad network changes seen in those regions Clearly, many questions remain regarding the biology of these compounds and their use in the clinic (see Outstanding Questions). Drug development in psychiatry has lagged dramatically behind other biomedical disciplines 72, 73, and many of the most commonly used psychiatric medications were discovered serendipitously and often also possess complex adverse effects. Therefore, given the promising results seen in early phase clinical trials with psychedelic drugs for the treatment of addiction, anxiety, and depression, the research community must validate the efficacy of these drugs in more rigorous trials to achieve a better understanding of their mechanisms in the body",
36,10.1038/s41598-017-05407-9,"Here we showed that adult neural stem cell activity is regulated by harmine, THH, and harmaline, the most abundant alkaloids in B. caapi and ayahuasca, and by harmol, the main metabolite of harmine in humans31. Using an in vitro model of adult neurogenesis, we found that all four β-carbolines stimulated the proliferation and migration of progenitor cells and promoted their differentiation predominantly into neurons The four compounds tested effectively promoted proliferation, migration, and differentiation of progenitor cells obtained from the SVZ and the SGZ, the two main niches of adult neurogenesis in rodents. The β-carbolines increased the number and size of primary neurospheres, induced the loss of the neurospheres’ undifferentiated state, and promoted subsequent cell migration and differentiation mainly into a neuronal phenotype, as indicated by the positive expression of β-III-tubulin and MAP2, but also into astroglial cells. Taken together, these three effects indicate that B. caapi alkaloids have the capacity to regulate the expansion and fate of stem cell populations Analysis of the proliferation stage showed that all four β-carbolines increased the number and size of neurospheres, the number of Ki-67-stained cells, and the amounts of Ki-67 and PCNA protein as measured by Western blot. Our results for the effect of harmine on proliferation are in line with a previous study showing harmine-induced increase in mitosis in cultured chick embryo cells32, and in human neural progenitor cells33. To our knowledge, the effects of harmaline and THH on neurogenesis have not been studied before. While harmaline is only present in small amounts in B. caapi, THH is the second most abundant β-carboline in the plant4, 29. Additionally, THH shows more consistent plasma levels between individuals and studies than harmine, which is rapidly degraded to harmol when taken orally29, 34. The latter, formed in vivo by O-demethylation of the parent compound29, showed proliferative effects of similar magnitude to those of harmine Our results showed that B. caapi β-carbolines promoted cellular migration and differentiation, suggesting that these alkaloids not only act as mitogens for neural stem cells, but also modulate cellular fate. The largest effects on migration were observed for harmaline and THH. Increased migration capacity is relevant in certain conditions such as brain injury, where stem cell niches are far from the damaged area35,36,37. All tested compounds also promoted cellular differentiation. Neural stem cells are known to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes23, 24. The observed increases in Tuj-1 and MAP-2 protein expression indicated differentiation predominantly toward a neuronal phenotype. In the SVZ both proteins were equally expressed after each of the four treatments. However, in the SGZ harmine administration did not influence Tuj-1 levels, a marker of immature neurons, but significantly increased the expression of MAP-2, suggesting a larger impact on neuronal maturation All the above indicate that B. caapi β-carbolines facilitate neurogenesis at multiple levels. This capacity is of interest, since in pathological conditions the replacement of neurons may be optimized by acting simultaneously on various processes38, 39. The effect of the β-carbolines on cellular proliferation and differentiation is not unique to these compounds, having been observed for endogenous molecules such as leukotriene B440, BMPs41, the growth factors EGF/FGF242, and NGF/BDNF/bFGF43, and the transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b44. However, the fact that the β-carbolines also stimulated migration highlights the versatility of these exogenous compounds, as they can promote the three processes involved in full adult neurogenesis A likely possible explanation for the observed effects of β-carbolines in neurogenesis is the increase in monoamine levels caused by MAO inhibition. With this said, we must acknowledge that the magnitude of the neurogenic effects was similar for the four compounds, despite harmol and THH being inhibitors that are between a hundred and a thousand times weaker than harmine or harmaline5. Moreover, the role of monoamines in neurogenesis is not fully understood. Knocking out the 5-HT1A receptor in mice impaired neurogenesis after fluoxetine but not after imipramine, indicating that neurogenesis was independent from elevated serotonin levels45. In another study, the authors reported the unexpected finding that serotonin depletion actually promoted hippocampal neurogenesis instead of decreasing it46. In a recent paper, harmine, but not the MAO inhibitor pargyline, stimulated proliferation of human neural progenitor cells in vitro 33. Harmine effects were mediated through inhibition of the DYRK1A kinase rather than through MAO inhibition. This opens the possibility that the β-carbolines tested here regulated stem cell fate via DYRK1A or other alternative mechanisms. To our knowledge, the inhibitory effects of harmaline, tetrahydroharmine and harmol on DYRK1A has not been examined. Other potential molecular targets for the neurogenic effects of small molecules include the modulation of the GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway 47, upregulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor48, increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor49; and glucocorticoid receptor activation50. Future studies should assess whether B. caapi β-carbolines interact with one or more of these pathway Our findings have relevant therapeutic implications. The association between neurogenesis and anti-depressant activity is well documented45, 51. Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis reduces depression-like behaviors in animals51. Furthermore, clinically effective antidepressants stimulate neurogenesis, independent of their chemical structure and mechanism of action. To cite a few examples, chronic treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine increases neurogenesis in rats52, 53, as does chronic treatment with the selective MAO-A inhibitor pirlindole53. The association between neurogenesis and antidepressant effect is not limited to rodents and pharmacological interventions. Electroconvulsive therapy in primates also stimulates proliferation of neural precursors in the hippocampus and their differentiation into neurons54. Hippocampal neurogenesis appears to be necessary for antidepressant action. Irradiation of the SGZ of the hippocampus in mice prevents the neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine and imipramine In humans, two recent clinical studies have demonstrated rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects after a single ayahuasca dose in patients who did not respond to conventional treatment11, 12. The therapeutic potential of ayahuasca is an area of increasing research interest beyond depression55. Alterations in adult neurogenic niches have been associated with a number of pathologies affecting the central nervous system56,57,58,59. Stimulation of these niches is currently being investigated as a novel therapeutic strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders60,61,62. Regular ayahuasca use has been associated decreases in problematic alcohol, cocaine and opiate consumption, indicating anti-addiction properties for B. caapi preparations63, 64. These potential anti-addictive properties are particularly relevant if we acknowledge the notorious difficulty of treating substance use disorders. Drug-dependent patients not only show functional deficits in reward processing and cognitive control, but also structural alterations in brain gray and white matter Our study has a series of limitations that need to be acknowledged. Ayahuasca brews contain other active compounds that were not tested here. A popular version of ayahuasca in the USA and Europe contains DMT, a serotonergic psychedelic9. It is possible that DMT may have contributed to the antidepressant effects reported in clinical studies using ayahuasca11, 12. This contribution could be due to both brain plasticity mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation66 and to the profound psychological experiences induced by psychedelics67. While studying DMT in the neurogenesis model was not an objective of the present investigation, it could be assessed in a future study, comparing it with other 5-HT2A agonists such as psilocybin or LSD. Although several animal studies have already shown that harmine improves behavioral measures of depression17, 18, future studies could ideally test the four compounds assessed here for both in vivo neurogenesis and behavioral improvement. Finally, future research could also use positive controls to compare the potency of the B. caapi β-carbolines with that of other antidepressants, such as SSRIs and MAO inhibitors In conclusion, here we showed that the β-carboline alkaloids present in B. caapi, the plant source of the ayahuasca tea, promote neurogenesis in vitro by stimulating neural progenitor pool expansion, and by inducing cellular migration and differentiation into a neuronal phenotype. The stimulation of neurogenic niches in the adult brain may substantially contribute to the antidepressant effects reported for ayahuasca in recent clinical studies. The versatility and full neurogenic capacity of the B. caapi β-carbolines warrant further investigation of these compounds. Their ability to modulate brain plasticity indicates their therapeutic potential for a broad range of psychiatric and neurologic disorders",
37,10.1038/s41386-019-0324-9,"We here show that psilocybin ingestion of between 3 and 30 mg is associated with dose-dependent occupancy of cerebral 5-HT2ARs. Further, plasma psilocin concentration and 5-HT2AR occupancy are positively associated and the relationship conforms with a single-site binding model. Lastly, subjective intensity ratings are positively correlated with both neocortical 5-HT2AR occupancy and plasma psilocin levels, strongly supporting that stimulation of cerebral 5-HT2ARs is paramount for the psychedelic effects of psilocybin Similar to previous 5-HT2AR PET-imaging occupancy studies with other 5-HT2AR drugs [31, 32], we found that the single-site binding model provided a good fit of the relation between drug blood levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy, and predicted maximum occupancies were similar. Here, it is important to emphasize that the occupancies detected with an agonist radioligand (such as [11C]Cimbi-36) may differ from that of antagonist radioligands because an agonist radioligand may bind preferentially to receptors in the high-affinity state [33, 34]. Thus, given that high-affinity receptors are believed to be most important for neurotransmission, an agonist radioligand may yield a more relevant estimate of receptor levels We found the EC50 of psilocin to be 1.95 μg/L. This corresponds to 10 nM, which is in the same range of Ki values from in vitro studies (rat cortex) performed with another 5-HT2AR agonist, [125I]DOI: 6 nM [35] or 25 nM [36] The post hoc linear regressions showed positive associations between mean PET 1 intensity ratings and MEQ30, global 11-D ASC score, and EDI score, and intensity ratings correlated also with both occupancy and with psilocin levels (Fig. 4). Thus, although the participants scored their overall intensity of the psychedelic experience based on a number of different components (e.g., imagery, changes in perception, stimulation of mood, feeling of enhanced meaning, somatic sensations, etc.), and probably also as a function of previous drug experience and psychological make-up (“set”), including personal coping style, our results show that intensity ratings constitute a meaningful global measure of psychedelic experience that is feasible to obtain with high temporal resolution Previous studies in humans reported that antagonists at 5-HT2A and 2C receptors can prevent perceptual effects after subsequent ingestion of psilocybin [9, 10]. Our data show that psilocin plasma levels correlate with occupancy (Fig. 3), that psilocin levels and occupancy correlate with intensity (Fig. 4), and that intensity correlates with scores of MEQ30, 11D-ASC and EDI. Thus, our findings strongly support that 5-HT2AR stimulation is central for psychedelic experiences in humans, and adding our findings to the existing literature, the evidence is by now strong that the 5-HT2AR is indeed the critical molecular mediator of psychedelic effects of psilocybin Our model can in future studies assist to estimate psilocin brain 5-HT2AR receptor occupancy without the use of PET-imaging, by determining plasma psilocin levels. For example, Brown and colleagues recently reported that ingestion of 25 mg psilocybin results in a mean Cmax of about 15 ng/mL [37]. Assuming analysis methods of similar quality, similar stability of psilocin samples and a plasma density of 1.02 g/mL [38], this plasma psilocin level corresponds to 69% occupancy. There is considerable inter-individual variability in psilocybin pharmacokinetics [37, 39, 40]. Consistent with this, Cmax for Subject 3 (12 mg, 0.14 mg/kg) was higher than Cmax values for Subjects 4, 5, and 6 (15, 18, and 24 mg, respectively; 0.2, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg). Importantly, our data convincingly demonstrate that plasma psilocin levels correlate closely with the overall psychedelic experience, and it is possible that future clinical trials may benefit from relating psilocin levels and/or estimated occupancies to clinical effects, rather than absolute doses Recently, it has been argued that psychedelic “microdosing”, entailing a dose small enough to avoid noticeable perceptual effects [41], comes with benefits such as enhanced creativity, social interaction and mood. Although a dose range of 0.5–2 mg psilocybin has been suggested as a psilocybin microdose (Dr. James Fadiman, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, personal communication), there are currently no data available to identify such a cut-off. Subject 1 received 3 mg (0.05 mg/kg), had noticeable perceptual effects and an occupancy of 43%. This indicates that a smaller dose/lower occupancy would be needed for microdosing studies. Based on our data, a dose range of 0.5–2 mg is a reasonable suggestion for potential psilocybin microdose studies A few limitations of the study should be noted. When fitted to a single-site binding model without constraining Occmax = 100%, we found Occmax = 77%. Possible explanations for this include violations of kinetic modeling assumptions [13, 42], rapid internalization of 5-HT2AR or psilocybin-associated lowering of brain 5-HT levels. Although weaker than for 5-HT2AR, psilocin has also affinity to 5-HT 2B, 5-HT 2C, and 5-HT 1A receptors [36, 43]; the affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) is about 100 times lower [43]. A net decrease in cerebral 5-HT levels due to psilocin agonist activity at 5-HT1A autoreceptors could lead to an underestimation of occupancy due to decreased competition at 5-HT2ARs during intervention scans [44]. In vitro studies reported that 5-HT2AR stimulation led to 5-HT2AR internalization [45,46,47,48]. We cannot exclude that [11C]- Cimbi-36, being an agonist radioligand, has different affinity to internalized 5-HT2AR, leading to an underestimation of occupancy. We did not observe a difference between EC50 values of PET 1 and 2, suggesting that if internalization occurred, it occurred either very rapidly (within a few minutes) or very slowly (days after). For Subject 1 who received only 3 mg, occupancy was 43% at PET 1 and 2% at PET 2, speaking against 5-HT2AR internalization. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to investigate long-term effects of a single psilocybin dose on cerebral 5-HT2AR levels, as a potential molecular mediator of the long-term effects on personality and mood [3,4,5, 49]. Such a study is currently ongoing in our lab We did not observe statistically significant median head motion during PET 1 or PET 2 compared to baseline scans (Supplementary Methods and Materials). Participants 7 and 8 exhibited maximum motion of up to 35 and 20 mm during PET 1, respectively. Although this could affect the kinetic modeling, model fits were acceptable and comparable to baseline scans. Our conclusions are based on only eight participants, but five were investigated three times which generated two occupancy measures for each of these participants. The majority of male participants, that participants were recruited as specifically interested in a neuroimaging study investigating psilocybin, and the narrow age range decreases generalizability of our findings to the extent there are sex-dependent or age-dependent differences in psilocybin [50] or radioligand kinetics and differences in psilocin levels, occupancy or intensity ratings as a function of propensity to seek study participation in a psychedelics research study. PET-environment was positively correlated with anxiety during a psilocybin intervention [51] and we cannot exclude that the PET-environment influenced the psychedelic experience [29], making experiences less comparable to therapeutic or naturalistic settings. Yet, our participants experienced anxiety only to a very limited extent (11-D ASC anxiety subscale (median [range]: 4.25 [0; 17.3]). The study was not placebo-controlled and it is possible that this may have ultimately affected intensity ratings. Also, we cannot rule out that metabolites of psilocin or expectation-induced changes in 5-HT levels could affect the occupancy estimates, although we are unaware of evidence suggesting this In summary, we find that in humans, psychedelic effects of psilocybin are closely correlated with psilocin stimulation of the 5-HT2AR, and our data allows for an objective assessment of psilocybin effects on 5-HT2AR in future studies, by measuring plasma psilocin levels",
38,10.1590/1516-4446-2015-1701,"In this systematic review, we identified 21 studies on the anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids that met our inclusion criteria. Despite the small number of studies and the high degree of heterogeneity among them, the reported results consistently show that these compounds have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties. These findings will be discussed in detail below Research performed among ayahuasca consumers over the last 20 years shows that users of this substance do not exhibit symptoms of psychiatric disorders or neurocognitive problems, but instead show normal or better cognitive function, increased well-being and spirituality, and reduced psychopathology, including anxiety and depression symptoms.10-12,14,15,34-36 Moreover, DMT administration to healthy volunteers suggest that this tryptamine may have anxiolytic properties Studies in rodents have reported that the β-carbolines harmine and harmaline, as well as ayahuasca, produce anxiolytic or antidepressive effects. As harmaline acts as a MAO-A inhibitor,3,5 the anxiolytic effects of this compound22,23 could be theoretically explained by an enhancement of serotonin concentrations in the brain after MAO-A inhibition.37 Nevertheless, the mechanisms of action responsible for the anxiolytic and antidepressive properties of harmine and harmaline are not completely understood, and other non-serotonergic mechanisms could also be involved Specifically, the antidepressive effects of harmine are apparently independent of its effects as a MAO-A inhibitor,3,5 and seem to be mediated by regulation of cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress,28-30 and modulation of BDNF, an endogenous protein involved in neuroplasticity and depressive symptoms.25-27 Harmine and harmaline also bind to 5-HT2A receptors.38-40 Since hallucinogens increase cortical glutamate levels following activation of 5-HT2A receptors, increasing the expression of BDNF in prefrontal areas,41 42-43 the agonist action of harmine and harmaline in this serotonergic receptor could also lead to increased BDNF levels A study suggested that the GABAA receptor could be involved in the antidepressive effects of harmine.24 Nevertheless, some studies suggest that harmine, harmaline, and THH display little affinity for benzodiazepine receptors Regarding DMT, there is evidence that 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists modulate emotional processing, reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increase positive mood. Interestingly, cortical expression of 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor is altered in post-mortem samples of depressed patients.43 Therapeutic drugs that are 5-HT1A receptor agonists produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects in animals and humans,37,43,44 and 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects in animals.45 46-47 Moreover, there is increasing evidence that anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with inflammatory processes, and 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists have anti-inflammatory properties Other 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor agonists, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also produce reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and increases in positive mood. In the mid-1950s and 1960s, several studies investigated the potential therapeutic use of psilocybin and LSD in the treatment of disorders such as neurosis and OCDs, and as an adjunctive therapy in the terminally ill.42,51 52 53 54 55-56 However, a definite conclusion regarding the potential beneficial effects of these compounds cannot be drawn from previous investigations, since many of these studies had important methodological limitations, such as lack of a control group or randomization, absence of double-blind/placebo-controlled designs, and limited follow-up data Recent studies reported that psilocybin produces anxiolytic effects in mice in the marble burying test, an animal model of OCD,57 and that LSD produced antidepressive-like effects and normalized learning behavior and hippocampal serotonin 5-HT2 signaling in a rat model of depression (olfactory bulbectomy) As previously reported, smoked DMT increased positive mood in healthy voluntters,6 and both psilocybin59 60 61 62-63 and LSD64 also increased positive mood in experimental studies in humans. Case reports56,65 66 67-68 and clinical trials69 suggest that psilocybin and LSD may be beneficial for patients with OCD. Moreover, psilocybin- and LSD-assisted psychotherapy has been shown to reduce anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in patients with anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases such as advanced-stage cancer The antidepressive properties of ayahuasca could also be related to alterations of cortical connectivity in the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain areas involved in introspection, meditative states, daydreaming, imagination, and mind-wandering. Depressive states are associated with increased rumination, a self-referential process that may become difficult to disengage and is associated with increased activity of the DMN, and acute ayahuasca administration (2.2 mL/kg of body weight) significantly reduced DMN activation.73 A recent study evaluated cortical thickness in 22 regular users of ayahuasca (average 5.3 years of continuous use; range: 2-13 years) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reported significant cortical thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key node of the DMN Regarding other serotonergic hallucinogens, a recent functional MRI (fMRI) study involving intravenous administration of psilocybin (2 mg) to 15 healthy volunteers reported significant decreased cerebral blood flow in several brain areas including the PCC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), another important component of the DMN.75 A subsequent study reported increased functional connectivity of the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN), involved in goal-directed attentional tasks.76 Since the DMN and TPN have opposite functions, the authors suggested that the subjective effects of hallucinogens, as well as psychotic and meditative states, could be caused by disruption of DMN-TPN functional connectivity. This disruption would obfuscate the separateness of internally and externally focused states, profoundly altering cognition, perceptions, emotions, and consciousness. However, no significant change was observed in DMN-TPN connectivity after acute ayahuasca administration. Thus, further studies are needed to better explore the subjective and therapeutic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens Animal and human studies suggest that ayahuasca and its alkaloids can produce anxiolytic and antidepressive effects, which are probably mediated by agonist action on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors. These receptors are involved in emotional processing, regulation of BDNF brain levels, anti-inflammatory actions, and altered DMN functional connectivity. However, the mechanisms of action involved in these therapeutic effects are not completely understood, and, at least in the case of harmine, may include non-serotonergic mechanisms that regulate cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and oxidative stress Considering that the average time necessary for the onset of therapeutic action of commercially available antidepressants is 2 weeks,77 the fast antidepressant action of ayahuasca reported in our preliminary clinical trial is promising. Recently, our group increased the number of depressive patients receiving ayahuasca treatment and used single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess regional cerebral blood flow after drug administration. Our results suggest similar positive effects as described in our pilot study In summary, the results of this systematic review suggest that ayahuasca and its alkaloids have anxiolytic and antidepressive properties. These results are supported by studies using rodent models of anxiety and depressive disorders, experimental studies in healthy volunteers, observational studies in ayahuasca consumers, and preliminary data from depressed patients Investigation of these compounds could provide new pharmacological treatments with fast-acting beneficial effects for patients with anxiety and depressive disorders. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings Limitations of the present review include the small number of studies, especially clinical trials, and the heterogeneity among reviewed reports. Furthermore, most evidence showing anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or its alkaloids comes from rodent studies. Thus, it is premature to extrapolate these results to humans until more research is conducted With the exception of a single pilot study, the human studies included in this review were mostly experimental and observational in nature. The experimental studies described had small sample sizes and were not designed to assess anxiolytic or antidepressive effect. An important limitation of observational studies with long-term ayahuasca consumers is that it is generally very hard to differentiate whether the improvements described are a consequence of the ingestion of ayahuasca or of joining a religious group, which can improve quality of life and well-being.79 Experimental and observational studies provide weak evidence of causality, and until more clinical trials are developed, the available evidence in humans must be considered preliminary Despite these limitations, the results showing anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids are relatively constant, and have been reported in rodents, healthy volunteers, and depressed patients",
39,10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.024,"In this paper, we determined the agonist-activated structure of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor coupled to its canonical transducer Gαq, compared it with inactive state structures stabilized by both the partial agonist LSD and the inverse agonist methiothepin, and identified key determinants essential for agonist actions and receptor-Gq coupling. Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of classical psychedelics including LSD, psilocin, mescaline, and various N-BOH analogs, these studies provide structural insights into the actions of psychedelics at their molecular target. Importantly, we also discovered that the specific interactions the 5-HT2A receptor achieves with Gq residues are essential for the apparently selective engagement of this receptor with Gq-family proteins in vitro Some of these findings contrast with predictions from a recent study utilizing chimeric Gα subunits that indicated that HTR2A interact efficiently with all of the 11 tested Gα subunits, albeit with low efficacy at Gαs (Inoue et al., 2019). However, the Gα subtypes in that study (Inoue et al., 2019) were created by replacing the terminal seven amino acids of Gq with the corresponding sequences from several other Gα subunits using the motif LXXXLX (where X = subtype selective sequences) (Inoue et al., 2019). Pertinent to this, we note that immediately prior to L353 is Q352 that is conserved among all of the chimeric G proteins employed in the study by Inoue et al. (2019). Here, we discovered that the Q352 cognate residue directly interacts with HTR2A TM6 residue N3176.29, and mutation of this residue abolishes the ability of HTR2A to activate Gq. We also point out that in the only other Gq-GPCR structure available, the same Q352 interacts directly with the TM5 residue R5.46 (Maeda et al., 2019). Importantly, using assays in which full-length heterotrimeric G proteins were used, we find that HTR2A productively couples weakly with only one Gi-family member, Gαz Relevant to these findings, we also found important interactions outside the α5 helix that are essential for HTR2A-Gq interactions. Thus, R132ICL2 interacts via an extended backbone interaction with N32 of the α-helical domain, and we further demonstrated via mutagenesis and functional assays that this interaction is essential for agonist-induced activation of Gq. This GPCR-Gq interaction is not seen in the M1-G11 structure, although R134ICL2 in M1 could weakly interact with the backbone carbonyl of R32 in Gq based on an examination of that prior structure. These results underscore suggestions made decades ago that the selectivity determinants for Gα subunits may not be entirely specified by reside in their terminal 5–7 amino acids (Wess, 1997) We also discovered that a key hydrophobic residue essential for G protein coupling among various GPCRs—I181ICL2—when mutated, abolishes Gαq coupling while potentiating arrestin binding at HTR2A. This result was unexpected because there was no prior data with sufficiently high resolution of GPCR-arrestin complexes that could illuminate how the mutation of a single amino acid at the GPCR-Gα interface would switch the coupling of HTR2A from an unbiased to an arrestin-exclusive state. While this paper was in revision, however, a 3.3 Å resolution structure of the turkey β1-adrenergic receptor complexed with human β-arrestin1 was reported (Lee et al., 2020). A comparison of this structure with the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (Rasmussen et al., 2011) and our HTR2A-Gq structure reveals that the cognate hydrophobic residue F139ICL2 in β2-AR interacts with the Gs α5-helix in a manner similar to HTR2A-Gq. In the β1 adrenergic receptor-Arrestin structure, by contrast, F147ICL2 is displaced upward where it would potentially clash with residues in the α5 helix of Gs (Figure 7I) and where it is engaged in no productive interactions. A similar relative lack of extensive engagement of this cognate residue with arrestins can be seen in the lower resolution muscarinic- and neurotensin-receptor arrestin complexes (Huang et al., 2020; Staus et al., 2020) (Figure 7J) This analysis provides a potential structural explanation for how loss of this hydrophobic interaction impairs Gq subunit coupling while preserving arrestin interaction—at least for HTR2A In addition to these fundamental insights into GPCR-Gq interactions, our findings have relevance for neuropsychiatric drug discovery. Psilocybin and LSD have emerged as potential therapeutics for a number of neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and cluster headaches (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Bogenschutz, 2013; Gasser et al., 2015; Sewell et al., 2006; Nutt et al., 2020). Because the 5-HT2A receptor is essential for the actions of psilocybin in humans (Kometer et al., 2013; Nutt et al., 2020), insights into the molecular details of both HTR2A ligand recognition and HTR2A-effector coupling are key to arriving at a molecular understanding of hallucinogen actions. Additionally, these studies will provide a framework for a structure-guided search to identify more selective and efficacious HTR2A agonists as potential innovative neuropsychiatric therapeutics as recently exemplified by us for other GPCRs (Lyu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017; Stein et al., 2020)",
40,10.1371/journal.pone.0211023,"This was exploratory research that investigated people’s experience of and attitudes toward microdosing. Study One showed that, in the short term, microdosing led to an immediate boost across a range of psychological variables but that these effects were (mostly) not sustained over multiple days. Longer term, we found evidence that microdosing led to improved mental health, altered attentional capacities (reduced mind wandering and increased absorption), and increased neuroticism Study Two showed that amongst people who are interested in microdosing there are strongly held beliefs that microdosing can impact a wide range of psychological variables. A substantial majority of media reports on microdosing present the practice in glowing and positive terms. This may have led to a perception of microdosing as a general panacea that is able to improve virtually all aspects of an individual’s life. It is not clear the degree to which these expectations influence individuals’ interpretation and reports of their microdosing experiences Taken together these findings paint an intriguing picture. We found clear changes in a small set of psychological variables: decreased depression and stress; decreased mind wandering; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. Notably, these variables were not those that participants most expected to change. If the current findings were entirely due to expectation, then we should have seen changes in those variables that are most commonly discussed in media and online accounts of microdosing, and in those variables rated highest in Study Two. In fact several of the most commonly discussed effects of microdosing and the effects most expected to change (creativity, wellbeing, mindfulness) showed no evidence of alteration whatsoever. This suggests that the longer term changes we identified were unlikely to be due to expectation On the other hand, although we did identify clear short term changes following each microdose in the daily analyses, the longer term changes identified in Study One were unrelated to the total number of doses participants ingested during the study period and also unrelated to participants’ prior microdosing experiences. This surprising lack of a relationship between the overall quantity of microdoses and the degree of subjective effects is a reason to interpret these findings cautiously. At face value this suggests that any engagement with microdosing, whether a single dose or relatively frequent dosing, can impact the variables we identified. This may be the case, but it is also possible that participants’ self reports of dosage and frequency in this study were not precise enough to accurately characterise dose related effects Overall, these findings suggest several disconnects between the popular narrative around microdosing and the experience of microdosers in this sample. Participants in Study One microdosed less often than is recommended in most online protocols and did not report that many of the immediate effects of microdosing lasted beyond the day of dosing. Although popular accounts of microdosing describe sustained boosts in productivity and creativity [16–18], the longer term effects we identified mainly involved reduced mental distress and changes in constructs such as absorption and mind wandering that are not as commonly discussed. This suggests that microdosing may lead to more subtle changes characterised by improvements in mental stability, the capacity to sustain attention and increased ability to become engaged in intense imaginative experiences The most surprising finding was that neuroticism also appeared to increase following microdosing. This is not something that is discussed in popular accounts of microdosing and was not what participants expected in Study Two. This highlights an important and under discussed aspect of microdosing: not everyone has a positive experience. Although the majority of participants’ comments were positive (and even glowing), there were a subset of comments that reflected unease about microdosing (see Table 5). In a context of considerable hype around the practice of microdosing, particularly with regards to it’s potential as a business tool, it important to acknowledge that microdosing may not be universally beneficial. These findings highlight the need for further research into the full range of microdosing effects (positive and negative) and also for investigations into subtypes of individuals who may particularly benefit from or be adverse to the practice.",
41,10.1111/acps.12904,"In this open-label study of psilocybin therapy for treat-resistant major depression, clinical improvement among patients was found to be accompanied by significant changes in personality measures. Thus, from baseline to 3-month follow-up, the NEO-PI-R ‘Big Five’ score of Neuroticism significantly decreased, Extraversion and Openness scores significantly increased, Conscientiousness showed a trend-level increase, and no changes were seen in Agreeableness. A total of 11 of the 30 NEO_PI-R facets also significantly changed, with 10 of these surviving multiple comparisons correction. To our knowledge, this is the first time personality measures have been reported to change among patients undergoing psychedelic therapy for depression. These results expand on the findings of psilocybin-induced changes of personality traits in healthy volunteers 40 Overall, the detected pre- to post-treatment changes in both trait and facet scores in our trial corresponded well with observations from a study of patients who successfully underwent pharmacotherapy, mostly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for major depression 42. More specifically, the same four of ‘the Big Five’ traits changed in the two trials and in the same direction – that is toward the personality profile of healthy populations (although Conscientiousness only at trend-level in our study). Also several of the facet changes we saw here overlapped with those reported by Costa et al. 42. More specifically, patients in both trials displayed decreases on the Neuroticism facets of depression, vulnerability, self-consciousness, and anxiety. Increases in Extraversion included the facets of warmth and positive emotions. Increases in Conscientiousness included the facets of competence and self-discipline. Means and standard deviations of NEO-PI-R scores were not reported by Costa et al., hindering calculation of effect sizes for direct comparison with our findings (listed in Table 1) Pre- to post-treatment changes in Neuroticism, a known vulnerability marker for affective disorders 44, 45, and increases in Extraversion, a trait associated with general positive affect 46, have previously been found to be significantly correlated with SSRI/SNRI-induced reduction in depression severity 47. In accord with this, QIDS decreases in our study were associated with decreases in Neuroticism and increases in Extraversion, albeit at only trend-level significance. In contrast, increased Openness did not correlate with treatment response and neither was it different between responders and non-responders. This is consistent with the principle that Openness to Experience is orthogonal to anxiety or depression symptoms 46 – although there are also some findings to suggest there is a moderate relationship between Openness and psychological wellbeing 48, 49. Support for the change in Openness score potentially being an addition to, rather than a direct effect of, improved affective symptoms can be taken from a recent naturalistic survey among more than 200 individuals for whom symptomatology and personality measures were assessed online, of a psychedelic experience conducted by our team. Here, Openness changed equally for depressed and non-depressed, whereas changes in Neuroticism were only observed among depressed individuals (manuscript in prep, data not shown) In addition, an extensive meta-analysis of personality changes after therapeutic interventions revealed that trait Openness was the only one among the ‘Big Five’ traits that did not robustly change 50. For a more direct comparison of our NEO-PI-R domain changes to previous treatment studies in depression, we identified 5 patient samples from 3 different trials in major depression where NEO-PI-R changes were reported after treatment with antidepressant medication 47, 51, 52 – although, in one of these studies, only Neuroticism scores were reported 51. Across these trials, SSRIs (citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluoxetine) 47, 51, 52, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (bupropion) 51, 52, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (venlafaxine) 52, a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (moclobemide) 51, a non-selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (phenelzine) 52, and a norepinephrine reuptake blocker (desipramine) 47 were used in relevant clinical doses over 8–20 weeks to treat a total number of 469 patients suffering major depression. The pre- and post-treatment NEO-PI-R domain score data presented in these publications allowed for calculation of Cohen's d effect sizes Interestingly, changes in Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness scores were very similar to what was seen in our study (sample size-weighted average Cohen's d; −0.59, 0.04, and 0.18 respectively, vs. −0.57, −0.01, and 0.27 in our study). In contrast, Cohen's d effect sizes for Openness in our trial were more than 3 times larger (0.44 vs. an average of 0.13) and more than 2 times larger for Extraversion (0.72 vs. 0.32) than the average effect sizes from the comparison trials. Of note, the lack of full consistency regarding follow-up (ranging from 8 to 20 weeks) means that interpretations of direct Cohen's d comparisons across studies should be made cautiously From the present data, it is hard to infer that the NEO-PI-R changes, and in particular changes in Neuroticism and Extraversion, represent trait and not state changes. However, a 3-month enduring change might suggest that it might not just be a state artifact – a notion also supported by the long-lasting psilocybin-induced increases in Openness observed in healthy individuals Whereas the facet scores were not reported in these studies, none of the Openness facets were found to be significantly changed after successful antidepressant treatment in the study by Costa et al. 42. In contrast, the facets Openness to actions and to values significantly increased in our study. The facet Openness to Actions pertains to not being set in one's way, and instead, being ready to try and do new things. Openness to Values is about valuing permissiveness, open-mindedness, and tolerance. These two facets therefore reflect an active approach on the part of the individual to try new ways of doing things and consider other peoples’ values and/or worldviews. Thus, treatment-induced modification of Openness and its facets following psilocybin treatment might be an outcome separate and additional to the changes that have previously been seen with antidepressant treatment for example 50. Whether the pattern of change in personality measures, in particular with regard to Openness, is different between psychedelic therapy and conventional pharmacotherapy (e.g., with SSRIs) should be tested in the future. In our laboratory, we are currently setting up a treatment study in major depression where the effects of such treatment models can be compared directly Studies investigating the relationship between psychedelics and personality among non-depressed individuals are worth considering in this regard. Follow-up evaluations of work from the 1950–60s have suggested the possibility of long-lasting effects on personality, resulting from the use of psychedelics 53, 54, and this has since been confirmed in a series of modern, controlled studies. For example, a single high dose of psilocybin with psychological support was found to facilitate long-lasting increases in trait Openness in psychedelic-naïve healthy individuals 40. Similarly, administration of LSD in a brain imaging setting led to discrete increases in Openness scores in healthy volunteers assessed at 2 weeks after the LSD session 41 although this was not replicated in a recent LSD study with longer postsession follow-up time points (1 month and 12 months) 55. Recently, administration of the entactogen, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), in conjunction with psychotherapy has been shown to lead to increases in Openness, as well as decreases in Neuroticism, in patients being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder 56. Regular ceremonial use of the psychedelic brew, ayahuasca, was associated with higher Openness scores when compared with matched non-ayahuasca using controls 57 and self-reported lifetime recreational psychedelic use correlated positively with Openness scores in a large online survey 58, as well as in a separate brain imaging trial (D. Erritzoe, under review). Interestingly, in the latter trial, it was the Openness to Actions and Openness to Values subfactors that correlated with lifetime psychedelic use (D. Erritzoe, under review) It is well established that trait Openness correlates reliably with liberal political perspective 61-63, 58. Given that psychedelics have been found to modulate Openness and other work has shown that Openness and liberal political perspectives are related, it is reasonable to surmise that psychedelics may modulate political perspective also. Indeed, work in the past has found associations between psychedelic use and attitudes of ‘personal liberty’ and ‘foreign policy liberalism’ 53, as well as concern for others, irrespective of culture of origin 62. Moreover, a series of recent studies have further endorsed a general relationship between psychedelic use and greater pro-environmental behavior 63 and nature-relatedness 58, 63, 64, as well as liberal 60 and antiauthoritarian perspectives 58, 64. The apparent link between Openness and a generally liberal worldview may be attributed to the notion that people who are more open to new experiences are also less personally constrained by convention and that this freedom of attitude extends into every aspect of a person's life, including their political orientation It is worth noting that the Openness score among patients entering our trial was already slightly higher at baseline (2.7 T-score points higher, illustrated in Fig. 1) than the normative scores reported in the NEO-PI-R manual 66 and increased another 4.9 T-score points following the intervention. Openness therefore differed from the other three personality traits in that it changed from an already higher than average baseline to an even higher level 3 months later. In contrast, the other traits all changed in the direction of normative data (see Fig. 1), for example, Neuroticism decreased from an abnormally high level at baseline, whereas Conscientiousness (trend-level) and Extraversion both increased from an abnormally low baseline, and thus toward the values of healthy non-depressed individuals 66. The explanation for Openness being relatively high at baseline may be found in the nature of the trial; people who are less Open to Experience are probably less likely to volunteer for a novel treatment involving a psychedelic drug. In support of this interpretation, healthy volunteers who took part in an invasive PET brain imaging study specifically had significantly higher Openness scores when compared to Danish NEO-PI-R norm data 67 The observation that a single profound psychedelic experience can lead to lasting changes in personality is intriguing, especially when considering the relative stability of personality once adulthood is reached. Longitudinal studies have shown that personality changes after age 30 are typically subtle and/or gradual, that is around 1–2 T-score points per decade, with a subtle drop in Openness and Extraversion scores and a slight increase Agreeableness in older age 68. However, as longitudinal studies of personality are typically conducted with very long intervals between sampling of personality traits, the personality literature overall provides limited evidence for how fast or slow personality trait change can occur 50. Thus, our observation of relatively marked changes in personality within a short time span challenges the assumption that personality can only change slowly, gradually, and subtly. A systematic review of more than 200 studies concluded that enduring and large changes in personality are obtainable through a range of therapeutic interventions 50 but to our knowledge, none so rapidly or as marked as with psychedelics. The phenomenon of psychological ‘quantum change’ may be relevant in this regard 69, where one's outlook and behavior rapidly and profoundly changes – such as with sudden religious conversion experiences Of the acute experience factors that most related to personality change, greater insightfulness during the 25 mg experience was found to be correlated with decreased Neuroticism as well as increased Extraversion at 3 months. Also, greater spiritual experience was correlated with increased Extraversion. Borderline relationships were seen between increased Extraversion and higher blissful state and Experience of unity scores. The observation that the long-lasting impact of psychedelic therapy – in this case on measures of Extraversion and Neuroticism – may depend on their ability to occasion profound insights and ‘peak’ 29 or mystical-type 70 experiences is supported by a number of modern clinical trials, where the magnitude of such peak or mystical experience is often predictive of positive clinical outcome 16, 18, 20, 35, 37. Problems related to the potentially non-secular meaning of ‘mystical experience’ have recently been raised 24 but if the construct has predictive value, then it at least forces us to ask ‘why’? With the exception of spiritual Experience, blissful state, and unity predicting increased Extroversion, the major personality changes observed here were not strongly predicted by factors relevant to ‘mystical experience’. It is interesting that the somewhat more concrete notion of insightfulness showed more compelling relationships with the personality changes in the present study. Importantly, correlation analyses in this paper were not corrected for multiple comparisons and should therefore be considered exploratory in nature. In addition, it should here be noted that the sample size of the present study is modest, in particular when dividing it further into subgroups of responders and non-responders. This limits our statistical power to detect small effect sizes that may be of clinical importance, and future randomized and placebo-controlled trials with larger sample sizes will be important to further substantiate the findings from the present study These present findings are somewhat inconsistent with those of MacLean et al. who found that individuals who had a ‘mystical-type’ experience were more likely to show sustained increases in Openness several months later 40. This may be explained by differences in the study populations, differences in the questionnaires that were used to assess subjective psilocybin experience, attitudes, and philosophy of support provided by the research staff (e.g., relative emphasis on mystical experience during preparation), or by the time delay at which personality was assessed (i.e., 3 months in the present study and over 12 in the MacLean study) The neurobiological correlates of personality change after psychedelics have yet to be investigated. However, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has revealed that brain serotonin 2A receptor levels, the key initiator of psychedelics’ signature psychological and neurophysiological effects 71 are positively associated with Neuroticism scores 67. In fact, the same Neuroticism facet scores that were found to decrease the most after psilocybin therapy in the present study (vulnerability anxiety, depression, and self-consciousness) were also the facets most strongly correlated with serotonin 2A receptor binding in a sample of 83 healthy volunteers 67. Also, the trait ‘dysfunctional attitude’, which is associated with pessimistic beliefs, has been associated with elevated serotonin 2A receptor levels in both depressed patients 72 and individuals recovered from depression 73. It has been suggested that serotonin 2A receptor upregulation is secondary to deficient stimulation with serotonin 72, which is consistent with the observation that downregulation of 2A receptors is associated with treatment with antidepressant drugs that elevate synaptic serotonin (Muguruza et al., 2014) To our knowledge, although Openness has not been directly associated with serotonin 2A receptor regulation, and 2A receptor levels did not appear to mediate an association between lifetime recreational use of psychedelics and elevated Openness scores (D. Erritzoe, J. Smith, P. M. Fisher, R. Carhart-Harris, V. G. Frokjaer, G. M. Knudsen, under review), it is possible that serotonin 2A receptor function is linked to Openness. Evidence from rodents suggests that cognitive flexibility is in part mediated via the 2A receptor 74, and, as discussed previously, a variety of 2A receptor agonists, such as psilocybin, DMT, and LSD, are associated with increased Openness, as well as increased cognitive flexibility and creative thinking 75-79. Indeed, serotonin and more specifically, serotonin 2A receptor stimulation has been associated with a relaxing of prior assumptions 80 – which would fit with the qualities of open-mindedness that characterize the Openness dimension. More investigations into the role of serotonin 2A receptors in mediating changes in Openness are therefore clearly warranted In summary, our study detected changes in personality measures from baseline to 3 months post psilocybin therapy in patients suffering major depression. Decreases in Neuroticism and (trend-level) increases in Conscientiousness were consistent with what has been found previously among patients responding to antidepressant treatment, whereas pronounced increases in Extraversion and, in particular, in Openness, might constitute an effect more specific to therapy with a psychedelic than with other antidepressant interventions. This hypothesis needs to be explored further in future controlled studies, however, as do the brain mechanisms of postpsychedelic personality change. Finally, some preliminary evidence was found that certain changes in personality were predicted by the nature of the acute experience under psilocybin, with acute Insight being particularly implicated.",
42,10.1093/ijnp/pyx036,"Here we investigated the neural correlates of the psychedelic “after-glow” induced by ayahuasca in healthy volunteers. Using 2 different MRI techniques, we evidenced significant neurometabolic and functional connectivity changes hours after the acute effects of ayahuasca had disappeared. These modifications were associated with immediate changes in the psychological sphere that were marginally maintained 2 months later. Our results replicate previous findings of enhanced mindfulness capacities, including increased “decentering,” and decreased judgmental and reactive attitudes during the post-acute phase of ayahuasca (Soler et al., 2016). Ayahuasca had the power to increase FFMQ, EQ, and Mindsens scores in individuals with already high baseline scores (Soler et al., 2014a). We also found increases in self-compassion, a previously unexplored facet in this context MRS showed neurometabolic changes in the PCC, a region rich in 5-HT2A receptors (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Beliveau et al., 2016) and a target region of psychedelics (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Valle et al., 2016). Glx levels in the PCC were lower in the post-acute assessment compared with baseline values, an effect that was however only marginally significant when corrected for multiple comparisons. We thus obtained partial evidence for the previously postulated involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the effects of psychedelics (Kłodzinska et al., 2002; Moreno et al., 2011) While we did not measure Glx levels during the acute psychedelic phase, our MRS findings are compatible with increased glutamate levels during the acute stage. Cortical glutamate levels increase in periods of external perceptual stimulation or during active cognitive tasks, while they fall below baseline levels during stimulation- or task-free periods (Mangia et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2015; Terhune et al., 2015). Also, acute psilocybin decreases brain aspartate (Preller et al., 2016), a neurotransmitter whose levels vary in an anticorrelated fashion with those of glutamate (Mangia et al., 2007). The post-acute Glx decreases in the PCC may result from increased excitatory activity during the acute phase. EEG and MEG studies in humans have shown a decrease of alpha oscillations, an inhibitory rhythm, in the parieto-occipital cortex during the acute effects of psychedelics (Kometer et al., 2013; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Valle et al., 2016) The post-acute Glx reductions in the PCC are also consistent with the observed reductions in Cr, NAA, and NAAG. Cr and N-acetyl compounds have been associated with metabolic activity, and NAAG has been directly linked to glutamatergic pathways (Rae, 2014). Additionally, the inverse correlation found between Cr and NAA-NAAG variations and scores on the HRS-Cognition subscale suggest a relationship between the intensity of acute effects and subsequent neurometabolic reductions. Neurometabolic changes may have contributed to the antidepressant effects reported for ayahuasca (Osório et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016). Depressed patients show abnormally high glutamate levels in the parieto-occipital cortex (Bhagwagar et al., 2007). Glutamate reductions in these areas correlate with clinical improvement in depression (Abdallah et al., 2014) The functional connectivity analysis also evidenced post-acute changes. Activity in the PCC and associated areas within the DMN (Raichle et al., 2001) has been associated with the personal sense of “self.” Psychedelics acutely loosen the boundaries of the “self” and increase the cross-talk between networks (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2016a). Here, we found a post-acute increase in coupling between the PCC and a subregion of the ACC pertaining to the TPNs While DMN and TPN activity are typically anticorrelated (Fox et al., 2005), psilocybin and LSD acutely increase DMN-TPN connectivity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013), and general inter-network connectivity (Roseman et al., 2014; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Our results suggest that cross-talk lingers beyond the acute stage and contributes to the “after-glow,” reflected as enhanced mindfulness capacities. Increased DMN-TPN connectivity correlated with reduced judgmental processing, inner reactivity, and increased self-kindness, providing a neurobiological basis for these modifications. Conventional mindfulness training also increases DMN-TPN connectivity (Doll et al., 2015) Visual areas showed increased coupling with the PCC but reduced with the ACC. This pattern suggests a greater interplay between internally generated visual information and spontaneous mind-wandering, and a reduction in cognitive control. These effects could explain increased phosphenes or “entoptic activity” persisting days after ayahuasca use (Frecska et al., 2012). A previous neuroimaging study found increased activity in the visual cortex under ayahuasca (de Araujo et al., 2012) The superior rostral ACC (srACC) seed also demonstrated increased functional coupling with parahippocampal, hippocampal, and amygdalar areas of the MTL. Prior studies had identified these areas as targets of acute ayahuasca (Riba et al., 2004, 2006; de Araujo et al., 2012). LSD acutely decreases fear recognition (Dolder et al., 2016), an effect mediated by the amygdala, and psilocybin increases synchronization between the hippocampus and the ACC (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014) Our data suggest that during the “after-glow” there is an enhanced interplay between the ACC, participating in executive tasks and in the binding of cognitive and emotional information, with limbic structures with key roles in emotion and memory processes. This finding is particularly relevant in the interpretation of the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca. Other researchers have found abnormal interactions between the srACC and the amygdala in depressed patients, possibly indicating decreased cognitive control over negative emotions (Fales et al., 2008) Our data show for the first time that the modification induced by psychedelics on brain dynamics leads to changes in its neurometabolic, functional, and psychological balance beyond the acute stage. As previously reported (Griffiths et al., 2011; Lebedev et al., 2016), the post-acute phase in our study showed positive psychological effects, highlighting the paradoxical nature of psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c). While the acute inebriation shares features with psychosis (Schmid et al., 2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c), psychedelics may lead to mid-term increases in psychological well-being. Increasing mindfulness capacities is clearly a desirable effect, especially in a psychotherapeutic context. Here post-acute scores were above values reported for meditators (Soler et al., 2014a), a population that also shows a pattern of decreased DMN-TPN anticorrelation (Brewer et al., 2011; Froeliger et al., 2012). Considering that maladaptive ruminations in depression have been associated with greater DMN “dominance” over TPN activity (Hamilton et al., 2011), our results provide another interesting link between psychedelic-induced neural modifications and the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca The post-acute phase of the psychedelic experience had received little attention from modern neuroscience. Although investigators had postulated the capacity of psychedelics to modulate brain plasticity (Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010), most research had assessed mid- and long-term effects only from a psychological perspective. The changes in personality and life attitudes reported in the 1960s (Savage et al., 1966; Pahnke, 1969) have recently been replicated as increases in trait openness (Griffiths et al., 2006; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016c). Also, in a structural neuroimaging study of regular ayahuasca users, we found a cortical thinning of the PCC, the area showing neurometabolic decreases in the present study. PCC thinning was inversely correlated with increased self-transcendence, a personality trait closely related to openness (Bouso et al., 2015) Our MRS and connectivity data provide a biological basis for the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca (Osório et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016). Its potential to influence brain dynamics at multiple levels suggests its usefulness to treat disorders that are highly refractory to therapeutic intervention. Its combined effect on the psychological and neural spheres may be particularly well suited to treat addiction disorders (Fernández and Fábregas, 2014), where high impulsivity and self-centeredness coexist with alterations in brain function and structure (Vaquero et al., 2016) Our study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. We assessed a small sample of individuals before and after ayahuasca intake, with no control for placebo or time effects. The difficulties associated with Glx quantification allowed measurement in an even smaller sample. All participants had previous experience with ayahuasca, which may have biased our sample to individuals who usually experience positive effects after intake. Additionally, participants showed high baseline scores on several mindfulness facets. While this could be considered a limitation, it is also true that these capacities show “ceiling” effects and are difficult to increase in high scorers (Montero-Marin et al., 2016). The correlation analysis should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. Finally, our study investigated only the sub-acute stage of ayahuasca effects. The observed connectivity modifications cannot be interpreted as indicating persistent network changes. Future studies should consider using larger samples and double-blind, placebo-controlled designs. Also, the role of prior exposure to ayahuasca could be better established by recruiting less experienced or even ayahuasca-naive individuals To conclude, the present results indicate that ayahuasca and potentially other psychedelics induce neural modifications beyond the time frame of the acute inebriation. Neurometabolic decreases in the PCC and the increased inter-network connectivity were associated with enhanced mindfulness facets. These associations provide hints to a potential biological basis for the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca",
43,10.1007/s00213-017-4820-5,"Via an analysis of patient interviews, this study identified a number of ways in which music influenced the subjective experiences of patients receiving psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression. The most frequently reported themes relate to an intensification of emotions and mental imagery by music under psilocybin, complementing previous studies that demonstrated modulatory effects of LSD on music-evoked emotion (Kaelen et al. 2015, 2017) and music-evoked mental imagery (Kaelen et al. 2016) in healthy volunteers. By focussing on the phenomenology of the acute experience, the present study provided new insights into the role and importance of music in the context of psychedelic therapy. For example, the music appeared to be a significant source of guidance, creating a sense of grounding, as well as a sense of carrying the listener into different psychological places. Specific examples of this can be found in the following two excerpts The sad songs would bring painful memories on, more happy songs would make me think of a really good period in my life. Every new song could bring a different image I feel the music in large part drove a lot of the experience. Under the influence of psilocybin, the music absolutely takes over. Normally when I hear a piece of sad music, or happy music I respond through choice… but under psilocybin I felt almost that I had no choice but to go with the music. […] I did feel I was being held. And it did feel like the music opened [me] up to grief, and I just was very happy for that to happen. It wasn’t particularly pleasant in any way, but extraordinarily powerful. It took my thinking and my experience to uncomfortable places, but I was kind of reassured in the experience. There was something there that meant “I’m going to take you on a ride here, but I promise I won’t abandon you. It’s just going to be tough, and you know, you’re going through the grinder here, but you won’t be left in pieces.” That seemed to be… what the music was saying to me In contrast to the sense of guidance by the music were descriptions of the music providing a sense of misguidance. In these situations, the music was most often described as being dissonant with the patient’s emotions and thoughts. One example of the experience of misguidance and dissonance can be found in the following excerpt The light music at one point took me to a place where I thought I was safe, and it became unsafe, and the music was playing a trick with me, you know, sort of giving me a false sense of security. I can remember thinking “this is beautiful music, why am I going to this dark place?” It didn’t line up with what had gone on before. I just felt as I was being manipulated, being duped almost. The music lured me to this beautiful place, and then things started to become dark even with this beautiful music still playing One important observation is that effects of the music that were welcomed, included emotions such as increased grieving or tearfulness, and that an attitude of openness towards negative music-evoked emotions was frequently described as helpful in bringing to expression inner psychological conflicts that might then be resolved These experiences were grouped under the theme “openness to challenging experience feels therapeutic” and show similarities with recent qualitative research showing perceived therapeutic meaning in transient psychological struggle during psychedelic therapy (Belser et al. 2017; Swift et al. 2017). One example of this attitude of openness towards the music can be found in the following excerpt I can even view the negative moments as positive in a way because they served a purpose. The purpose was to sort of let me face the darkness, and my demons, I guess. It was beautiful at times, but also… yeah, the darker moments really helped to reflect on and connect with your unresolved shadows Contrasting such an attitude of openness to challenging experience is an attitude of resistance to the intensification effects of the music. This experience was characterised by not wanting the music or its effects and was named “resistance to intensification.” An example of this can be found in the following excerpt I worried that I let [the music] shape this sort of melancholy. There was resistance, massively, to everything, every sort of sensory input, I had a fearful response. I was afraid to open my eyes, I was afraid to do anything, I was afraid that this sort of music was the last thing I’d ever hear The study also shed light on how different musical styles and the design of the music playlist were experienced. The choice of the music and the design of the music playlist were overall well-appreciated, with the most frequently appreciated musical genres being ethnic-, vocal-, and (neo-) classical music. Appreciation was also expressed for the design of the playlist, in particular for the calming (ambient) music, which was particularly present during the early (pre-onset and early ascent) and the final (return) phases, and at periods during peak, while more emotionally evocative music being reserved for the peak phase. This indirectly supports the therapists’ views that that an optimal playlist design is characterised by a music genre selection that is structured to match the different phases of drug experience Strong disliking of the music selection was rare, but when this did occur it proved insightful about the possible functions of music selection: Typically, disliking of the music seemed to be associated with either a “diminishment” of psilocybin’s subjective effects, accompanied by unpleasant feelings (such as discomfort and irritation), and with an attitude of resistance, characterised by an attempt to psychologically reject and distance oneself from the music, such as detailed in the following excerpt The music blocked my experience and feelings. A sense of irritation, frustration, and sense of lowering mood. The majority of the songs were not my kind of music, I can’t sit with that music … I have to leave the room. I was sort of feeling bad, because I wanted to work with it. I sensed the potential for a really profound experience. I couldn’t meet that potential with music that I felt was quite mediocre. To me it didn’t feel real, so I felt quite torn As outlined above, notable polarities were observed in the music experience, such as the music being either liked or disliked, the music being either resonant or dissonant with the patient’s experience, and the patient being either open or resistant to the influence of the music. These variables (liking, resonance, and openness) positively predicted the extent to which patients reported having mystical experiences (a factor defined as the experience of unity, blissful emotionality, and spirituality). In addition, resonance and openness, but not liking, predicted the extent to which people reported insightfulness (a factor defined by having inventive ideas, feelings of profoundness, insights, and the experience of vivid personal memories or mental images). Drug intensity, on the other hand, also correlated with other aspects of the psilocybinexperience, such as impaired cognition and audio-visual perception changes. It must be noted that liking, resonance, and openness were highly correlated and thus likely represent one construct. The absence of a significant correlation between music liking and reported insightfulness may therefore be due to a lack of statistical power The selective association of the music experience with mystical experience and insightfulness, and not with other subjective experiences, supports the original motivations to include music in psychedelictherapy, i.e. to promote the occurrence of therapeutically meaningful experiences. Modern studies have confirmed that psilocybin can reliably facilitate mystical experiences (Griffiths et al. 2011, 2016), and these experiences have been associated with sustained positive changes in behaviour and personality (MacLean et al. 2011) and with positive therapy outcomes (Garcia-Romeu et al. 2014; Griffiths et al. 2016; Roseman et al. 2017; Ross et al. 2016). Although these studies incorporated music-listening in combination with psilocybin, this study is the first to demonstrate that the music experience during these sessions relates to the occurrence of mystical experiences. A positive relationship was also found between the music experience and reductions in depression 1 week after the psilocybin experience. Importantly, reductions in depression were not related to the intensity of the drug effects. This finding indicates that it is not merely the drug effect in isolation, but an interaction between the drug and the music on subjective experience that promotes positive therapeutic outcome A principal effect of psychedelics is that they temporarily dysregulate brain mechanisms that normally regulate emotion(Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2016b; Muthukumaraswamy et al. 2013; Tagliazucchi et al. 2016), and this could underlie the enhanced emotional responsiveness to emotionally evocative stimuli reported here as elsewhere (Carhart-Harris et al. 2012b; Kaelen et al. 2015, 2017; Quednow et al. 2012; Vollenweider et al. 2007). The notion that accepting and moving through challenging emotions are important for psychotherapeutic change is central to many psychotherapeutic models (Greenberg and Pascual-Leone 2006), has empirical support (Whelton 2004), and been noted by other psychedelic therapy studies (Belser et al. 2017; Swift et al. 2017; Watts et al. 2017). In psychedelic therapy, the function of psychedelics may be to ease the relinquishment of psychological control (i.e. ego dissolution and enhanced suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014)), thereby allowing a fuller and freer (i.e. less inhibited) expression of emotionality. The enhanced receptivity to music, in turn, may play the important function of activating emotionality, thoughts, and memories that are most personally salient. Thereby, music can guide the patient’s experience into directions that are most therapeutically significant. One key difference between psychedelic therapy and other forms of psychotherapy (and conventional pharmacotherapy) may be the capacity of psychedelics and music to rapidly facilitate deeply felt and personally meaningful emotionality It is worth considering that these findings show a remarkable congruency with the theoretical frameworks and patient experiences of “introspective” forms of music therapy, where music is utilised as the means to provide an experience that is thought to help the listener examine and change his/her relationship with themselves (Abbott 2005; Albornoz 2013; Summer 1992, 2011). This includes the use of music to evoke intense emotional experiences (Albornoz 2013), as well as a way to provide a “holding environment,”which feels “safe and secure” to express and experience new aspects of oneself (Carroll 2011; Schulberg 1999). Therapeutic effects of music are widely reported in literature and utilised across different health care disciplines (Finch and Moscovitch 2016; Mondanaro et al. 2017; Pavlov et al. 2017). The present findings therefore engender the view that psychedelic therapy utilises therapeutic effects of music that are enhanced via an interaction between the drug and the music Due to the prominence of music-listening in psychedelic therapy, increasing the knowledge of the appropriate therapeutic use of music in psychedelic therapy is important. This becomes particularly critical when psychedelic therapy is implemented on increasingly larger scales. The therapeutic influence of music has been referred to as being of “profound significance”(Bonny and Pahnke 1972), and several authors emphasised the care needed in selecting appropriate music, playing this music at the right circumstances, and within a personalised patient-centred format (Grof 1980; Hoffer 1965). The present study provides support for these views, by showing that when the music was experienced as dissonant with the unfolding experience, disliked, and rejected (resistance), therapeutic outcomes suffered. In contrast, when the music was in resonance with the patient’s experience, liked, and accepted (openness), therapeutic outcomes were most positive These music experience variables in this study (resonance, liking, and openness) correlated with each other, suggesting that they represent a single construct within the music experience that is associated with positive therapy outcomes. Liking of music is usually characterised as a mixture of genre appreciation and aesthetic judgements (Juslin 2013; Juslin and Västfjäll 2008; Juslin et al. 2016; North and Hargreaves 1997), and music liking may represent a basic pre-requisite for music to evoke personally meaningful emotionality. In addition, some music styles and acoustic properties may be more suitable for the conscious states induced by psychedelics than others. The patient’s attitude, in turn, appears to require a sufficient degree of openness to the music-evoked experience, and this may imply not only a state of surrender but also a pro-active and curious engagement with the therapeutic content that emerges This hypothetical framework holds that an optimal music experience (style liking, music’s resonance, and openness to music) creates an optimal climate for the expression of meaningful therapeutic content, characterised by the sensation of being on a personal journey, with a spontaneous and often intense emergence of personally meaningful imagery, thoughts, and emotionality. This optimal music experience construct may be a critical pre-requisite, and when it is not met adequately, is likely to result in the patient to distance from the music experience (resistance), characterised by feelings of discomfort, and a diminishment of personally meaningful imagery, thoughts, and emotionality (i.e. the absence of the sense of being on a journey). Given the patient’s experience is highly individual and dynamic, this finding suggests that the adaptation of the music during psychedelic therapy sessions may be critical at times, in order to provide adequate therapeutic support conditions, or prevent possible counter-therapeutic experiences: an idea that was often emphasised by early pioneers of psychedelic therapy (Bonny and Pahnke 1972; Grof 1980; Hoffer 1965) In this framework, the experience of resistance and dislike by the listener may be regarded as an important indicator for the therapist of music’s failure to act therapeutically, and the type of intervention needed to restore music’s therapeutic function may be determined by one central question the therapists may need to clarify, i.e. what is the source of the resistance or dislike? The therapists bear a responsibility to ensure the music styles are sufficiently liked, via thoughtful music selection, and that resonance is maximised by providing an attunement of the music to the patient’s personal and dynamically unfolding experience, via thoughtful playlistdesign and adaptation of the music when needed. However, in addition, it may occur that the music-evoked experience is rich with therapeutically meaningful content, yet the experience may be emotionally challenging, resulting in similar expressions of resistance. In these scenarios, the therapists may instead need to provide adequate therapeutic support for the patient to feel safe and motivated to engage in exploring and expressing the present challenging feeling states, of which the meanings may not always be immediately clear","In patients with treatment-resistant depression treated with psilocybin, music was described as having a substantial influence on their therapeutic experience, and selective correlations between the musicexperience and the occurrence of mystical experiences and insightfulness during sessions support this. Patients’ experience of the music, but not drug intensity, was predictive of reductions in depression 1 week later, suggesting that music plays a central mediating role in psychedelic therapy.These findings motivate greater appreciation of music as a key variable in psychedelic therapy and highlight the need for further research to better understand how music interacts with certain personality traits and psychological states to influence the acute experience and longer-term outcomes of psychedelic therapy"
44,10.1177/0269881116678781,"The CEQ was developed from responses to an internet survey of challenging experiences, and the stand-alone CEQ was validated in responses to a separate internet survey of challenging experiences. The seven factors of the CEQ display a simple factor structure, have high face validity, and represent a wide sampling of challenging aspects of psychedelic experience (referred to as “challenging experiences” for brevity) that aligns well with previous reports of presenting symptoms of acute adverse reactions to hallucinogenic substances (Cohen, 1960; Strassman, 1984; Ungerleider, Fisher, & Fuller, 1966; Ungerleider, Fisher, Fuller, & Caldwell, 1968). This includes affective (fear and grief)physiological (physical distress), and cognitive/affective (feelings of isolation, paranoia, feelings of insanity or loss of sanity, and the subjective experience of death) categories of subjective experience. Internal and external validity of the CEQ The factor structure of the CEQ was identified and confirmed in Study 1 within separate sub-samples of the data, and was shown to be invariant across levels of gender and struggle with psychiatric illnesses before the reported challenging experience. The factor structure of the stand-alone CEQ was validated in Study 2. While demographic variables did not differ in extreme ways between Study 1 and Study 2, they all differed significantly. Factorial invariance between Study 1 and Study 2 in spite of demographic differences provides evidence for internal validity of the CEQ and makes a case for the resilience of the CEQ factor structure. Participants provided ratings of the degree of difficulty of the challenging experience that they reported. Scores on the fear, grief, insanity, and death factors of the CEQ were consistently positively associated with these difficulty ratings in both Study 1 and Study 2, providing evidence for external validity of the CEQ. The experiences represented by the items in these four factors may constitute the core of what may be considered a challenging experience, while the remaining three factors may represent less reliable aspects of challenging experience. Differences in factor scores between samples in four scales (fear, physical distress, insanity, and paranoia) were observed (Table 7), and should be explored further in future studies. Greater fear and physical distress scores, and lower paranoia and insanity scores, were observed in Study 2 when compared to Study 1. These differences may be attributable to differences between Study 1 and Study 2 samples in demographics, but it is equally if not more compelling to consider that additional factors that were not controlled in these samples, such as psilocybin dose and details of set and setting, may be associated with differences in CEQ scores. An accepted clinical definition of “paranoia” is “unfounded fears that others intend harm to the individual” (Freeman et al., 2015). While one item of the paranoia scale of the CEQ is consistent with this definition (“feeling that people were plotting against you”), the other (“experience of antagonism toward people around you”), while likely related, is not closely consistent with this definition. Thus, the CEQ paranoia scale may be viewed as a crude measure of the clinical construct of “paranoia”, and the external validity of the paranoia scale may be somewhat restricted by this limitation Previous studies of the subjective effects of psilocybin have used ratings of the meaningfulness and spiritual significance of the experience to provide a very general characterization of the effects of psilocybin, in relation to other experiences that a volunteer has had (Griffiths et al., 2006; Griffiths et al., 2008; Griffiths et al., 2011). A consistent finding has been that moderate to high doses of psilocybin (20+ mg/70 kg) occasion experiences that are frequently rated in the top 5 most meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of a participant’s life. Participants have also attributed positive change in wellbeing to their psilocybin experience, and this change in well-being has been shown to correlate positively with mystical experience (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2015) and egodissolution (Nour et al., 2016). Preliminary research further suggests positive psilocybinoccasioned behavior change in the context of addiction treatment (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Garcia-Romeu, Griffiths, & Johnson, 2015; Johnson et al., 2014), providing a general characterization of the longer-term impact of these experiences. The associations between CEQ factor scores and the overall impact ratings of meaningfulness, spiritual significance, and change in well-being were assessed in the current samples. Scores on the insanity and death factors of the CEQ were positively associated with ratings of the meaningfulness of the reported experience in both Study 1 and Study 2. Scores on the fear factor were negatively associated with spiritual significance, while scores on the death factor were positively associated with spiritual significance of reported experiences in both studies. To the extent that individuals might construe or relate the loss of self-referential processing that is often reported during mystical experiences as feeling as though they are losing a sense of sanity or experiencing their own death, an encounter with this facet of challenging experience may be expected to covary with both the meaningfulness and the spiritual significance of an experience. The subjective experience of one’s own death and loss of control of the mind might somehow allow for the type of unity experience that leads to spiritual and meaningful experiences. However, scores on the death factor of the CEQ were negatively associated with change in well-being attributed to challenging experiences. While the experience of ego dissolution (Nour et al., 2016) and mystical experience (Barrett et a., 2015) are positively associated with well-being, it is not completely clear that the items of the ‘death’ subscale of the CEQ (“Profound experience of your own death” and “Feel as if dead or dying”) are collinear with either mystical experience or ego dissolution. The positive association between wellbeing and both mystical experience and ego-dissolution, contrasted against the negative association between wellbeing and the ‘death’ scale of the CEQ in both Study 1 and Study 2, suggests that there may be something unique about the subjective experience described as ‘death’ or ‘dying’ during a challenging experience that may detract from wellbeing, and this may have implications for therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics in clinical trials. Thus, future work may benefit from further elucidating the relationship between ego dissolution or mystical experience and the ‘death’ factor of the CEQ. Scores on the fear factor of the CEQ were associated with an increase in well-being attributed to challenging experiences and negatively predicted meaningfulness and spiritual significance of challenging experiences. Fear may generally detract from a spiritual experience, but the crucible of panic during a challenging experience might still lead to positive outcomes.","The Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) as validated in this report may serve as a valuable tool for characterizing psychologically difficult aspects of experiences occasioned by psilocybin and, very likely, by other classic hallucinogens. Better understanding of challenging experiences with classic hallucinogens may increase the precision of our understanding of both the psychological nature of and neural mechanisms underlying the effects of these drugs. Understanding challenging experiences with classic hallucinogens may also facilitate the optimization of therapeutic application of drugs within this class. Thus, the Challenging Experience Questionnaire developed in this report makes a significant contribution to methods of assessment of acute psychologically adverse reactions to psilocybin, and with further validation, will likely make a significant contribution to methods of assessment of such experiences with other classic hallucinogens"
45,10.1080/17512433.2018.1511424,"In the present systematic review, we analyzed 10 systematic reviews covering a wide variety of topics related to the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of classical or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics in the treatment of anxiety, mood, and substance-use disorders. Broadly, these topics basically included therapeutic effects and acute and long-term safety. Overall, these systematic reviews suggest that these substances have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive properties, and a good safety and tolerability profile However, included studies comprised a single meta-analysis of the effects of LSD on alcoholic patients [50], and several studies described in the reviews were observational studies of ritual ayahuasca use or open-label studies with ayahuasca, LSD, or psilocybin involving few volunteers [5,7,9,52–55]. Moreover, the number of RCTs in most reviews was small (1 to 10), with three reviews reporting a single RCT [7,50,51], with two of these trials being performed with a small number of healthy volunteers Furthermore, not all drugs showed the same level of evidence. For instance, the higher level of evidence was found for the antiaddictive effects of LSD in patients with alcohol dependence (with six RCTs) and for the anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of psilocybin in patients with advanced-stage cancer and nonmalignant life-threatening diseases (with three RCTs), while evidence for the antidepressive effects of LSD was found in only one RCT in patients with advanced-stage cancer and nonmalignant life-threatening diseases. However, studies with LSD and alcoholism were conducted from 1966 to 1970, while the psilocybin and LSD studies for existential anxiety and depression were performed from 2011 to 2016. This difference in time could induce bias regarding diagnosis criteria and the psychometric validity of the instruments used to measure the subjective/clinical outcomes in older LSD studies. Moreover, LSD studies had more heterogeneity regarding therapeutic techniques and drug doses. Therefore, although the literature on LSD was the only subjected to a meta-analysis and showed promising results, new RCTs are needed to replicate these findings In the case of psilocybin, the available evidence shows that this compound can be an effective treatment for patients with existential anxiety and depression. Indeed, a recent open-label study showed that a single dose of psilocybin induced rapid (1 week) and sustained (3 months) antidepressive and anxiolytic effects in 12 patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression [76]. The next steps would be to perform RCTs for depressed patients and to compare psilocybin with other antidepressive/anxiolytic drugs. Indeed, new RCTs covering these topics are being planned or are already being conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03181529, NCT03380442, NCT03429075) Moreover, future studies should also compare different therapeutic interventions associated with the administration of psilocybin and other serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics, since it still not known neither if the therapeutic effects of these drugs are increased by the inclusion of psychotherapy nor which psychotherapeutic approach would be the most effective. This is especially relevant in the case of ayahuasca, since in the open-label study with 17 patients with treatment-resistant MDD, no psychotherapeutic intervention was used before, during, or after the experimental sessions, and the results were significant, rapid (hours/days), and sustained (21 days), and were also evident in changes in blood perfusion (SPECT) [60,61]. Furthermore, these results were recently replicated in a RCT with 29 patients with treatment-resistant MDD in which no psychotherapeutic intervention was used (different from the open-label study, a predefined music playlist was used in this RCT): compared with placebo, single-dose ayahuasca administration was associated with rapid (24 h) and sustained (7 days) significant antidepressant effects [77]. Thus, future studies should investigate the role of different psychotherapeutic techniques and music in the therapeutic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics Among the different therapeutic effects, the lowest level of evidence of efficacy was found for the antiaddictive properties of ayahuasca and psilocybin, where only observational (ayahuasca) and open-label (psilocybin) studies were described. In the case of ayahuasca, one systematic review reported evidence from animal studies that this complex mix of substances and its isolated alkaloids have antiaddictive effects in studies using drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and alcohol [47]. However, this descriptive review was excluded from the preset text because it did not report any RCT. Thus, the next step would be to perform such trial in patients with substance-use disorders. In the case of psilocybin, new RCTs are being planned or are already being conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02037126, NCT02061293) Some observational studies of ritual ayahuasca use and experimental studies with psilocybin and LSD with healthy volunteers showed positive and significative changes in personality measures [9]. In observational studies, these changes often paralleled the reports of therapeutic effects. For example, ritual ayahuasca users reported reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and in the use of drugs such as alcohol, tobacco, and psychostimulants, and also described reduced impulsivity and novelty seeking and increased spirituality. The experimental data with LSD and psilocybin reported increases in openness, but the evidence is mixed and inconsistent [11,78,79]. Therefore, the next step would be the performance of new RCTs to try to replicate these results Regarding adverse effects, three descriptive systematic reviews focused specifically on the adverse effects associated with ayahuasca and its alkaloids [51–53], and all showed observational, experimental, or clinical evidence of good safety and tolerability when used in controlled settings (ritual, experimental, or clinical). In fact, observational studies of ritual use showed the first evidence of possible anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects of ayahuasca, which were subsequently observed both in animal models and in clinical trials [5,47,53–55]. A descriptive systematic review excluded from our analysis (because it did not report any RCT) reported three case series and two case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca intake and three case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with smoked DMT ([48]; also reported in [51]). Several reports described subjects with a personal and possibly a family history of psychotic disorders and/or concomitant use of other drugs. However, in experimental, open-label, and RCTs, the most common observed adverse reactions were transient and moderate increases in blood pressure and heart rate, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort and vomiting, and less commonly transient anxiety- and psychotic-like reactions [24,60,61]. We are not aware of any controlled study of ayahuasca (or LSD and psilocybin) with healthy volunteers or patients in which a prolonged psychotic reaction happened. Inclusion of a psychiatric screening to exclude individuals with a personal or family history of any psychotic illness or nonpsychotic mania seems to significantly reduce the possibility of such adverse reactions in controlled settings of hallucinogen/psychedelic research. However, patients with these characteristics are common in psychiatric clinics. Thus, this is an important limitation in the possible clinical use of hallucinogens/psychedelics Regarding adverse effects of LSD and psilocybin, most studies described in the systematic reviews reported data from controlled experimental and/or clinical settings, where these drugs showed a good safety and tolerability profile, with transient adverse effects such as anxiety- and psychotic-like reactions, transient, moderate increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, headaches, nausea, or vomiting [5,7,9,50,53,54,55,56; see also 37,80]. None of the studies reported cases of prolonged psychosis",
46,10.1007/s00213-018-4988-3,"The primary aim of the present study was to assess sub-acute and long-term impact of ayahuasca use on affect and cognitive thinking style. A total of 57 visitors of ayahuasca ceremonies in Colombia and the Netherlands consented to participate in this observational study and were asked to complete subjective questionnaires and a creative thinking task prior to an ayahuasca ceremony, the day after, and about 4 weeks later. Baseline and sub-acute assessments were conducted on-site whereas the 4-week follow-up was conducted online. The 4- week follow-up was completed by about 54% of the participants. Relative to baseline, ratings of depression and stress significantly decreased after the ayahuasca ceremony and these changes persisted for at least 4 weeks. Likewise, convergent thinking improved after the ayahuasca ceremony even at the 4-week follow-up. Satisfaction with life and several aspects of mindfulness increased the day after the ceremony, but these changes failed to reach significance 4 weeks after. Changes in affect, satisfaction with life, and mindfulness were significantly related to the level of ego dissolution experienced during the ayahuasca ceremony. Subjective ratings of stress and depression significantly decreased by 36 and 46% respectively during the day after the ayahuasca ceremony. Ratings of stress and depression remained significantly lower throughout the following month, suggesting that a single ayahuasca ceremony can bring about changes in affect that last for a prolonged period of time. Antidepressant properties of ayahuasca are not unexpected given that ayahuasca brews contain β-carboline alkaloids that act as MAO-A inhibitors which are known for their antidepressant actions (Finberg and Rabey 2016). Sub-acute reductions in depressive symptoms have been reported previously in first time (Barbosa et al. 2005) and regular ayahuasca users (Bouso et al. 2012). A pilot, open-label trial in six patients suffering from recurrent or major depressive disorder however showed significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after intake of a single ayahuasca dose (Osório et al. 2015). These data were recently replicated in a larger open-label trial that involved 17. depressed patients (Sanches et al. 2016). Together, these studies support the notion that single doses of ayahuasca can reduce symptomatology in depressed patients as well as in a broad spectrum of users who display non-pathological levels of depression and that such changes persist over a prolonged period of time. The mechanism underlying the long-term effects of ayahuasca on affect is presently unknown. Animal studies suggest that Banisteriopsis caapi preparations produce antidepressant activity through hippocampal neurogenesis (Farzin and Mansouri 2006; Fortunato et al. 2010). A recent study demonstrated that harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline, the three main alkaloids present in the Banisteriopsis caapi,stimulate adult neurogenesis in vitro using hippocampal progenitor cells from adult mice (Morales-Garcia et al. 2017). Neurogenesis has also been suggested to underlie the acute and long-term antidepressant properties of other psychedelic compounds such as ketamine (Duman and Aghajanian 2012; Ma et al. 2017) and psilocybin (Catlow et al. 2013; Idell et al. 2017). Neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity may play a crucial role in how neural circuits regulate their excitability and connectivity and may link the neurobiology of depression to the therapeutic effects of glutamatergic drugs such as ketamine (Abdallah et al. 2015). In that respect, it is of interest that changes in glutamate transmission following ayahuasca ceremonies have been associated to improvements in certain aspect of mindfulness as well (Sampedro et al. 2017). Ayahuasca also produced significant sub-acute improvements in subjective ratings of mindfulness and satisfaction with life. Subjects felt that they were more non-judgmental, acted with more awareness, and were more observant on the day following ayahuasca. Similar findings have been reported in an observational study that compared aspects of mindfulness before and 24 h after an ayahuasca ceremony using the same FFMQ questionnaire (Soler et al. 2016). In the present study, ratings of mindfulness and satisfaction with life increased by 5–8%, relative to baseline. On average, similar increments in mindfulness were obtained at 4 weeks after the ayahuasca ceremony, but this time, these no longer achieved statistical significance. It should be noted that ayahuasca-induced changes in mindfulness were much smaller than changes in symptoms of depression and stress. Consequently, the loss of statistical power caused by the drop in the response rate at the 4-week follow-up may have affected the probability of detecting changes as assessed with the FFMQ and SWL more than those assessed with the DASS, because changes in the former were small. Exposure to the ayahuasca ceremony also increased convergent thinking as assessed with the picture concept task. The number of correctly detected associations increased with 9% sub-acutely and with 29% at the 4-week follow-up. At the latter time point, the increase in cognitive performance also reached statistical significance. The PCT task has previously been used in an observational ayahuasca study to show that the brew increases performance at the divergent, creative thinking assignment but decreases performance in convergent thinking assignments (Kuypers et al. 2016). Data from these studies however are not necessarily conflicting. In the latter study, PCT performance was assessed during the acute phase of the ayahuasca experience (i.e., 2 h after intake), whereas in the present study, PCT performance was assessed sub-acutely and a month after the ceremony. It is conceivable that divergent, flexible thinking will improve during the acute psychedelic, modified state of consciousness that ayahuasca produces but not thereafter. Convergent thinking may not prosper during a psychedelic experience but may improve afterwards because it relies on mindfulness capabilities such as acting with awareness that contribute to optimization of cognitive functioning (Lebudaa et al. 2015). Increments in convergent thinking may therefore coincide with improvements in mindfulness that were observed in the present sample of ayahuasca users. It might be argued that post-ayahuasca changes in affect and thinking style that were observed in the present study are not related to a pharmacological effect of ayahuasca but due to uncontrolled confounders such as psychological expectations of participants prior to and after the ayahuasca ceremony. For example, participants may have been more stressed in anticipation of the ayahuasca ceremony which would explain why stress levels are higher at baseline, prior to the ceremony. Ideally, one would need to include a placebo group to control for the potential bias of expectation. This however is often impossible in observational studies that aim to assess the influence of ayahuasca in naturalistic environments. Yet, there are several strong indicators in the present study that suggest that changes in affect and thinking were directly related to the intake of ayahuasca. First, it was demonstrated that improvements in affect and cognition were significantly correlated with the strengths of ego dissolution during the ayahuasca experience. Higher ratings of ego dissolutions were associated with stronger reductions in symptoms of depression and stress and with improvements in mindfulness and satisfaction with life. This strongly suggests that changes in mood and thinking were intrinsically related to the actual ayahuasca experience. Second, anxiety levels were very low during baseline and follow-up sessions, which suggest that anxiety levels in anticipation of the ayahuasca ceremony were negligible. Finally, improvements in affect and cognition occurred independent of the previous ayahuasca experience of participants. The aforementioned rules out the possibility that changes were only apparent in first-time users who might be overly stressed by the novelty of the ayahuasca experience. In sum, this study presents supporting evidence for subacute and long-term improvements in affect and cognitive thinking style in non-pathological participants of ayahuasca ceremonies. Moreover, it was shown that improvements in affect and mindfulness are larger in participants who experience strong levels of ego dissolution during the acute phase of ayahuasca exposure. These data highlight the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as depression",
47,10.1177/2045125316689030,"The present systematic review reported evidence from case reports and case series associating ayahuasca or DMT intake with psychotic episodes enduring more than the expected time of action of each drug To the best of our knowledge, there is no published report of prolonged psychotic reactions associated with the use of ayahuasca in controlled settings [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. In these settings, volunteers are screened for a possible psychiatric history or a current psychiatric diagnosis, including psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, or a history of mania or hypomania induced by antidepressant or substance use [Riba et al. 2006; de Araujo et al. 2012; Osório et al. 2015; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; dos Santos et al. 2016b; Sanches et al. 2016]. The performance of a psychiatric screening before experimental or clinical use of hallucinogens is essential to reduce the possible occurrence of adverse reactions [Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. Therefore, a possible explanation for the occurrence of psychotic episodes could be the presence of previous psychiatric disorders Indeed, in the UDV case series [Lima et al. 2002; Lima and Tófoli, 2011], several psychotic episodes associated with ritual ayahuasca intake were related to previous psychiatric diagnoses or current symptomatology, including psychotic symptoms/disorders. Moreover, in the manic episode associated with ayahuasca intake, the subject had a family history of bipolar disorder and a personal history of hypomanic episodes [Szmulewicz et al. 2015]. Interestingly, acute ayahuasca administration to depressed patients screened for bipolar disorder or a history of mania/hypomania was not associated with increases in manic symptomatology [Osório et al. 2015; Sanches et al. 2016] In both the UDV case series [Lima et al. 2002; Lima and Tófoli, 2011] and in the case reports [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008] ayahuasca intake was also associated with psychotic episodes in people without a personal or family psychiatric history. However, in the case report, the use of other drugs (e.g. cannabis and other hallucinogens) complicates the assessment of the possible role of ayahuasca in the psychotic episode, and in the UDV case series no details are given regarding isolated cases, limiting their evaluation. In any case, the overall incidence of psychotic episodes in the UDV context seems to be rare. Gable reported that such cases represented a rate of less than 0.1% (0.052–0.096%) [Gable, 2007], which is comparable with the data reported by Cohen regarding controlled LSD administration [Cohen, 1960] Regarding DMT, we are also not aware of any published reports describing prolonged psychotic reactions associated with experimental/controlled DMT administration [e.g. Strassman et al. 1994, 1996; Daumann et al. 2008, 2010]. Volunteers in these studies are also psychiatrically screened for psychotic disorders before drug administration, thus limiting the possible occurrence of adverse reactions with psychotic features [Strassman, 1984; Daumann et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2008; Daumann et al. 2010; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. Like ayahuasca, in two of the case reports associated with smoked DMT, the subjects had a previous hypomanic/psychotic mania episode [Umut et al. 2011; Paterson et al. 2015], and in one case, the subject had a family history of psychotic disorder [Warren et al. 2013]. Furthermore, in all three cases the subjects used other drugs as well, especially cannabis. Like other hallucinogens, it seems that people with a personal or family psychiatric history of psychotic or manic episodes should avoid DMT intake [Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016] It is not clear why some people suffer prorogued psychotic reactions to ayahuasca or DMT. Mental health assessments of long-term ritual ayahuasca use do not report increased psychopathology in these population, and ayahuasca intake could even be related to better mental health [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. However, studies with experimented ayahuasca users could be biased by the fact that these people are already adapted to ayahuasca, having used this substance for several years or even decades in some cases [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. Therefore, it is possible that people that have adverse reactions to ayahuasca during their first experiences do not continue to use this hallucinogen anymore, and will not be present in studies assessing the mental health of long-term users. Previous prospective studies assessing the effects of a first ayahuasca intake in naïve users after 2 weeks [Barbosa et al. 2005] and 6 months [Barbosa et al. 2009] did not report adverse reactions with psychotic features, but observed reductions in psychiatric symptoms. More prospective studies following novice ayahuasca users for longer periods are need to better understand the effects of ayahuasca, both the negative and the therapeutic Nevertheless, the case reports describing the occurrence of psychotic episodes among the UDV members show that a minority of individuals may be predisposed to such experiences even in ritual settings. People with previous psychiatric diagnoses of psychotic disorders (schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders, psychotic depression or mania) or with current psychotic symptomatology seem to be the individuals with more predisposition to an adverse reaction with psychotic features, both for ayahuasca and DMT intake. Therefore, both in experimental/clinical and ritual settings, a previous psychiatric screening should be performed and individuals with such characteristics should avoid ayahuasca intake. This is similar for other hallucinogens [Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Studerus et al. 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. Indeed, in the case report described by dos Santos and Strassman, the second psychotic episode could be the result of both sensitization (increased susceptibility to the psychoactive effects of ayahuasca/DMT) and predisposition (increased tendency to suffer another psychotic reaction after a first-episode psychosis) induced by the first episode 1 year before [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008] The cases of people that had a psychotic episode with ayahuasca or DMT but that the subjects had no personal or family psychiatric history are more difficult to interpret. In the case of DMT, all reports described subjects with past or ongoing psychiatric symptomatology and use of other drugs that could also induce psychotic symptoms/disorders (e.g. cannabis and other hallucinogens). The case described by dos Santos and Strassman with ayahuasca also had an association with cannabis and other hallucinogens, even considering the absence of a personal or previous psychiatric history for the subject [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. Future studies should record not only the psychiatric history of the participants, but also the drug use history with detailed information on the type of drug used and the frequency and duration of such use. For instance, in two of the cases related to DMT the psychotic episode was apparently associated with an increase in the frequency/duration of DMT use, among other factors [Warren et al. 2013; Paterson et al. 2015]. Radiolabeled DMT remained for 7 days after injection in the rabbit brain [Vitale et al. 2011], suggesting the possibility that continuous use of DMT could increase brain levels of this compound over time, maybe reaching levels high enough to induce psychotic experiences, especially in predisposed individuals Unfortunately, although the UDV case series have described several psychotic episodes, they lack the detailed information present in the descriptions of the case reports. Thus, the UDV data is limited regarding the details of the psychiatric and drug use history of the subjects. It would be interesting to further explore the UDV data, and to assess if the religious setting of organized groups such as the UDV has any positive influence in how the person suffering a psychotic episode in that context copes with that experience Individuals predisposed to psychotic episodes after ayahuasca/DMT intake could share some genetic/metabolic characteristics that predispose them to such experiences. The so-called ‘transmethylation hypothesis’ suggests that an enzymatic/metabolic alteration could induce the organism to increase the synthesis of endogenous hallucinogenic compounds such as DMT, thus inducing psychosis/schizophrenia [Gillin et al. 1978; Barker et al. 1981; Ciprian-Ollivier and Cetkovich-Bakmas, 1997; Pomilio et al. 1999; Vitale et al. 2010; Barker et al. 2012; Grammenos and Barker, 2015]. However, although DMT is indeed an endogenous compound that has been detected in the human cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine [Barker et al. 2012], and some studies did find increased concentrations of DMT and related compounds (5-hydroxy-DMT, 5-methoxy-DMT) in the body fluids of psychotic/schizophrenic patients and other psychiatric patients [Barker et al. 2012], results are inconclusive and the transmethylation hypothesis is still under debate [Barker et al. 2012; Grammenos and Barker, 2015]. Moreover, although several authors have speculated on other possible physiological roles of endogenous DMT and related compounds in our organism, including regulation/production of dreams, near-death experiences, and mystical states [Callaway, 1988; Strassman, 2001], anxiolytic effects [Jacob and Presti, 2005], and tissue protection/regeneration and immune regulation [Frecska et al. 2013, 2016; Szabo et al. 2014], we still do not know what DMT is doing in our body. Additional research in this area is needed to better understand the presence of these compounds in humans There may be at least two explanations to understand the psychotic crisis reported in this paper, one psychological and another physiological. In the first case, maybe the subjects faced psychological content that unbalanced them. In the two cases in which we had personal contact with the subjects, they became paranoid, thinking that the people surrounding them wanted to harm them. At the same time, both subjects reacted quite well to treatment with atypical antipsychotics. In the case reported by dos Santos and Strassman, the subject apparently only became psychotic after taking drugs with hallucinogenic (ayahuasca, 2C-I) or hallucinogenic-like (MDMA) effects [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. Although MDMA is not considered a classic or serotonergic hallucinogen, it has hallucinogenic-like effects and may influence cortical 5-HT2A receptors [Mueller et al. 2016]. Moreover, the subject was successfully treated in all occasions with risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic that act as an antagonist of dopamine D1–2 receptors and of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The unpublished case report involving ayahuasca also described the effective (although transitory) use of risperidone, as well as one of the case reports involving DMT [Umut et al. 2011]. Thus, although a possible involvement of the dopaminergic system in the psychotic effects of hallucinogens cannot be ruled out, it seems that the psychotic crisis induced by ayahuasca, DMT, and other serotonergic hallucinogens may have their cause in their action on cortical 5-HT2A receptors. Solid evidence supporting this idea includes the fact that three of the reviewed cases reported successful use of an atypical antipsychotic with mixed dopamine and serotonin antagonism, and that the subject described by dos Santos and Strassman did not become psychotic after taking neither D2 agonists (cocaine, amphetamines) nor cannabis, but only after using serotoninergic compounds that act as 5-HT2A agonists [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. This is also in accordance with studies in which 5-HT2A antagonists reduced the effects of classic/serotonergic hallucinogens, including ayahuasca [Vollenweider et al. 1998; Kometer et al. 2013; Valle et al. 2016] However, the subject described by dos Santos and Strassman also described an extensive experience with other hallucinogens that act as 5-HT2A agonists (such as LSD and psilocybin) without psychotic incidents, and the last episode was apparently induced by excessive alcohol intake [dos Santos and Strassman, 2008]. It is not clear why these psychotic reactions occurred only with 2C-I, MDMA, and alcohol, but it is possible that after several psychotic episodes the subject may have developed an increased sensibility to psychotic symptoms that generalized to nonserotonergic drugs, or that the dose, intensity, or frequency of use of the other drugs was not sufficient to induce full-blown psychotic symptoms. Indeed, several of the cases reviewed described that the subjects had used several doses of ayahuasca/DMT before the psychotic episode, suggesting a possible dose-related or cumulative effect. The hallucinogenic effects of ayahuasca do not seem to be mediated by harmine and related β-carboline alkaloids (THH and harmaline), since human studies about their possible psychoactive properties are inconclusive, with reports describing hallucinogenic effects [Shulgin and Shulgin, 1997; Naranjo, 1959; Pennes and Hoch, 1957], sedative-like effects [Ott, 1994, 1999], or lack of psychoactive effects [Slotkin et al. 1970]. However, a recent study suggested that the β-carbolines in ayahuasca could have specific effects in the human electroencephalogram (EEG), suggesting central/psychoactive effects [Schenberg et al. 2015]. Moreover, compounds such as harmine may have pro-dopaminergic effects [Nunes et al. 2016], and the possible role of these compounds in the psychotic effects of ayahuasca is not currently known. Thus, more studies are needed to better understand the effects of the β-carboline alkaloids in humans. It is unknown if there are people vulnerable to hallucinogenic drugs, but in the two cases that we had direct contact subjects had no personal or familiar history of psychological problems, and were subjects perfectly adapted and with high qualified works and high educational levels. One of these subjects had a long history of ayahuasca use without having suffered any psychological side effect. Since he used cannabis and ayahuasca at the same time, it is possible cannabis could have potentiated the psychotic effects of DMT. In our field observations over the last 10–15 years, we have observed precisely this phenomenon [dos Santos, 2011]. Also, those two subjects suffered the psychotic crisis under the course of a structured ritual, and the UDV case series reported cases that occurred in this structured religious context. Thus, although the ritual may have some protective effect, it is not a total guarantee of complete safety [Lima, 1996–97; Lima and Tófoli, 2011]. Considering the good and fast response of those two subjects to antipsychotic medication, it could be possible that ayahuasca/DMT do not trigger a latent psychotic response in healthy individuals, but just induce a transitory psychotic crisis. But in people with a history of mental disorders, as was the case of some of the reports described in the present review, these substances could aggravate the premorbid condition. Therefore, although the psychological content of an ayahuasca experience can be sometimes difficult to face, it does not explain by itself a psychotic reaction. It is more probable that psychological side effects will appear in the form of transitory anxiety that disappears when the effects of ayahuasca fade away. But there may be conditions where the biochemical reactions induced by hallucinogens over 5-HT2A receptors induce a psychotic state that lasts more than the pharmacological effect of the drug, being necessary to rebalance the system/brain with a pharmacological/antipsychotic intervention that it is not dependent on the psychological content. Ayahuasca guides should be cautious in selecting people before giving them ayahuasca. Since ayahuasca use is being popularized internationally [Labate and Feeney, 2012], future studies should explore deeply the prevalence and incidence of psychiatric reactions in ayahuasca communities.","It is estimated that nearly 20 000 people worldwide are members of some of the Brazilian ayahuasca religions (Santo Daime, UDV, Barquinha) [Labate et al. 2009]. The scientific literature suggests that acute ayahuasca administration to healthy volunteers has a good safety profile, and that long-term ritual ayahuasca consumption is not associated with cognitive or psychiatric problems [dos Santos et al. 2016a]. The psychotic episodes described in the present systematic review are apparently associated with several contributing factors, and not only ayahuasca or DMT intake. Many cases involved individuals with a personal or family history of psychosis or nonpsychotic bipolar disorder, or concomitant use of other drugs. Therefore, these individuals have a different profile from those that participate in controlled studies where a psychiatric screening is performed and use of other drugs is not allowed. Moreover, in controlled studies, only single or few ayahuasca/DMT doses are administered, and in some cases described, related to DMT use, the subjects have used several doses DMT before their psychotic episode Previous reviews of adverse effects of hallucinogens in noncontrolled/recreational settings demonstrated that in reports ‘from the field’ it is very difficult to tease apart preexisting psychopathology, drug/alcohol abuse, family history, and other important features such as proper preparation, guidance, and integration of drug effects. Thus, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship with hallucinogen use and most of these cases [Klock et al. 1974; Strassman, 1984; Johnson et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2014; Garcia-Romeu et al. 2016]. In the case reports described in the present review, it is similarly difficult to determine the significance of ayahuasca/DMT use in such complicated settings, especially considering the safety record of ayahuasca/DMT administration in controlled clinical trials where rigorous screening, supervision, and follow up are provided Taken together, these results suggest that the incidence of psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca/DMT intake is a rare phenomenon, and these rare instances appear be associated with previous premorbid characteristics of the individuals, previous and possibly concurrent drug abuse, and lack of a supervised setting. Therefore, considering the possible influence of these and other factors, the causal relation between ayahuasca/DMT and these cases is not always clear. These data suggest that performance of a psychiatric and drug use history before ayahuasca or DMT administration in controlled settings may reduce the occurrence of psychotic experiences. Regarding noncontrolled/recreational use, individuals with personal or family history of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders, psychotic depression or mania, or with ongoing manic or psychotic symptomatology, should avoid ayahuasca/DMT intake"
48,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.10.026,"We have conducted a systematic review to examine the acute and long-term effects of serotonergic hallucinogens in humans using neuroimaging methods. Neurochemical imaging studies [PET and SPECT] involving acute oral administration of mescaline, psilocybin, and ayahuasca suggest that these drugs induce excitatory effects in frontolateral/frontomedial cortex, medial temporal lobe, and amygdala – regions involved in self-awareness, cognitive functioning, memory and emotion processing. These results were consistent across studies. Furthermore, these studies were performed in separated laboratories and used different drugs and neuroimaging technics. Studies using fMRI and involving acute oral [ayahuasca] or intravenous [DMT, psilocybin, LSD] administration of serotonergic hallucinogens showed less consistent results. Most resting-state fMRI studies showed significant reductions in brain activation in the same regions where neurochemical imaging studies showed increased activation, as well as in other regions such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, and visual areas (Daumann et al., 2010, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015) According to Carhart-Harris et al. (2012a), the inconsistence between PET/SPECT and fMRI results could be related to the time-scales considered in the different techniques. Thus, the radiotracers used to measure blood perfusion/glucose metabolism have long half-lives [e.g., the radiotracer 18F FDG, used to measure glucose metabolism, has a half-life of 110 min], using much greater time-scales than fMRI measures. Therefore, phasic or short-term effects of psilocybin could show some compensating/rebound effect that is detected by PET or SPECT (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a) However, nonsignificant (Daumann et al., 2008, Speth et al., 2016), mixed (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014), and opposite (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) results were also reported in fMRI studies. Moreover, an active-task fMRI study reported significant increases in memory-related activations in the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, mid-cingulate cortex, pre-sensorimotor area, precuneus, subgenual cingulate cortex, temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, and visual and other sensory cortical areas after intravenous psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b), and another fMRI study using an imagery task showed that oral ayahuasca induced a significant activation in the primary visual area comparable to the activation levels of a natural image with the eyes open, and ayahuasca also activated the cuneus and lingual gyrus and parahippocampal, retrosplenial, and frontopolar cortices (de Araujo et al., 2012). Also, an fMRI study reported that oral psilocybin significantly attenuated right amygdala activation to both negative and neutral pictures and that this effect was significantly correlated with increases in positive mood (Kraehenmann et al., 2015a) Interpretation of functional connectivity results is even more difficult. Functional connectivity alterations in key hubs of the DMN were observed in several studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016, Lebedev et al., 2015, Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015, Kaelen et al., 2016), which partially corroborates the neuroanatomical substrates where PET/SPECT studies found alterations in blood perfusion/glucose metabolism. Moreover, functional connectivity studies reported increased coupling between cortical networks, suggesting an increased integration between cortical regions (de Araujo et al., 2012, Petri et al., 2014, Roseman et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Kaelen et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Furthermore, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex (Kraehenmann et al., 2015b), and the interaction between music and LSD increased parahippocampal cortex/visual cortex functional connectivity and parahippocampal cortex to visual cortex information flow (Kaelen et al., 2016) Regarding structural MRI studies, one study with regular ayahuasca users reported significant cortical thinning in mesotemporal and inferior frontal gyri, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior occipital gyrus; and increased thickening in precentral gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex (Bouso et al., 2015). Importantly, there was no evidence of increased psychopathology in the ayahuasca group, suggesting that the structural alterations were not associated with psychopathologies. Moreover, inverse correlations were found between changes in cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate cortex and age of onset of ayahuasca use, intensity of prior ayahuasca use, and “self-transcendence”/spirituality Another structural MRI study investigated SERT and 5-HT2A receptor binding in polydrug, hallucinogen-preferring users and found no effects regarding SERT values and a slight reduction on 5-HT2A receptor densities (Erritzoe et al., 2011). However, significant effects on 5-HT2A receptor densities were observed only when both group of MDMA/hallucinogens users were analyzed together, suggesting that part of this effect might be more related to MDMA than to serotonergic hallucinogens (Mueller et al., 2016). Moreover, regional decreases in neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding were of only 9% in the neocortex, and when two controls with very high 5-HT2A receptor binding values were excluded from the sample the difference between groups was no longer significant The reviewed human data is corroborated by several preclinical studies showing that administration of serotonergic hallucinogens induce genetic, neurochemical, and behavioral alterations in/associated with brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus [see for review Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Nichols, 2016]. A recent study in rats reported that acute ayahuasca administration was associated with decreased concentrations of glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA] in the amygdala, increased GABA levels in the hippocampus, and an increased utilization rate of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin in the amygdala (de Castro-Neto et al., 2013). In another recent study, prolonged [30 days] ayahuasca administration to rats interfered with emotional memory, a process involving the hippocampus and the amygdala (Favaro et al., 2015), and Pic-Taylor et al. (2015) administered ayahuasca to rats to investigate patterns of neuronal activation using c-fos marked neurons and found higher neuronal activation in the dorsal raphe nuclei, amygdaloid nucleus, and hippocampal formation after ayahuasca administration. A recent study showed that acute administration of psilocin [the active metabolite of psilocybin] significantly increased MRI signal in the rat hypothalamus, olfactory regions, amygdala, and other limbic regions, and also increased cerebral blood flow in the somatosensory cortex after sensorial stimuli. However, MRI signal decreases were observed in the cingulate, motor, and somatosensory cortices [among other regions], and the amplitude of neuronal responses [local field potentials] to sensory stimuli in the somatosensory cortex was also decreased, suggesting an altered relationship between evoked neuronal and haemodynamic response magnitudes (Spain et al., 2015) The results by Spain et al. (2015) are corroborated by a recent study in humans showing that psilocybin induced significant increases on BOLD signal variance and total spectral power in the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral hippocampi, while significant decreases were observed in local field potentials in the DMN, executive control, and dorsal attention networks (Tagliazucchi et al., 2014). Their study by Spain et al. (2015) could help to explain, at least in part, the discrepancy between PET/SPECT findings of increased blood perfusion/glucose metabolism and fMRI results showing decreased cerebral blood flow. Moreover, neurophysiological studies in humans using electroencephalography [EEG] and MEG consistently show that serotonergic hallucinogens decrease the power of lower frequency oscillations [theta/alpha frequency range, <20 Hz], especially alpha oscillations [8–12 Hz], in key regions of the DMN such as the anterior/posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal region, which induces an excitatory effect (Riba et al., 2002, Riba et al., 2004, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Kometer et al., 2015, Valle et al., 2016) Although the neural effects of serotonergic hallucinogens may involve serotonergic [e.g., 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors] and non-serotonergic [e.g., dopaminergic and sigma receptors] neurotransmission, the agonist effect of these drugs on deep-layer pyramidal neurons rich in 5-HT2A receptors seem to be the main mechanism of action of these compounds (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Hintzen and Passie, 2010, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, Kometer et al., 2012, Kometer et al., 2013, Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Baumeister et al., 2014, Tylš et al., 2014, Halberstadt, 2015, Nichols, 2016, Valle et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). Agonism at these receptors expressed in frontal and medial cortical areas produce altered synchronization of cortical activity (Riba et al., 2002, Riba et al., 2004, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Petri et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Valle et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), “disintegration” of network connectivity (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2016, Lebedev et al., 2015, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), increased excitability of multimodal association hubs (Riba et al., 2004, Riba et al., 2006, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016), and altered information flow (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Alonso et al., 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016, Kaelen et al., 2016). These effects create a state of “expanded awareness”, “ego-dissolution”, and “unconstrained cognition” (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013, Petri et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2014, Tagliazucchi et al., 2016, Gallimore, 2015, McKenna and Riba, 2015, Lebedev et al., 2015, Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016) Agonism at frontocortical 5-HT2A receptors also modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission and may increase the expression of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor [GDNF], thus enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis by increasing the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons (González-Maeso et al., 2008, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, Moreno et al., 2011, Moreno et al., 2013, Hanks and González-Maeso, 2013, Baumeister et al., 2014, Carbonaro et al., 2015, Halberstadt, 2015, Nichols, 2016) Interestingly, these effects seem to be the neural basis involved in the therapeutic potentials of these compounds. Preclinical and human research suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties (dos Santos et al., 2016a, dos Santos et al., 2016b, Nunes et al., 2016). Indeed, acute administration of DMT (Gillin, 1976, Strassman et al., 1994, Riba et al., 2015), psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, Studerus et al., 2011, Kometer et al., 2012, Kraehenmann et al., 2015a), LSD (Schmid et al., 2015), and ayahuasca (Osório et al., 2015, Sanches et al., 2016) is associated with increases in positive mood. Furthermore, the studies reviewed show that serotonergic hallucinogens decrease DMN activity, which is increased during rumination, an important depressive symptom. Together with decreases in amygdala activity (Kraehenmann et al., 2015a, Kraehenmann et al., 2015b), reduced DMN activity may be another possible mechanism involved in the antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of these drugs. Moreover, observational studies also suggest that psilocybin, LSD, and ayahuasca may have therapeutic potentials (Krebs and Johansen, 2013, Hendricks et al., 2014, Hendricks et al., 2015, Johansen and Krebs, 2015, dos Santos et al., 2016a, dos Santos et al., 2016b, Nunes et al., 2016) Psychological mechanisms also play a role in the therapeutic properties of these drugs, and appear to be related to neuroimaging findings. For instance, in the retrospective MRI study of long-term ayahuasca users, the ayahuasca group not only scored higher than controls in “self-transcendence”, but scores were negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate cortex (Bouso et al., 2015) “Self-transcendence” is a character dimension related to religiousness and spirituality, and the beneficial effects of serotonergic hallucinogens appear to be related to their ability to elicit religious/mystical experiences (Kurland et al., 1971, McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971, Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981, Grof, 2001, Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, Hintzen and Passie, 2010, Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010, MacLean et al., 2011, Krebs and Johansen, 2012, Baumeister et al., 2014, Kometer et al., 2015, Majić et al., 2015). Indeed, psilocybin induced religious-like experiences in healthy volunteers, with sustained improvements in attitudes, mood, and personality (Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011, MacLean et al., 2011), and psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience, together with the overall intensity of the experience, were correlated with improvements in tobacco (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014, Johnson et al., 2014) and alcohol (Bogenschutz et al., 2015) dependence. Moreover, the religious-like effects of LSD were associated with sustained improvements in patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases (Gasser et al., 2014, Gasser et al., 2015). Interestingly, decreased DMN activity and decreased DMN-TPN inverse coupling were observed not only after administration of serotonergic hallucinogens, but also in meditation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014, de Araujo et al., 2012) Taken together, the neuroimaging data reviewed suggests that serotonergic hallucinogens produce their effects by modulating brain areas associated with perception and emotion processing, executive functions, and other complex cognitive functions. Specifically, these group of compounds may induce acute increases in blood perfusion/glucose metabolism in prefrontal and limbic areas involved in the regulation of mood, interoception, cognition, and consciousness; decreases in reactivity of brain structures related to anxiety/fear processing such as the amygdala; and reduced brain activity in key regions of the DMN, involved in mind-wandering and self-awareness. Somehow, the altered state of consciousness produced by serotonergic hallucinogens appears to create a disruption of repetitive, rigid, and pathological patterns of negative thoughts and emotions, commonly observed in anxiety and mood disorders and in drug dependence, and this effect may be therapeutically relevant. Finally, long-term use of these drugs was also associated with cortical thickness alterations in important areas of the DMN, such as the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices A main limitation of the present systematic review is the inclusion of studies with small sample sizes, high degree of heterogeneity, and without placebo or control groups. Other important limitations include the variety of doses of the same compound used in different studies and the difficulty in accurately measuring drug dose/composition in retrospective studies However, despite these important limitations, the reviewed results suggest that the neural basis of the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens involve an agonist action of these drugs on 5-HT2A receptors expressed in deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the fronto-parieto-occipito-temporal cortex, involved in perception, memory, and emotion processing, cognitive functions, regulation of neurotrophic factors, and consciousness. Moreover, although the mechanisms of action responsible for the effects produced by serotonergic hallucinogens are not completely understood, the available evidence suggest that these drugs may not only improve our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, consciousness, and other complex topics, but may also have therapeutic uses in treatment-resistant patients with anxiety and mood disorders or drug dependence. Further development of neuroimaging techniques, better sample and drug delivery standardizations and the integration of data across neuroimaging modalities may extend progress in this important field",
49,10.1177/0269881116679368,"We have collated and summarized the pre-prohibition literature on the use of psychedelics  in the treatment of broadly defined UMD in Table 1. 22 studies published between 1949 and  1973 were included. LSD was, by far, the most commonly used psychedelic. Mescaline was  occasionally used. The absence of psilocybin is discussed below. The sample size ranged from  5 to 77, with a total aggregated sample size of 423 across all the studies where this was clearly  defined.  The  number  of  psychedelic  sessions  ranged  from  1  to  58 and  the  therapeutic paradigms applied were variable. The dose of LSD used ranged from 20 micrograms to 1,500  micrograms. Mescaline  was  used  at  doses  of  200-400mg, in  combination  with  LSD. Many  studies used titrated dosing schedules that took account of individual patient responses to  the drug. Savage(Savage,  Fadiman,  Mogar  and  Allen,  1966b),  in  1966,  neatly  summarized the  methodological difficulties of these pre-prohibition papers. “Nearly  all  studies  have  serious  shortcomings…namely,  1)  anecdotal  evidence;  2)  inadequate  assessment  procedures;  3)  insufficient  follow  up;  4)  naïve  statistical  treatment; 5) lack of controls.”. We agree with these criticisms, noting also that a meta-analytical approach to the reported  studies is  impossible  as  continuous  outcome measures  were  only  collected  by  1  research  group. Only 4 studies have any mention of a control group(Savage, 1952; Savage et al., 1973;  B Sloane and Lovett Doust, 1954; Whitaker, 1964) and in only one(Savage et al., 1973) could  the  control  group  be  deemed  to  be  A)  adequately  selected  and  B)  adequately  described.  Outcomes  measures  were  generally  so  vague  that  the  only  meaningful  grouping  was  a  dichotomous variable reflecting those who were felt by their clinicians to have ‘improved’, as  opposed to those that didn’t. Given the heterogeneity in definition, ‘improvement’ cannot be  further defined. Clearly this is subject to bias and is neither systematic nor objective. In those  studies  where  the  number  of  patients  who  were  deemed  to  have  improved  was  actually  specified (19  out  of  22),  335  (79.2%) out of 423 patients  were  judged  to  have  improved,  ranging in the various studies from 40% to 95%. Studies using higher doses of psychedelics  and/or combining psychedelics with psychotherapy or psychological support appear to show  better results. In  an  attempt  to  delineate  more  classical  depressive disorders  from  the  wider  clinical  definitions  of  ‘anxiety’  and  ‘neurotic’  disorders  subsumed  within  our  analysis,  we  also  repeated  this analysis  restricted  to  cases  classified as ‘depressives,’ ‘depressive  reactions,’  and ‘depressive neuroses’, where this was specified. Of the papers where there was sufficient  information  to  do  this  (11  out  of  a  total  of  21  papers)  improvement  was  seen  in  73.7%  (101/137). Further restricting the sample to purely ‘depressives’ and ‘depressive reactions’,  improvement was seen in 72.5% (58/80). Data on those who were felt to have worsened with  treatment was  either  incomplete,  or  not  included  at  all.  The  degree  of  improvement  is  notable even if the presumption must be that it is biased in favour of a therapeutic effect.  The research deserves repetition in a modern, controlled context. In response to the Thalidomide tragedy, the US introduced the Kefauver-Harris Drug Efficacy  Amendments in 1962, which required well controlled trials to evidence a drug’s efficacy and  safety  before  it  could  be  marketed(Peltzman,  1973).  These changes heralded  modern  paradigms of trial design, which rely on randomisation of individuals to a placebo or active  treatment, and blinding of both assessor and participants to the intervention. This is thought  to partially compensate for selection, performance and detection bias and serves to isolate the effect of the drug from the confounds of its surroundings. However, there are inherent  difficulties with such designs when psychotropic drugs are being used, and particularly with  psychedelics(Oram, 2012), for four reasons. Firstly, blinding is largely impossible. Therapeutic doses of psychedelics induce subjective and  objective changes in feeling, thinking and behaviour that are usually obvious both to recipient  and observer. Secondly, and on this basis, placebo control is problematic because the absence  of the psychedelic effect is also obvious. Thirdly, and perhaps most pertinently to psychedelic  trials, the ‘set’  (psychological state) and ‘setting’  (interpersonal and physical environment) within  which  the  drug  is  experienced  are  inextricably  linked  to  the  therapeutic  effect(Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1997). Attempting to isolate the drug from these variables, as  modern trials attempt to do, will miss the widely accepted point that the therapeutic effect  is  subsumed  within,  and  inextricable  from,  the  interaction  between  psychedelic,  set  and  setting. Finally, and a point common to trials in mood disorders in general, the diagnostic and  aetiological heterogeneity in patients diagnosed with UMD is famously wide. Some patients  have broadly adaptive personalities with particular sensitivities to certain stressors. Others  have  chronic  and  enduring  patterns  of  learned  helplessness or  other  personality  factors.  Others may have biologically mediated mood problems derived from subclinical imbalances  in  immune  or endocrine  function. Most  will  have  a variable mixture  of  these  factors  contributing to the clinical picture. Consequently, routine clinical treatments for UMDs are  also  variable, requiring a flexibility  in  clinical  approach  that  modern  trial  designs  are  particularly designed to avoid. Active  placebos  have  been  used to attempt  to compensate  for difficulties in  blinding  and  placebo  control.  In  a  randomized,  double  blind  trial  using  psilocybin in  psychedelic-naïve  volunteers over two or three sessionsto investigate mystical experiences, clinicians were told  that participants would receive at least one dose of psilocybin, but that at other sessions a  variety of other drugs might be administered(Griffiths et al., 2006). They were then asked to  guess  the  drugs  used  immediately  after  each  session.  In  fact,  only  psilocybin  or  methylphenidate  were  used  in  the  trial.  23%  of  sessions  were  misclassified  (that  is,  the  clinician  either  thought  a  methylphenidate session  was a psilocybin session or that  a psilocybin session was  something  other  than  psilocybin).  However when  clinicians  did misclassify a  session  they  tended  to misclassify a methylphenidate  session as a  psilocybin  session. Furthermore, when psilocybin was given but the clinician did not accurately guess  this, most participants still reported deeply meaningful, mystical experiences. This suggests  that  the  occurrence  of  a  mystical experience  is  not  likely  to  be  an  artefact simply  of  expectation or suggestion(Griffiths et al., 2006), and may suggest that the double blind, active  placebo condition is a more favourable trial design. Randomisation between low and high  doses of psychedelic is also a credible design strategy given the difficulties described, a design that was  partially implemented in  a  study  in  1973  by  Savage  et  al.  included  in  this  review(Savage et al., 1973). This showed statistically significant superiority of LSD at a dose  of  350  micrograms when  compared  to conventional  treatment  over  a  wide  range  of  psychological  test  variables  in  a  sample  of  96  patients  with  ‘severe  chronic  neuroses’ randomized to low dose LSD, high dose LSD and treatment as usual. Correction for multiple  statistical comparisons was not performed. Attempts to standardize the context, or setting, of the psychedelic experience are possible in  controlled trials, but the number of variables implied by this and the pragmatics of controlling  them, suggests that a significant degree of variation is unavoidable. Whilst the dose of drug  and basic environmental context (the layout of the room, decoration, sound and ambience,  for example) can be largely controlled in medical research settings, the psychotherapy itself  must inevitably  be  flexible. Defined  training  programs in  psychedelic  research  and  psychotherapy  are  now  being  set  up  to  provide  some structure  for  this,  such  as  the new  ‘Certificate in Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapies & Research’ in California, which took its  inaugural intake of students in 2015(Denenmark, 2015). However, a raft of questions remain  to be answered. In the pre-prohibition literature, distinction was made between ‘psycholytic’  therapy, which used low doses of psychedelics to facilitate access to unconscious material,  and  ‘psychedelic’  therapy,  which  used  high  doses  to  elicit  therapeutic  mystical/spiritual  experiences. There is some evidence that mystical experiences with psilocybin are associated  with  increased  well-being  and  personal  meaning  over  a  year  later(Griffiths  et  al.,  2008),  however it is not known whether one paradigm is generally superior to the other, or whether  there is variation in response according to disorder and paradigm used.Carefully  designed  clinical  trials  that  incorporate  biological  mechanism  studies  may  help  resolve some questions. For example, the dichotomy between the more verbal ‘psycholytic’ paradigm and the largely ineffable ‘psychedelic’ paradigm raises the question of whether they reflect a common continuum of response to psychedelics, or distinct entities in themselves. Modern neurobiology and neuroimaging studies may help answer this question, and ideally  such appraisals of mechanism will need to be embedded within clinical efficacy trials. If the  two paradigms appear mechanistically distinct in terms of neurobiology, it may suggest that  the  two  paradigms  will  have  different  therapeutic  efficacies  in  different  disorders  and,  perhaps, different personality  types. However,  there should be  robust ethical scrutiny and  oversight  of  trial  designs  that  expose  clinical  trial  participants,  who  by  definition  will  be  psychiatrically  unwell,  to  the  emotional  difficulties  implicit  in  brain  scanning  and  blood  sampling. Hitherto, neuroimaging studies using psychedelics have been restricted to healthy  volunteers. In summary, it appears that a particularly careful and well-considered balance between the  needs  of  the  participants  and  the  needs  of  the  trial  will  be  required in  studies  using  psychedelics. Funders and research ethics committees will need to understand the inherent  difficulties  discussed  above  if  they  are  to scrutinize trial  designs  using  psychedelics successfully,  and  trial  designers  will  need,  similarly,  to  be  detailed  and  explicit  about  the  environmental and  psychotherapeutic milieu  in which a  study is  to  be performed.  Clinical  trials using psychedelics will need to be sufficiently methodologically detailed at the point of  publication to allow genuine replication. Scientific mechanism studies will need, ideally, to be  pursued  alongside  clinical  trials if  this  is  pragmatic  and  ethical. Within  this multi-pronged  approach to evidence gathering, and a sufficient degree of definition, replicable results and  common threads of insight into the nature and applicability of psychedelics to medicine in  general, and to psychiatry in particular, should emerge with time. Psilocybin  was  marketed  under  the  trade  name  ‘Indocybin’ by  the  same  pharmaceutical  company  that  marketed  LSD  (Sandoz).  Whilst  it  was  used  in  individual  patients,  this  systematic review did not find any clinical trials of its pre-prohibition use in broadly defined  mood disorder. This is likely to be because psilocybin (and its active metabolite, psilocin) were  not isolated until 1959, and the drug marketed after this(Hofmann et al., 1959). By this time, LSD research was well underway and it is likely that most clinicians would have wanted to  stick  to  what  was  an  established  pharmaceutical  entity,  rather  than  risk  the  potential  complications of trying a new one. With this in mind, it is notable that psilocybin has been  favoured over LSD in modern clinical trials. There are several possible reasons for this. Firstly,  psilocybin  has  a shorter  duration  of  action than  LSD  or  mescaline,  which  makes  day-case  treatment sessions feasible, without the need for supervised (and costly) overnight hospital stays. Secondly, anecdotal evidence from recreational users suggests that psilocybin is less  liable  to  occasion  highly  distressing  psychological  reactions (although  this  may simply  be  because psilocybin is easier to measure than LSD). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, LSD remains a particularly stigmatized drug. Not only is this likely to colour individual experiences  of the drug effect, but it is also likely that this stigma still negatively affects the chances of  successful applications to grant funders and research ethics committees. These observations lead naturally to a discussion about the risks of using psychedelic drugs in  medical  and  recreational  settings. Physiologically, psychedelics (particularly  LSD  and  psilocybin) are notably safe. LSD and psilocybin have a toxicity ratio (estimated lethal dose as  a ratio of the estimated therapeutic dose) of one thousand or more (alcohol, by comparison,  has a toxicity ratio of about 10, cocaine about 15, ketamine about 38 and fluoxetine about  100)(Gable, 2004).  The risk of harm from recreational use of psychedelics should not be conflated with the risk  of harm from medical use. Turning to recreational use first. In 2010, an analysis of harms to  the end-user and society caused by a range of recreationally used psychoactive substances  ranked LSD and psilocybin amongst the safest of all those studied(Nutt et al., 2010), however  the precipitation of psychotic disorders by psychedelics remains a concern. Carhart-Harris et  al,  in  a  web-based  self-report  questionnaire  of  recreational  use  of  psychedelics,  noted  prolonged psychotic reactions were reported by 1.3% (six of 463) of LSD users and 1.6% (eight  of  503)  of  psilocybin  users  in  their  sample(Carhart-Harris  and  Nutt,  2010).  Howevr,  this  proportion included those reporting derealisation, which is generally classified as an anxiety  derived phenomenon rather than a psychotic phenomenon. Despite this, the prevalence is  not  significantly  greater  than  might  be  expected  in  the  general  population.  Three  large  population studies have found that use of psychedelics is associated with a lower relative risk of  suicide(Hendricks  et  al.,  2015),  need  for  psychiatric  medication  and  psychological  distress(Johansen  and  Krebs,  2015),  and  recidivism(Hendricks  et  al.,  2014).  Despite the  authors  attempting  to  correct  for  socio-demographic  variables  in  these  studies,  it  is  still  possible that these results are confounded by users of psychedelics tending not to be from  such  socially  disadvantaged  groups  when  compared  to  users  of  other  recreationally  used  substances. Very rare, reports of recreational users committing apparent acts of suicide whilst  under  the influence  of  psychedelics  do exist, and are  unfortunately emphasized  by media  outlets(Keeler and Reifler, 1967; Reynolds and Jindrich, 1985). Turning  to  harm  in medical  settings, Cohen noted  a  single case  of  prolonged  (>48  hours)  psychosis in a survey of 1,200 research participants given psychedelics, and this case turned  out to have an identical twin suffering with schizophrenia(Cohen, 1960). Savage et al. in 1973  noted that of ‘the nearly 500 diverse patients treated [with LSD]’ only 2 cases of psychosis  were noted. This first was in a 21-year-old patient with ‘severe chronic neurosis’ treated with  350  micrograms of  LSD.  This  patient  had a  history  of  psychotic  episodes in  the  past, and  recovered with psychotherapy and antipsychotic medication. The second case was a ‘schizoid  subject’  with  a  history  of  alcoholism,  but  no  further  details  were  given  about  the  case. According  to  recent guidelines(M  Johnson et al.,  2008), the  first  two of  these participants would have been excluded from participation in modern trials, whilst it is impossible to tell  whether the third would or would not have. In the most comprehensive review of specific adverse reactions to psychedelics in medical and  recreational settings,  Strassman(Strassman,  1984) pointed  out  that  researcher’s  and  clinician’s attitudes to psychedelics appeared to result in considerable variation in judgement  about what was, and was not, considered a risk or an adverse event “It  is  important  to  use  caution  in  discussing  the  concept  of  adverse  reactions  to  psychedelic drugs. At one extreme are those who believe that the drug-induced state  itself is either primarily a pathological one, i.e. a ""model psychosis"", or that the desire  to induce such a state is a function of pre-existing personality dysfunction. At the other  extreme is the view that even the most disorganized,  frightened, dysfunctional, and  regressed  reactions  to  psychedelic  drugs  are  necessary/healthy  reactions  seen  in throwing  off  ""straight""  society’s  ""shackles""  and  in  reaching  a  ""higher""  level  of  consciousness. The description and/or reporting of adverse reactions to psychedelics  is, therefore, subject to some degree of investigators’ perspective on the use of these  drugs.” As a natural extension of this, Strassman also points out, about LSD: “One of the most confounding aspects of almost all studies of either acute or chronic  effects  of  LSD  is  their  lack  of  pre-LSD  data.  The  role  of  LSD  in  producing  ""LSD  psychoses,"" brain damage, long-lasting personality change, and flashbacks is difficult,  if not impossible to discern without pre-LSD values for the dependent variables” His conclusions about the adverse effects of LSD are summed up in the following paragraph: “With  the  available  data,  it  appears  that  the  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  to  psychedelic drugs is low when individuals, both normal volunteers and patients, are  carefully  screened  and  prepared,  supervised  and  followed  up,  and  given  judicious  doses  of  pharmaceutical  quality  drug.  The  few  prospective  studies  noting  adverse  reactions have fairly consistently described characteristics predicting poor response to  these drugs. The majority of studies of adverse reactions, retrospective in nature, have  described a constellation of premorbid characteristics in individuals seeking treatment  for  these  reactions  where  drugs  of  unknown  purity  were  taken  in  unsupervised  settings.” Whilst  such  research  certainly  deserves  repetition  (particularly  because  modern  research  with psychedelics is tending to use psilocybin) a summation of the evidence suggests that the  risks associated with medically controlled and supervised use of psychedelics are low and that  evidence-based  guidelines(M  Johnson  et  al.,  2008) improve  safety  even  further. In  this  context it is also notable that far more dangerous substances, such as opiates, are routinely  used in medical therapy even though recreational use is also widespread, and certainly much  more dangerous than recreational use of psychedelics. No deaths have been unambiguously  linked to the physiological toxicity of classical serotonergic psychedelics whereas in 2014, in the  US  alone,  10,574 people died  of street  heroin  overdoses,  and  a  further  18,893  from  prescription opiate overdoses(National Center for Health Statistics, 2015).  A single pilot study of psilocybin in the treatment of resistant major depressive disorder was  recently  completed  in  the United  Kingdom(Carhart-Harris,  Bolstridge,  et  al.,  2016).  In this  open-label  feasibility  trial,  12  patients with  treatment-resistant  unipolar major  depression  received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart, in a supportive setting,  with psychological  support and medical  supervision before, during and after each  session.  Follow up was from 1 week to 3 months post treatment. 8 of 12 patients achieved complete remission  of  symptoms  at  1  week  and  7  patients  (58%)  continued  to  meet  criteria  for  response (50% reduction in BDI score relative to baseline) at 3 months, with 5 of these still in  complete remission. The therapy was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. The  American  psychologist  and  LSD  researcher,  Betty  Eisner,  summarised  the  psychotherapeutic  mechanism  by  which  LSD,  and  by  implication  other  psychedelics,  may  work as follows(Eisner and Cohen, 1958): 1) LSD lessens defensiveness 2) There is a heightened capacity to relive early experiences with accompanying release  of feelings 3) Therapist-patient relationships are enhanced 4) There is an increased appearance of unconscious material. If the aetiology of UMD in some patients can be understood, at least in part, as the present  day emotional and behavioural sequelae of unresolved traumas and emotional conflicts from  the  past, with anxieties about  the  future,  it  is  reasonable  to hypothesize that  psychedelic  psychotherapy will catalyse the resolution of such conflicts in a proportion of patients where  other treatment modalities have failed. There is a pressing economic need for such interventions. Unipolar depressive disorder costs  the  United  States  alone  over  $210  billion  annually(Greenberg  et  al.,  2015).  Response  to  treatment is often suboptimal and entrenched, maladaptive patterns of thought, feeling and  behaviour are the hallmark of resistance to treatment. Whilst long, detailed forms of dynamic, analytical and behavioural psychotherapy may change such patterns over the course of years they  are  expensive  and  time  consuming.  Psychedelic  therapy  may represent a  form  of  catalysed psychotherapy  whereby  the  drug  acts  to  hasten the  breakdown of  habitual maladaptive templates of  thinking and behaviour in  supportive  therapeutic environments.  The evidence from the pre-prohibition literature, whilst unsystematic and methodologically  suboptimal, suggests that this is worth re-investigating. Furthermore, a recent pilot study in  treatment resistant depressive disorder has shown encouraging results. Taken together, the  evidence  suggests  that  there  is  a strong  medical  and  economic  argument  for the  further  investigation  of  psychedelics  in  the  treatment  of  unipolar  mood  disorders  in  sensitively  designed, modern clinical trials",
50,10.1056/NEJMoa2032994,"In this 6-week randomized trial comparing psilocybin with escitalopram in patients with long-standing, mild-to-severe depression, the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6 (the primary outcome) did not differ significantly between the trial groups. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram; however, the confidence intervals for the between-group differences were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and no conclusions can be drawn from these data. In both trial groups, the scores on the depression scales at week 6 were numerically lower than the baseline scores, but the absence of a placebo group in the trial limits conclusions about the effect of either agent alone. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups, and no serious adverse events occurred. The percentages of patients who had anxiety, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, or reduced emotional responsiveness were higher in the escitalopram group than in the psilocybin group.19 Four patients in the escitalopram group stopped taking their daily capsules entirely, and 1 patient halved the dose because of perceived adverse events. No patient in the psilocybin group requested to cancel the second psilocybin dose. Three patients were unable to attend sessions to receive the second psilocybin dose owing to the Covid-19 lockdown (2 patients in the psilocybin group and 1 in the escitalopram group). The most common adverse event in the psilocybin group was transient headache reported within 24 hours after the day of psilocybin dosing. The incidence of headache was similar to those reported in previous studies of psilocybin Acute subjective effects of psilocybin relating to the psychedelic experience were not included as adverse events in our trial, because previous studies have suggested that they may have a mediating influence on positive outcomes.21 The altered quality of conscious experience typically induced by a 25-mg dose of psilocybin adds complexity to this treatment model, because it requires that psychological support be provided to patients during and after treatment sessions.15 This requirement informed this trial’s screening criteria that excluded patients with preexisting psychiatric conditions believed to be incompatible with the limited psychological support that could be made available within the trial. This exclusion criterion may have biased the trial sample toward patients who could receive psilocybin without unacceptable side effects. However, psychological support was provided for both groups in this trial, and it is possible that the adjunctive psychological support improved outcomes among those in the escitalopram group A limitation of the trial is the brief duration of escitalopram treatment, because this drug has a delayed therapeutic action on depression.22 Had the course of escitalopram been extended, it is possible that better efficacy would have been observed among the patients in the escitalopram group. Patients who received the 25-mg dose of psilocybin rated the intensity of acute subjective effects higher than patients who received the 1-mg dose (Fig. S7). We did not assess the effectiveness of blinding within each treatment group. It was assumed that the active comparator design would mitigate expectancy bias, but we cannot be confident that guessing of the trial-group assignment or biased expectations in favor of psilocybin did not influence the results. Although efforts were made to recruit patients by external referrals, most of the recruited volunteers referred themselves, and many expressed a preference for psilocybin over escitalopram. This created a selected trial population and limits generalization of the results The patients in the trial were not from diverse ethnic or socioeconomic backgrounds. Strategies to improve recruitment of more diverse study populations are needed in studies of psilocybin for depression. Also, average symptom severity scores at baseline were in the range for moderate depression, thus limiting extrapolations to patients with severe depressive symptoms or treatment-resistant depression Psychedelic agents have been shown to enhance suggestibility,23 and their psychological effects are assumed to be context-dependent.24,25 In other words, the content and subjective quality of the psychedelic experience is influenced by a person’s memories, perceptions, and degree to which the environment is supportive at the time of administration of the agent. In a study in which various psychedelic compounds were administered to rats, the compounds were shown to increase dendritic arbor complexity, promote dendritic spine growth, and stimulate synapse formation in the rat cortex, mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism,26 all of which are forms of neuronal plasticity that may be related to the principle that responses to psychedelics are especially dependent on contextual conditions This trial comparing psilocybin with escitalopram in a selected group of patients showed that the change in scores for depression at 6 weeks did not differ significantly between the trial groups. Secondary outcomes mostly favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the confidence intervals for the between-group differences were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are needed to compare psilocybin with established treatments for depression.",
51,10.1177/1455072517753339,"The purpose of this study was to explore how “ordinary” users of psychedelics approach psychedelic microdosing. The selection of users included in this study was not, however, representative of the population of psychedelics users, and the findings of the study therefore have no claim to general validity. Despite this shortcoming, the findings may serve to acquaint researchers with the, as of yet, understudied phenomenon of psychedelic microdosing The microdosing practices reported in this study generally conformed in regimen and dose to the recommendations published by Fadiman (2011), although some users experimented with daily microdoses. LSD and psilocybin-containing mushrooms were most commonly used, but some respondents also microdosed a wide range of lesser-known psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs. Respondents for the most part reported what they regarded as positive effects from microdosing, with few side effects. Microdoses most commonly served as mood and cognitive enhancers, allowing people to function at what they felt was a higher level than usual. There are clear parallels between psychedelic microdosing and the use of cognitive enhancement drugs among healthy individuals for performance improvements described by Corazza et al. (2014) and Hupli et al. (2016), as both forms of drug use can be motivated by a wish for enhanced performance in the workplace or in academic study However, there was also a therapeutic motivation for psychedelic microdosing among some of the respondents in this study who suffered from conditions such as anxiety or depression. These findings are congruent with reported effects from full doses of psychedelic drugs on conditions of depression and anxiety (Carhart-Harris & Nutt, 2010; Gasser et al., 2013; Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Johnstad, 2015; Ross et al., 2016). Reports about the efficacy of microdosing practices for conditions such as substance dependence, OCD, and PTSD also have parallels in research on therapeutic effects from psychedelics in full doses (Abramson, 1967; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2014; Krebs & Johansen, 2012; Nichols, 2004; Schenberg et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2013). It should be noted, however, that in the present study these observations were limited to one or a few individuals. Clinical research on microdosing should probably first look into putative anxiolytic and anti-depressive effects, but need not end there The lack of a clear distinction between therapy and enhancement that has been pointed to by anthropologists and sociologists who study enhancement technologies (Coveney et al., 2011; Hogle, 2005) is echoed in this study. Some respondents pointed to specific deficiencies that their use of psychedelic microdoses was intended to address, but there was an overlap between the use motivated by such therapeutic effects and the use motivated by an effect of enhancement. In either case, the desired effect from microdosing was to be lifted out of a state of relative limitation into a state of higher functioning. The difference was that in therapeutic use, the state of limitation corresponded with a specific medical diagnosis. One respondent explicitly challenged the notion that his “normal” or pre-microdosing state of being deserved the designation “healthy”, even though he had not been diagnosed with any specific ailment Some respondents experienced no effects from microdosing at all, however, and several others emphasised that, despite their positive experience, microdosing is no miracle cure. There were some indications that psychedelic microdoses might not retain their perceived beneficial effects over longer stretches of time, and that the use should therefore be constrained to phases, which was indeed the most common approach to microdosing among respondents with extensive experience. This reduction of effect over time might limit the medical value of microdosing psychedelics, and would seem to be an important area of investigation for subsequent clinical research of microdosing The most commonly reported challenges with microdosing were overdosing and insomnia. Overdosing in this case means going beyond microdose territory into a mini-dose that has some intoxicating effect. Such mini-doses are not by themselves overly problematic for experienced psychedelics users, but might have serious negative consequences for users who combine microdosing with work, driving a car, and other activities not compatible with drug intoxication. The overdosing problem applies both to LSD and to psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The former is fully active in doses of a hundred micrograms, and a microdose is often obtained, rather inexactly, by cutting a blotter into separate pieces. Mushrooms for their part may be subject to a natural variation in psilocybin content (Rätsch, 2005). Clinical applications of microdosing could solve this problem by supplying standardised microdoses, but would have to trust their clients not to take several doses at the same time The few negative reports about microdosing in this study were not apparently a result of overdosing, nor is there any other obvious explanation for their occurrence. While these negative experiences constitute a minority, it is important to note that some people may experience distinctly unpleasant effects as a result of microdosing. The reported “bad trip” might appear to be a product more of cannabis use than of the LSD microdose, but damage-reduction publications such as tripsafe.org often warn that cannabis might potentiate psychedelic drugs The question of whether microdosing of psychedelic drugs should be characterised as “abuse”, which was Corazza et al.’s (2014) label for piracetam use among healthy individuals, or as “functional drug use”, which Hupli et al. (2016) argued is the best way to understand the use of cognitive enhancement drugs, is not easily answered. Psychedelics are designated as drugs of abuse in most of the world, but there is a substantial research literature that indicates that their use may have therapeutic effect. It is possible that microdosing may allow users to procure some of the perceived positive effects of these drugs while avoiding the problems that may follow from taking them in full doses As a social phenomenon, we can perhaps understand psychedelic microdosing in light of Coveney et al.’s (2011) observation that the cultural authority of medical experts may be subject to change. Much medical knowledge is now readily available on the Internet, and electronic fora for psychedelic users serve as knowledge repositories that integrate shared user experiences with medical and neuroscientific information. This has resulted in increased knowledge availability (or at least in the perception of increased knowledge availability), which may have caused a corresponding decrease in the cultural authority of medical experts. The growth of microdosing may therefore reflect a social development in which ordinary people use the Internet for medical advice and feel empowered to take personal responsibility for their medication needs, pursuing therapy and enhancement through means that the medical establishment does not recognise and would perhaps frown upon There are no published studies on microdosing with which the findings of this study may be compared. The reports of therapy and enhancement, which constitute the majority here, conform to the findings of previously published anecdotal reports (Fadiman, 2011; Solon, 2016; Waldman, 2017), while the reports of no effect or negative effect are, as far as I can determine, without counterpart. This may reflect a bias towards beneficial effects in anecdotal reports, which Partridge et al. (2011) found to be a problem for media reports about enhancement drugs, or perhaps it may be that the method used in this study has been more conducive to obtaining balanced information There is no way to differentiate between drug effects and positive or negative expectation effects (placebo/nocebo) in these data, but the study affords an understanding of how “ordinary” users of psychedelics approach psychedelic microdosing. Several respondents expressed nuanced views about the relative benefits and disadvantages of microdosing that were not in any obvious manner indebted to placebo or nocebo effects. They also reported discovering specific practices that have worked well for them, compared to others that were found to be ineffectual or subject to negative side effects. Confidence in the reports is therefore increased by their high degree of specificity, as curative or symptom-abating effect was often reported only for one of several drugs that respondents used Another overall finding from this study is the value of tapping the psychedelic Internet community for academic studies. It is unknown whether this segment of Internet-active users is representative of the general psychedelic-using population, but the discussion fora frequented by these users are probably among the best recruitment arenas available to researchers. The respondents in this study were reflective, knowledgeable, and fully capable of expressing their views, and their participation would be an asset to any study of psychedelic drug use. It is possible, however, that a less erudite group of psychedelics users would have a less constructive and self-reflective approach to microdosing, and the study has nothing to say about the attractions of microdosing to women. The findings from this study should therefore be taken to reflect the microdosing experiences of a resourceful group of male psychedelic users, and have value primarily to the extent that they may provide subsequent investigations with research questions and hypotheses.",
52,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.09.012,"Eleven clinical trials were identified in which therapeutic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens were evaluated in patients with a life-threatening disease. Studies can be divided into three major subgroups: 1) initial trials which focused on analgesic effects of psychedelics, where psychological effects were merely considered as side effects, sometimes surprisingly associated with improved disease coping strategies and attitudes (Kast, 1967, Kast, 1966; Kast and Collins, 1964); 2) clinical trials conducted during the 1960s and 1970s, mostly at Spring Grove, where psychological effects of psychedelics were primarily focused in the framework of ‘Psychedelic (Peak) Therapy’ (PDT). In these studies, the classical variables of ‘set’ (referring to the patient's mind-set, history, health, personality, social and emotional situation), ‘setting’ (referring to the physical environment, study personnel, music selection and other stimulus during the session) and ‘substance’ (referring to type, dosage and frequency of the employed psychoactives) were carefully considered (Grof et al., 1973; Pahnke et al., 1969; Richards et al., 1980), and preparatory and post-treatment therapy sessions were understood as a vital part of the treatment process (Halifax and Grof, 1977; Kurland, 1985; Maslow, 1962; Sherwood et al., 1962). In the course of this close meshed patient care, fewer psychological adverse events such as panic reactions were described and up to two-thirds of the patients experienced reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy showed effective and promising results. 3) A third group includes recent clinical trials, carried out after a long hiatus period of legal restrictions (Gasser et al., 2014a, Gasser et al., 2014b; Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016), in which previous methods were reconsidered, aiming to induce insightful psychological experiences at somewhat lower dosages and with psilocybin being the predominant substance. These trials do not exhibit any fundamentally new conceptual framework, but they are of a substantially increased methodological quality (placebo control, randomization, double-blinding, use of modern psychiatric diagnostic classification and rating scales and long-term follow up). Mystical-type experiences have been repeatedly suggested as mechanisms of action, showing a conceptual proximity to the historical concept of ‘Psychedelic (Peak) Therapy’ (PDT) (Grof, 1980). However, PDT has been predominantly carried out in the US until the 1970s involving high dosages of psychedelics aiming to induce ‘peak experiences’. In contrast, in Europe, traditionally lower dosages have been employed in the framework of ‘Psycholytic Therapy’ (PLT), not necessarily aiming at inducing peak experiences (Majić et al., 2015). On the other hand, it has been reported that patients might have mystical experiences without profound impact on their lives and, vice versa, others might not have made these kind of experiences but still have profoundly benefitted from the treatment. Thus, we believe that mystical or peak experiences might be important, but there are other important factors as well that are responsible for the therapeutic effects of psychedelic-assisted therapy","From today's viewpoint, most of the studies before the year 2000 show strong methodological limitations. While early results were mainly based on anecdotal evidence, later results were based on non-standardized outcome criteria and were not compared with any control group. Additionally, no long-term follow-up studies of the patients were carried out. In regard to the open study design the trials carry a high risk of bias. Most studies also lack detailed methodical descriptions of the populations, diagnosis methods, psychotherapeutic interventions and statistical analysis Nevertheless, recent double-blind, randomized and controlled studies show some limitations in their study set-up. The blinding process is only possible to a limited extent since psychedelics produce unique characteristic psychoactive effects, which reveal the allocation in treatment or control group to patient and therapist (Gasser et al., 2014a; Grob et al., 2011; Mogar, 1967; Salzman and Hicks, 1969). Methods to counteract this phenomenon are the administration of the active placebo niacin or small dosages of the psychedelic compound but are only successful to a limited extent. Therefore, in combination with the subjective outcome measures based on clinician- and patient-administered rating scales, recent studies still carry a risk of bias. Furthermore, the obtained follow-up data are only conclusive to a limited extent, after control groups have also received an active therapeutic dose of the psychedelic compound within the applied cross-over design. The authors argued that the reason for the uncontrolled study design in the early studies and the cross-over design in more recent studies, were also because of ethical reasons, since it would be ethically questionable to withhold a potential beneficial treatment concept or to run a placebo control group over such a long period in regard to the patient's severe illness and reduced life expectancy (Gasser et al., 2014b; Grob et al., 2013, Grob et al., 2011). With regard to the generalizability of the results, the strict exclusion criteria (see below) under which the patients for the studies have been recruited constitute a restriction. Also, the high percentage of highly educated people in the population and the fact that around half of the patients reported a prior history of hallucinogen use in recent studies (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016), further limits the generalizability. In conclusion, there is some evidence that substance-assisted psychotherapy with serotonergic hallucinogens is effective in the treatment of mental health problems in patients with a life-threatening disease and is well tolerated. Moreover, there is some evidence that psychedelic-induced mystical-type peak experiences mediate not only reduction of psychiatric symptoms in these patients, but may also be helpful for these patients by improving disease coping and quality of life when facing a life-threatening condition. Given the reasonable safety profile of serotonergic hallucinogens in a controlled clinical environment, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy could be a promising treatment option in this context – especially for patients where other approaches have been ineffective. Hence, additional trials are needed to evaluate whether the presented results can be transferred in to clinical practice."
53,10.1177/0269881116628430,"This study sought to assess the effects of LSD on spontaneous mental time travel and relate this to the drug’s neurobiological effects. Results revealed a selective reduction in the number of linguistic references to mental time travel to the past under LSD. Moreover, there was a relationship between the general intensity of LSD’s subjective effects and the reduction in mental time travel to the past, further supporting the assumption that the effect was driven by LSD. Results provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of this effect, as decreased DMN integrity correlated with reduced mental time travel to the past Prior research links the DMN to autobiographical memory (Spreng et al., 2009) and self-reflection (Gusnard et al., 2001), as psychological functions relevant to the notion of the self or ego (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). This fits in with the present data on the correlation between decreased integrity within this particular brain network and reduced time travel to the past. The DMN appears to subserve spontaneous cognition and particularly cognition that has an introspective and itinerant (i.e. freely-wandering) quality (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010) Many brain networks receive a driving input from the external world (e.g. for the visual system this input is light activating cells in the retina) and therefore possess a relatively secure anchor point. The DMN, however, does not possess such an obvious anchor point. If an equivalent ‘driving input’ was to exist for the DMN, it would likely have an endogenous or intrinsic origin (e.g. a structure or system already within the brain) and be hierarchically inferior (e.g. evolutionarily older) to the cortical DMN. The DMN is known to possess strong anatomical and functional connections with the hippocampus, via the parahippocampal cortex (Ward et al., 2014). Hippocampal to cortical-DMN RSFC has been found to correlate with the prevalence of mental time travel (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010); moreover, given the classic association between the hippocampus and autobiographical memory (e.g. Fletcher et al., 1997), it seems logical to suspect that the hippocampal-DMN circuit is important, not just for autobiographical memory recollection, but for the preservation of the sense of self or ego. Support for this hypothesis is provided by evidence that the hippocampal-DMN circuit undergoes significant development during maturation (Supekar et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2015), and that the psychedelic, psilocybin, decreases parahippocampal to cortex RSFC in a manner that correlates with ego-dissolution (Lebedev et al., 2015). Further work is required to test and develop the hypothesis that the hippocampus-DMN circuit is important for the maintenance of one’s sense of self and its reliance on autobiographical information The present results may help to extend our knowledge of the psychological effects of LSD and could inspire a new perspective on the construct of ‘ego-dissolution’. Ego-dissolution is an abstract construct, yet it is generally considered to be an important feature of the psychedelic experience, especially at higher doses, and it is often described by users of psychedelics (Turton et al., 2014). Moreover, the phenomenology of psychedelic-induced ego-dissolution overlaps with the phenomenology of ego-disturbances in early psychosis (Lebedev et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2012; Schneider, 1959), as well as classic accounts of ‘self-loss’ in spontaneous religious, spiritual or mystical experiences (James and Bradley, 2012). However, although the experience of ego-dissolution is often described in relation to the psychedelic experience, it is not always clear what is meant by this. It has yet to be investigated if the experience of ego-dissolution under psychedelics is conceptually similar to ego-disturbances in psychosis: Self-disorder in psychosis focuses on a basic, minimal, or core self, also known as ipseity (Nelson et al., 2014; Zahavi, 2005). Further studies could compare phenomenological similarities and differences between the concept of ego disturbances and the concept of ego dissolution, using the linguistic tool presented in the current study. If similarities were to be observed, this would substantiate the LSD state as a model of psychosis (Carhart-Harris et al. 2015) The notion of ‘the narrative self’ and ‘narrative identity’ (Habermas and Bluck, 2000) may be particularly relevant to the findings of the present study and how they relate to psychedelic-induced ego-dissolution. The importance of accessing and rehearsing autobiographical information for the development of a narrative self has been well demonstrated (Pasupathi and Hoyt, 2009). Thus, the existence of a secure sense of self or ego may depend on a regular input or ‘feed’ from autobiographical memory into consciousness (Fivush and Nelson, 2006), and if this feed is suspended, then the self/ego may collapse (Turton et al., 2014). Based on prior findings (Lebedev et al., 2015), we speculate that the hippocampal-DMN circuit may be an important part of such a ‘feed’ The therapeutic potential of LSD for psychotherapy is currently being revisited (Gasser et al., 2014). LSD has a history of use as an adjunct to psychotherapy, and was originally thought to lower psychological defences and facilitate emotional insight and release, i.e. ‘catharsis’ (Cohen, 1967; Kaelen et al., 2015). The present finding of decreased mental time travel to the past under LSD may seem contradictory when one considers that a major rationale for using LSD in psychotherapy is that it can facilitate emotional insight, often via stimulating personal memories and associated affect (Cohen, 1967). Indeed, patients undergoing psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy often report re-experiencing past memories with an unusual vividness, an experience sometimes referred to as ‘reliving’ (Grof, 1979; Sandison, 1954) and facilitated recollection of positive episodic memories was demonstrated in a controlled experiment with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b) How can such improved access to autobiographical memory be reconciled with the present finding of less spontaneous reflections on the past under LSD? An explanation for this paradox may be found in the nature of the phenomena themselves, as well as how they are tested and measured. For example, spontaneous recollections or relivings that occur in early psychedelic-psychotherapy often relate to highly salient, personal themes, e.g. familial and/or intimate relationships and highly salient and/or traumatic events that may be temporally remote, e.g. sometimes dating back to childhood (Grof, 1979; Sandison, 1954), such as the following Standing about 4 yards away was my father with his fishing rod…. The sun was shining and the whole scene was peaceful and lovely… all the rest of the day and ever since that picture has remained with me as something too precious to part with because my father has died just before my illness. That is three years this year, and owing to his illness we hadn’t fished for some two years…. (Sandison et al., 1954: 497 Yet the kind of comments coded as reflections on the past in the present study appear to be less emotionally potent and are typically more recent: ‘Thinking about… random stuff which happened in the last few days’ (Placebo example, Table 1). Thus, during normal waking consciousness, mental time travel to the past may occur with greater regularly than in the psychedelic state; however, the content of these reflections may be more anodyne and (ego) syntonic or unthreatening. Moreover, it should be acknowledged that psychedelic-psychotherapy occurs in a relatively distinctive context, i.e. a patient with mental health problems receives treatment with a psychotherapeutic focus. Further work is required to investigate whether the present findings in healthy volunteers can be replicated in a patient population in a therapeutic context Where facilitated autobiographical memory recollection has been demonstrated in controlled research with a psychedelic (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b), participants were explicitly cued to recollect positive episodic memories. This is quite a different procedure to coding natural speech for spontaneous reflections on the past, present and future, and thus, the outcomes derived from these two different approaches cannot be easily compared. One should also consider that individuals demonstrate hypersuggestibility under psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015), and thus, reports of psychedelic-enhanced autobiographical memory recollection in controlled studies (where hypotheses may be easy to intuit) may be biased or, at least confounded, by enhanced suggestibility (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015). Measures of spontaneous cognition (as were employed here) may be particularly useful and informative in this regard, since the experimental aims and hypotheses motivating these measures are effectively hidden The raters using the tool of quantitative linguistic analysis in this study evaluated it as easy to apply, and indeed the inter-rater reliability was very high. This tool has been used effectively in previous studies to differentiate between (altered) states of consciousness (e.g. in sleep and waking states, and under electrostimulation; Speth and Speth, unpublished, 2016; Speth et al., 2015) as well as here with LSD. This helps to develop its utility as a means to quantify markers of different states of consciousness Mentation reports produced post-LSD were longer and more elaborate than those given post-placebo. This ties in with findings from other studies of altered states of consciousness, and especially dream research: mentation reports conceived after forced awakenings from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are known to be longer than reports conceived after non-REM sleep or sleep onset (Stickgold et al., 2001). This was one of the reasons why REM dreams have been interpreted as emotionally richer and more vivid. Their hallucinatory quality has been compared to acute states of psychosis (Hobson, 1997, 2004), as has the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris, 2007, Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). It is thus not surprising that a (hallucinatory) psychedelic waking experience likewise results in longer reports than a normal relaxed waking experience. It could prove fruitful to consciousness research if the similarities and differences between spontaneously occurring hallucinatory states (e.g. REM dreaming or hypnagogic hallucinations) and pharmacologically induced hallucinatory states (e.g. after LSD or psilocybin) were further explored by applying quantitative linguistic analysis and related quantitative tools, ideally in physiology-monitored experimental settings and within-subject designs (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2014) It is important to highlight some limitations of the present study. One of these relates to the fact that participants were intoxicated on LSD when asked to deliver their retrospective accounts of their experience in the MRI scanner. This makes it difficult to determine whether the main effects reported here (i.e. reduced mental time travel to the past) are reflective of the acute intoxication state (which we assume) or the content of the participants’ descriptions about their experiences in the scanner, and so the nature of their retrospective thinking. Since the present analyses cannot make this differentiation, one way to address it in future studies might be to ask participants about their present state, e.g. with questions such as ‘How do you feel right now? There is also an important limitation which is related to the correlation analysis. It has been argued before that sample sizes in neuroimaging studies are commonly too small to yield reliable, replicable findings and that many reported positive outcomes may therefore be false positives (Button et al., 2013). It would be sensible to caution therefore that the present study’s sample size of n=15 (for the fMRI) may be too small to demonstrate a reliable relationship between individual differences in DMN connectivity and mental time travel and greater sample sizes are therefore advised for future studies Another important limitation of the present study’s findings must be considered. Namely, it could be inferred that the observed reduction in reflection on the past under LSD is not the result of a specific action of the drug on this specific measure but rather a product of a more general effect of LSD on cognition. If this interpretation were true, any intoxicant (i.e. not just LSD) that alters cognition in a profound way, might impact on mentation about the past. However, if this were true, then it might also apply to mentation about the future, but there was no effect of LSD on this measure. Moreover, the reduced mentation about the past was not caused by participants simply reporting less in their interviews on LSD; in fact, LSD interviews were significantly more elaborate and lengthy than the placebo ones (see Supplementary Material for a fuller discussion of this matter). This alternative explanation for the present results could be explored by examining the effects of other intoxicants, with quite different psychological effects to LSD (e.g. alcohol or amphetamine), on the same measures, to see whether consistent results are observed. Beyond pharmacological manipulations, the effects of other exhilarating experiences on the same measures might also be investigated. These important validity checks would inform on whether the effect of psychedelics on past-focused mentation is indeed exclusive to this class of drugs, or rather something more generally associated with intoxication and/or exhilarating experiences If the reported effect of LSD on past-focused reflection is relatively exclusive to psychedelics, then this may say something more interesting about them. The therapeutic potential of psychedelics is currently being revisited, with promising preliminary results (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Gasser et al., 2014; Grob et al., 2011; Osorio Fde et al., 2015). Inspired by the findings of neuroimaging research with psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014), our team are currently investigating the antidepressant potential of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression, and again, the initial results are very promising. fMRI studies with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a), ayahuasca (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015) and LSD (Carhart-Harris, 2015) have all shown decreased DMN RSFC, as have fMRI studies with meditation (Brewer et al., 2011; Farb et al., 2007; Hasenkamp et al., 2012), whereas DMN RSFC has been found to be elevated in depression (Greicius et al., 2007), and to correlate positively with ruminative thinking (Berman et al., 2011) The present analyses found a decrease in mental time travel to the past under LSD. Previous work has shown that daydreaming about the past is associated with low mood (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010) and popular treatments for depression, such as mindfulness-based psychotherapy, encourage patients to adopt a more present-focused style of thinking (Shapiro et al., 2006). It is intriguing to consider whether psychedelics work in a similar way to mindfulness-based therapies; promoting a mental state that is less focused on the past and therefore less unhappy (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010) – and there is some recent evidence to support this (Soler et al. 2016). It would be interesting to extend this work to enquire whether any mindfulness-promoting effects of psychedelics are be mediated by decreases in intra-DMN functional connectivity The present study has found decreased mentation on the past in conjunction with decreased DMN integrity under the acute effects of LSD; however, further work is now required to test whether the same effect can be observed after the acute effects of LSD have subsided. If the results of previous controlled studies with psychedelics (Griffiths et al., 2008), as well as subjective reports of participants from our own previous studies (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a) are considered, then such enduring effects seem likely Ever since [the psilocybin session on] Thursday, I’d say I have found it much easier to engage in the moment – to attend to the here and now. Whether this be watching water in a fountain, or sitting in science talks and meetings this morning. There were some fountains in Cardiff and the water was being blown by the wind, allowing the sun to highlight the spray. I could have watched it for ages – somehow the beauty was enhanced…. Whatever it was, it has lasted – like the sun shining through the leaves this morning, it made me slow down my walk to work and enjoy the experience of it flickering over my face.","In conclusion, the present study sought to investigate the effect of LSD on mental time travel to the past, present and future. Results revealed a selective effect of LSD on mental spaces linked to the past, i.e. there were significantly fewer cases of mental time travel to the past under LSD than placebo, and this effect correlated with the general intensity of LSD’s subjective effects. These outcomes shed light on the phenomenon of ego-dissolution and specifically a decomposition of the ‘narrative-self’ or ‘narrative identity’, which is strongly associated with autobiographical thought (Pasupathi and Hoyt, 2009). A specific hypothesis was tested that this phenomenon relates to decreased DMN integrity, and this was supported by the data. The findings were discussed in relation to potential therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs, with a particular focus on depression. Further research is required to investigate the robustness, reliability and specificity of the reported findings."
54,10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.020,"Major hurdles facing research with psychedelics include the burden that their Schedule 1 status incurs and a lack of mainstream funding, and we suspect these things are related. The Schedule 1 status of psychedelics led to vastly increased regulations on research, associated costs, and damaging stigma that likely deterred governmental agencies, other reputable funding bodies, and companies from backing the relevant research. Before LSD was banned, the US NIH funded over 130 studies exploring its clinical utility; however, since the ban, it has funded none and until a few years ago, no company was committed to manufacturing medical grade psychedelics and thus procurement of the required drugs for clinical trials was almost impossible (Nutt, 2015) Nowadays, both COMPASS Pathways and Usona are making psilocybin at scale with others starting. Natural plant-based products such as ayahuasca, peyote, and magic mushrooms are now legal in some South American countries and are becoming decriminalized in a few US cities. Moreover, magic mushrooms could be legalized in the US state of Oregon later this year. Magic truffles, which contain the same active compound, are legal in the Netherlands, and this loophole, combined with a growing interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, has led to fast-growing industry in Dutch truffle retreats. Some finance journalists have begun predicting a “shroom boom” to rival the “green rush” seen with medicinal cannabis (Raphael, 2018). This escalating recreational use presents an opportunity to collect “Big Data” for educational and harm-reduction purposes, and we have set-up an online platform for doing this, called psychedelicsurvey.com It is possible to make new 5-HT2A receptor agonist ligands that would, at the time of synthesis, be outside national or UN Conventions. However, based on recent examples, the risk of them becoming restricted would be very high. In the UK, the ultra-restrictive 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act makes all novel psychoactive compounds illegal, and some of the newer 5-HT2A receptor agonists (e.g., the NBOMeS) have been found to be more toxic than the older ones, a situation similar to that seen with the growth of legal but more harmful synthetic cannabinoids Overall, it seems the best way forward to fostering research and therapeutic application is to press for a rescheduling of psychedelics with proven therapeutic utility, especially psilocybin. That psilocybin was made Schedule 1 (i.e., having no medical value) on the shirt-tails of politically motivated banning of LSD has had an immense negative effect on treatment and research (Nutt, 2015). A campaign to re-schedule psilocybin is now underway in the UK, led by the charity DrugScience.org.uk and has international, scientific support","The resurrection of research into the neuroscience and therapeutic application of psychedelics represents one of the most important initiatives in psychiatry and brain science in recent decades. It rectifies decades of global research paralysis that emerged as collateral damage from the war on drugs and that has become one of the worst examples of censorship of human research in the history of science. The past ten years have seen the first green shoots of recovery with a number of teams across several continents beginning human neuroimaging and clinical trials that have delivered remarkable insights into brain function and instigated an exciting new approach to the treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders (Table 1). What is now needed is a combined, multi-level, multidisciplinary program of research into the mechanisms underpinning these findings."
55,10.1177/0269881117748902,"The present study sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin with psychological support on nature relatedness and authoritarianism in patients with TRD. Patients reported a greater connection with nature 1 week after treatment. This increase in nature relatedness was sustained at the 7–12-months follow-up. One week post-treatment a significant decrease in authoritarianism was also observed, and at the 7–12-month follow-up the decrease was at trend level. No significant differences in nature relatedness, authoritarianism or depressive symptoms were found in an age and education-matched group of control subjects measured over an equivalent time period, thus supporting the inference that the changes were not due to order effects. Taken together, these findings indicate that the psychologically supportive administration of psilocybin might induce sustained changes in attitudes and beliefs, including feeling closer to nature and less allied to authoritarian views The reduction of depressive symptoms following psilocybin treatment found here is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). Long-term improvements in psychological wellbeing (Griffiths et al., 2008) and trait openness and optimism (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; MacLean et al., 2011; Schmid and Liechti, 2017) have been observed in healthy volunteers following a single exposure to a psychedelic drug. A single dose of psilocybin has also been shown to induce enduring reductions in anxiety and depression as well as increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism in patients with anxiety reactive to advanced-stage cancer (Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016). Furthermore, rapid and sustained antidepressant effects were found in patients with recurrent MDD that were treated with a single dose of the plant-based psychedelic brew, ayahuasca (Osorio Fde et al., 2015) Evidence suggests that greater nature relatedness is associated with lower anxiety (Martyn and Brymer, 2014) and greater personal wellbeing (Capaldi et al., 2014; Cervinka et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2011; Mayer and Frantz, 2004; Mayer et al., 2008; Nisbet and Zelenski, 2011; Nisbet et al., 2011; Zelenski and Nisbet, 2014), and that exposure to awe-inspiring nature may increase pro-social behaviour (Piff et al., 2015) – perhaps through a related mechanism of seeing oneself as small in relation to the vastness of nature. Here, we show that the TRD patients felt more connected to nature up to 7–12 months after psilocybin treatment. This is consistent with a previous study in healthy participants in which 38% of the sample reported enduring positive changes in their relationship to nature and the environment 8–16 months post-psilocybin (Studerus et al., 2011). Psychedelic use in a large sample of web-survey respondents was found to positively predict nature relatedness (Nour et al., 2017); moreover, as with nature-inspiring experiences of awe (Piff et al., 2015), this relationship was strongest in people who experienced the greatest ego-dissolution during their most intense psychedelic experience (Nour et al., 2017) Psychedelic users have been found to rate themselves as more concerned with the environment than users of other illicit substances (Lerner and Lyvers, 2006; Nour et al., 2017). Interacting with nature has been shown to have cognitive and affective benefits in healthy individuals (Berman et al., 2008) and patients with MDD (Berman et al., 2012). Although we found no correlation between the changes in nature relatedness or authoritarianism and changes in depression in the patients, this may simply have been due to the small sample size (n=7), or it is possible that a measure of mental wellbeing may have been more sensitive to such a relationship than the presently used measure of depression. There is, however, evidence to suggest that nature exposure decreases rumination as well as activity in brain regions implicated in depression (Hamilton et al., 2015), namely the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC) and regions of the default mode network (DMN) (Bratman et al., 2015). Interestingly, the administration of psilocybin has also been shown to acutely decrease sgPFC and DMN blood flow and within-network functional integrity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2015) and to increase global connectivity in the brain (Petri et al., 2014; Roseman et al., 2016). Further work is required to test the hypotheses that a renewed sense of ‘connectedness’, including feeling connected to nature, is a key factor determining therapeutic outcomes in psychedelic therapy (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b) and to better elucidate its basis in the brain. A working hypothesis is that increased global connectivity in the brain and its relationship to ego-dissolution (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016) and associated ‘connectedness’ (Watts et al., 2017b) is a key mediating factor (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b) Psychedelic drug use in the 1960s and 1970s was strongly associated with anti-establishment and egalitarian counter-culture movements (Nichols, 2016), yet very little controlled research has investigated the link between psychedelic use and political perspectives. Here we show for the first time, in a controlled study, lasting changes in political values after exposure to a psychedelic drug. This is in line with early research showing that recreational LSD users score higher on attitudes of ‘personal liberty’ and ‘foreign policy liberalism’ than control subjects (McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971). Psychedelic users have also been shown to score higher on ‘concern for others’ and place lower value on ‘financial prosperity’ than non-users of illicit substances as well as users of amphetamine, cannabis or heroin (Lerner and Lyvers, 2006). Given that psychedelics act through the serotonin system, it is interesting that serotonin has been implicated in the assessment of harm in moral decision-making, altruistic punishment and fairness (Crockett et al., 2008, 2010, 2013; Story et al., 2015). Moreover, psychedelics have been shown to increase trait openness (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Griffiths et al., 2008; MacLean et al., 2011), and a substantial body of evidence demonstrates a positive association between openness and liberalism within individuals (Carney et al., 2008; Nour et al., 2017; Sibley et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013). Relatedly, the role of the serotonin 2A receptor, the key site of action of psychedelics, in mediating ‘conversion-type’ or ‘quantum change’ (Miller, 2004) experiences has recently been discussed (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) There are a number of important limitations to this study that must be considered when interpreting the results. The study formed part of an open-label clinical trial with a small sample size. The sample was smaller still for the NR-6 and PPQ-5, as these measures were introduced late in the trial due to inspiration from a separate project of ours (Nour et al., 2017). Also, although we recruited a control group to examine test–retest reliability on these measures, the controls were healthy subjects and were not exposed to the same treatment procedures. Critically, since treatment with psilocybin involved more than just drug administration (e.g. psychological support before and after the psilocybin dosing sessions), it is quite possible that drug-unrelated factors contributed to the changes in NR-6 and PPQ-5 scores observed here. The caring therapeutic model may have been one such factor. A large double-blind randomised control trial, ideally with an active control condition (to try and maintain the study blind), is required to more rigorously test the possible causal association between psilocybin and changes in nature relatedness and political perspective reported here. It would be hasty, therefore, to attempt any strong claims about a causal influence due specifically to psilocybin at this stage, and we should also be aware of anomalies in the relationship between psychedelic use and left-wing politics (Henrik, 2017); however, intriguing questions relating to psychedelics and political/philosophical perspectives remain A further limitation concerns the gender matching of control subjects and TRD patients; all TRD patients were male, whereas there were more females (71%) than males (29%) in the control condition. Thus, our findings in the TRD group cannot necessarily be extrapolated to females and the possibility of a gender effect cannot be discounted, and neither can we directly extrapolate the present findings to non-depressed populations The specificity of our main results also requires careful consideration. The question remains to be addressed whether the reported changes in nature relatedness and authoritarianism observed here post-treatment with psilocybin were selective for these outcomes, or rather an epiphenomenon of the treatment’s core effects on depressive symptoms. The question of causality is of central relevance here, and only further research can elucidate this. In this context, we would like to propose that there is a common mediating factor at play, driving both the improvements in mental health and changes in belief systems seen here – as well as elsewhere with psilocybin and other psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Hendricks et al., 2015b; Krebs and Johansen, 2013; MacLean et al., 2011). Such a common factor could be seen as a mental health equivalent of the general intelligence factor (e.g. Spearman’s g) in cognitive science (Spearman, 1987; Spiegelman, 2010). More specifically, in line with a recent commentary from our team (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b) we propose that connectedness is this factor (see Carhart-Harris et al. (2018b); Watts et al. (2017b)), and that psychedelics positively and potently modulate this Connectedness is a construct in need of development, but related concepts can be found in the literature (Alexander, 2010). In brief, connectedness can be defined as a sense of feeling connected to one’s self (i.e. a sense of feeling emotionally and somatically integrated and at peace) as well as others (e.g. one’s partner, family, friends, colleagues and community) and the world more generally (e.g. feeling connected to nature and a guiding ethical and/or philosophical principle), as described in our recent work (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b). Thus, a remediating effect on feelings of disconnectedness, characteristic of a broad swathe of mental illness (Alexander, 2010), may underlie both the improvements in depressive symptoms and the relevant changes in political perspective reported here What of the association between mental health and political perspective? There is some support for a link between lower authoritarianism and better mental health (Amodio et al., 2007; Hirsh et al., 2010; Jost et al., 2003), although there are also some contradictory findings (Verhulst et al., 2016; Vigil, 2010). The idea that drugs, including legal ones such as alcohol (Nour et al., 2016) and caffeine (Carpenter, 2015), and medications such as stimulants (Ohler and Whiteside, 2017) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Kramer, 1997) can modulate belief systems, including political perspective, is relatively new – but one that may be fundamentally important, with potentially profound implications. If, for example, it was found that excessive alcohol use promotes a detachment from nature (Nour et al., 2016), chronic stimulant use promotes an aggressive industriousness and hubris – and potential for paranoia (Ohler and Whiteside, 2017) – and psychedelic experiences promote a generalised sense of connectedness (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b), including greater altruism (Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017; Schmid and Liechti, 2017), what implications would this have for societies and their policies on such drugs? This and related topics may be seen as part of a new branch of political science, focused on the psychology and neurobiology of political perspective (Amodio et al., 2007; Everett et al., 2015; Haidt, 2013; Kanai et al., 2011; Kaplan et al., 2016; Nash et al., 2017) Finally, we are keen to avoid a value judgement about the political changes that may (or may not) be attributable to psychedelic use. For some, ecological considerations (e.g. captured by nature relatedness) may be assigned the greatest importance (Lovelock and Hudson, 2016), particularly when considering the scale and seriousness of the problem posed by climate change, for example (Prüss-Ustün et al., 2016), whereas others may recognise ‘order’ (e.g. captured in part by our authoritarianism scale) as an essential and functional counterweight to lawlessness (Bejan, 2017; Haidt, 2013). Testing whether psychedelic use is ‘beneficial for society’ would be a complex project, not least because opinions will differ on how to define ‘beneficial’ (although see Harris (2010) for a thought-provoking discussion on this matter). Even so, exploring the potential of psychedelics to moderate extremist views, and/or facilitate reconciliation, might be worth exploring, given the present results and wider supporting literature (Amodio et al., 2007; Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Hirsh et al., 2010; Jost et al., 2003; Watts et al., 2017a) In conclusion, this study sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin with psychological support on nature relatedness and authoritarian attitudes in patients with TRD. With significant caveats clearly highlighted, our findings tentatively raise the possibility that given in this way, psilocybin may produce sustained changes in outlook and political perspective, here in the direction of increased nature relatedness and decreased authoritarianism. These findings motivate further controlled studies to better determine the causality, reliability, specificity and durability of this relationship, as well as potential applications",
56,10.1177/0269881116652578,"The reviewed studies show that acute AYA administration to healthy volunteers in controlled settings produces significant subjective effects, peaking between 1.5 and 2 h and subsiding around 4 h later, involving perceptual modifications, enhanced introspection, intense emotional modifications, and increases in ratings of positive mood and activation (De Araujo et al., 2012; Dos Santos, 2013a; Dos Santos et al., 2011, 2012; Riba et al., 2001, 2003, 2006; Schenberg et al., 2015; Soler et al., 2015). These effects are similar to those described for other classic hallucinogens that act as 5-HT2A-receptor agonists, such as mescaline (Hermle et al., 1992; Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964), psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, 2012b; Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964; Kometer et al., 2012; Kraehenmann et al., 2015; Studerus et al., 2011; Vollenweider et al., 1997), LSD (Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964; Schmid et al., 2015), and DMT (Strassman et al., 1994) In the case of patients, AYA was administered only to volunteers with depression (Osório et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016) in two open-label trials and to patients with drug-related disorders in an observational study (Thomas et al., 2013). Acute AYA administration was associated with acute and subacute symptom improvement in all three studies, including fast-acting and enduring antidepressive effects (Osório et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016) and significant reductions in cocaine use (Thomas et al., 2013). Although participants reported positive and lasting changes from participating in these studies, these trials have several important limitations such as small sample sizes and absence of matched controls However, these preliminary data corroborate the results from non-controlled human studies reporting that regular AYA use is associated with remission of mood and anxiety disorders (Barbosa et al., 2009; Bouso et al., 2012; Da Silveira et al., 2005; Grob et al., 1996; Halpern et al., 2008) and drug abuse/dependence (Bouso et al., 2012; Fábregas et al., 2010; Fernández and Fábregas, 2014; Fernández et al., 2014; Grob et al., 1996; Halpern et al., 2008; Labate et al., 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Loizaga Pazzi, 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Verrer, 2014; Winkelman, 2014). These studies also corroborate the results from recent clinical trials describing antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects of psilocybin (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Grob et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2014; Moreno et al., 2006) and LSD (Gasser et al., 2014). Moreover, Oliveira-Lima et al. (2015) showed that AYA inhibited and prevented the onset and recurrence of alcohol-related behaviors in mice Liester and Prickett (2012) suggested four hypotheses to explain the mechanisms of AYA’s action in the cases of successful treatment of drug-related disorders, including (a) the biochemical perspective (i.e. AYA could inhibit dopamine levels in the mesolimbic pathway and reduce activity in the reward center, therefore it could reduce the effects of addictive drugs in this circuit), (b) the physiological perspective (i.e. reduced dopamine levels could interfere with the synaptic plasticity associated with dependence), (c) the psychological perspective (i.e. by helping to resolve traumas and to understand the potential outcomes of choices and by improving decision-making, since it enhances insights into personal concerns), and (d) the transcendental perspective (i.e. by facilitating transcendent experiences in a model similar to psychedelic therapy with LSD) It is necessary to emphasize that controlled trials have not been carried out to separate or distinguish these factors from each other and test them. Additionally, the subjective effects of AYA, as of other psychedelic substances, vary significantly among users. Thus, while AYA could be therapeutic to some people, it could be quite uncomfortable for others. However, animal studies with AYA and its alkaloids do show that these substances have antiaddictive (Aricioglu-Kartal et al., 2003; Brierley and Davidson, 2013; Glick et al., 1994; Liester and Prickett, 2012; Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015; Owaisat et al., 2012) and antidepressive (Fortunato et al., 2009, 2010; Pic-Taylor et al., 2015) potentials The neural correlates of the subjective and therapeutic effects of AYA and other hallucinogens such as psilocybin and LSD seem to involve agonism at 5-HT2A receptors expressed in frontal and paralimbic brain areas implicated in emotional processing, interoception, memory, and the sense of “self” (Alonso et al., 2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2014; De Araujo et al., 2012; Hermle et al., 1992; Kometer et al., 2012; Kraehenmann et al., 2015; Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015; Riba et al., 2006, 2004, 2006; Sanches et al., 2016; Schenberg et al., 2015; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Vollenweider et al., 1997). For instance, acute psilocybin administration was associated with enhanced autobiographical recollection (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b), increased positive mood and attenuated recognition of negative facial expression (Kometer et al., 2012), and reduced amygdala reactivity, which was correlated with increases in positive mood (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). Moreover, increased DMN activity is associated with rumination, and both AYA (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015) and psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a) reduce brain activity in key areas of the DMN, such as the posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, the fast-acting antidepressive effects of AYA were associated with increased blood perfusion in brain regions implicated in the regulation of mood and emotions, such as the left nucleus accumbens, right insula, and left subgenual area (Sanches et al., 2016) Agonism at cortical 5-HT2A receptors also seems to be involved in the cognitive effects induced by acute AYA intake, which was associated with impaired working memory (Bouso et al., 2013; Damásio, 2000), sustained attention (Bouso et al., 2013) and planning (Alonso et al., 2015), but also with improved inhibitory control (Damásio, 2000). Acute administration of psilocybin can induce several effects on cognitive processes including deficits in spatial working memory (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Wittmann et al., 2007), motion perception (Carter et al., 2004), visual-spatial attention (Carter et al., 2005a), context-dependent (Umbricht et al., 2003) and sensory information processing (Carter et al., 2005b), sustained attention (Hasler et al., 2004), and time perception and temporal control (Wittmann et al., 2007). Acute DMT administration may induce deficits in context-dependent (Heekeren et al., 2007) and sensory information processing (Heekeren et al., 2008) and in attentional processes (Daumann et al., 2008, 2010). Moreover, acute AYA intake may also produce deficits in context-dependent information processing (Frecska et al., 2004) Long-term AYA use was associated with structural alterations in medial parts of the brain, such as increased cortical thickness in the anterior cingulate cortex and decreased cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate cortex (Bouso et al., 2015) Furthermore, greater exposure to AYA was associated with a higher degree of thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, and greater scores on the Self-transcendence temperament dimension of the TCI-R, a personality trait measuring religiousness, transpersonal feelings, and spirituality, were associated with increased thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex. However, despite these structural differences there was no evidence of increased psychopathology or worse neuropsychological functioning among AYA users. In fact, results even suggest cognitive enhancement and increased religiousness and spirituality (Bouso et al., 2012, 2013, 2015) Previous studies in humans suggest that the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices are involved in the acute effects of AYA (De Araujo et al., 2012; Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015; Riba et al., 2004, 2006) and other hallucinogens (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012b; Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013; Studerus et al., 2011). The posterior cingulate cortex has a prominent role in the DMN, involved in internal mentation, the sense of “self”, mind-wandering, remembering, imaging, and planning; the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in cognitive functions such as attention and executive control (Alonso et al., 2015; Bouso et al., 2015; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2014; Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015). The structural alterations observed could be induced by activation of frontocortical glutamate networks secondary to 5-HT2A receptor agonism, leading to enhanced expression of transcription (egr-1, egr-2) and neurotrophic (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)) factors involved in synaptic plasticity and also to increases in the size of dendritic spines on cortical neurons, thus enhancing neuroplasticity and neurogenesis (Baumeister et al., 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Moreno et al., 2013; Ross, 2012; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010) In line with this hypothesis, Fortunato et al., (2009, 2010) reported that acute and chronic administration of harmine to rats induced antidepressive-like behaviors in experimental models of depression and also increases in BDNF levels in the rat hippocampus. Moreover, a recent study reported that AYA administration to female Wistar rats was associated with antidepressive-like behaviors and increased neuronal activation in serotoninergic brain areas (Pic-Taylor et al., 2015). Research with rats have also reported beneficial effects of B. caapi extracts and its alkaloids harmine and harmaline in preclinical models of Parkinson’s disease, an effect that seem to depend on increased levels of serotonin and dopamine secondary to MAO-A inhibition (Samoylenko et al., 2010; Schwarz et al., 2003). However, it is important to note that animal studies should not be uncritically generalized to humans, since there are important differences in the action and metabolism of AYA alkaloids among different species (Dos Santos, 2013a), and distinct definitions of depression Thus, taken together, the above studies suggest that enhanced neuroplasticity and neurogenesis could be involved in the antidepressive, anxiolytic and antiaddictive effects of AYA and other hallucinogens (Baumeister et al., 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Dos Santos et al., 2016; Fortunato et al., 2009, 2010; Moreno et al., 2013; Ross, 2012; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). Indeed, Bouso et al. (2015) even speculated that the cognitive enhancement observed in regular AYA users (Bouso et al., 2012, 2013, 2015) could be explained by the greater cortical thickness observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, involved in attention and executive control The above mentioned cognitive deficits resemble some of the symptoms of the acute phase of psychosis, and classic hallucinogens have been used as experimental models of psychosis (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013, 2014; Carter et al., 2004, 2005a, 2005b; Daumann et al., 2008, 2010; Frecska et al., 2004; Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008; González-Maeso and Seafon, 2009; Hasler et al., 2004; Heekeren et al., 2007, 2008; Hermle et al., 1992; Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964; Steeds et al., 2015; Umbricht et al., 2003; Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Vollenweider et al., 1997, 1998; Wittmann et al., 2007). Indeed, one of the major concerns associated with the ingestion of AYA and other hallucinogens is the possibility of suffering a prolonged psychotic reaction or disorder However, according to the reviewed studies there is no evidence that acute AYA administration in controlled settings is associated with prolonged psychotic reactions (Dos Santos, 2013a; Dos Santos et al., 2011, 2012; Osório et al., 2015; Riba et al., 2001, 2003; Sanches et al., 2016; Thomas et al., 2013). AYA was well tolerated by healthy volunteers and patients, producing few short-lived side-effects such as transient anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. No side-effects lasting beyond the acute effects of AYA were reported in the reviewed studies. With the exception of the significant emetic effects, which seem to be associated only with AYA, these results are in line with previous studies involving the administration of hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin and LSD to healthy volunteers and to patients with psychiatric disorders (Cohen, 1960; Cohen and Ditman, 1962; Frecska and Luna, 2006; Malleson, 1971; Smart and Bateman, 1967; Strassman, 1984; Studerus et al., 2011) Furthermore, despite the fact that nearly 20,000 people worldwide are members of some of the Brazilian AYA religions (Labate and Araújo, 2004; Labate and Cavnar, 2014; Labate et al., 2009), we are aware of only a few case reports describing adverse psychiatric reactions to AYA (Dos Santos and Strassman, 2008; Gable, 2007; Lima and Tófoli, 2011; Szmulewicz et al., 2015). Gable (2007) reported that over a five-year period in the UDV context there were 13 to 24 cases in which AYA intake was associated to an undefined psychotic incident. These cases were reported from a cumulative estimated 25,000 AYA sessions, thus representing a rate less than 0.1% (0.052–0.096%), which is comparable to the incidence of transient psychoses associated with LSD administration in controlled settings (Cohen, 1960) Dos Santos and Strassman (2008) reported the case of a young adult male who experienced two psychotic paranoid episodes (separated by one year) during and after participation in AYA rituals. He had no previous psychotic symptoms or a family history of psychosis, but he had consumed other hallucinogens (LSD and psilocybin) on several occasions and was a nearly-daily cannabis user for the preceding six years before the psychotic episodes. Moreover, he was participating in AYA rituals for about two years, sometimes using cannabis concurrently. During an AYA ritual he combined its use with cannabis and experienced paranoid and suicidal thoughts and superficially cut himself with a sharp-edged ceremonial item. Psychotic symptoms persisted for a few weeks and only resolved after treatment with risperidone (6 mg/day gradually reduced to 0.5 mg/day over one year). After risperidone treatment, he resumed participation in AYA rituals and again experienced paranoid and suicidal ideation, which also persisted for some weeks and responded well to risperidone. Although this case is associated with AYA intake, it is difficult to establish a direct causal relationship between AYA and the emergence of psychotic symptoms because of the concurrent use of cannabis. On the other hand, the patient had been using cannabis and other hallucinogens including AYA for years without significant adverse reactions, suggesting the he was adapted to these drugs. Thus, it is not clear why he suffered a psychotic reaction in that particular ritual A study conducted in the context of the UDV reported that from 1994–2007 the Psychiatric Monitoring System organized by the Medical-Scientific Department of this religious group reported the occurrence of 29 cases presenting psychotic features that were possibly associated with AYA use (Lima and Tófoli, 2011). However, further evaluation of the cases showed that in only 19 of them AYA seemed to be the main onset factor. But even in these cases, an analysis of pre-morbid personality factors revealed aspects or characteristics that could also be associated with the occurrence of a psychotic behavior (Lima and Tófoli, 2011). Szmulewicz et al. (2015) reported a case of an adult who developed a manic episode after AYA consumption. Importantly, the patient had a clinical history including a previous episode of hypomania, and his father had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder type I. Interestingly, no significant changes in the YMRS were observed after AYA administration to depressed patients (Osório et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2016). However, in these studies a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or a previous history of mania or hypomania induced by antidepressant or substance use were considered exclusion criteria. Thus, AYA may be contraindicated for patients with bipolar disorders Taken together, these results suggest that the incidence of adverse psychiatric reactions among AYA users is rare, and its causal relation with AYA is sometimes difficult to establish. Moreover, admixture plants with chemical compounds that may induce psychotic-like reactions, such as the anticholinergic deliriant scopolamine, present in Brugmansia varieties sometimes used in mestizo and indigenous contexts, should be looked for in cases of reported psychotic outcomes (Gable, 2007; Dos Santos, 2013b). Furthermore, some of the Santo Daime churches may use cannabis as a sacrament in their rituals, especially in Europe, where the laws regarding cannabis use are more permissive (in Brazil, it is officially forbidden to use cannabis within the Santo Daime rituals since the 1980s because cannabis is illegal in this country) (Dos Santos, 2011; Groisman, 2000; MacRae, 1998). While there is little known about this, the careful examination of the effects of concomitant cannabis use during AYA sessions should be the subject of clinical research efforts in the future The reviewed studies also suggest that long-term AYA use by adults and adolescents is not associated with psychiatric disorders or neuropsychological deficits (Barbosa et al., 2009; Bouso et al., 2012, 2015; Da Silveira et al., 2005; Doering-Silveira et al., 2005a; Fábregas et al., 2010; Grob et al., 1996; Halpern et al., 2008). In fact, the reviewed studies suggested that continuous AYA use was associated with remission of psychiatric disorders such as drug abuse/dependence and mood and anxiety disorders (Barbosa et al., 2009; Bouso et al., 2012; Da Silveira et al., 2005; Fábregas et al., 2010; Grob et al., 1996). Moreover, adolescents raised within the syncretic church UDV were significantly less likely to engage in last year and last month self-administration of alcohol compared to the non-AYA exposed control subjects (Doering-Silveira et al., 2005b), and regular AYA use by adults was associated with changes in personality traits and in life attitudes and views, characterized by reduced impulsivity and shyness and increased independence, confidence, gregariousness, optimism, religiousness, transpersonal feelings and spirituality (Barbosa et al., 2009; Bouso et al., 2012, 2015; Grob et al., 1996). However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since it is difficult to differentiate whether the improvements described are a consequence of AYA ingestion or of participating in a religious group, which can improve quality of life and well-being (Panzini et al., 2007) These results are line with a previous study that assessed the psychological health and cognitive functioning of a group of 61 Navajo Native Americans members of the Native American Church, who regularly ingested the mescaline-rich cactus peyote (Halpern et al., 2005). Long-term peyote ingestion was not significantly associated with deficits on the Rand Mental Health Inventory (RMHI) and on 10 neuropsychological tests of memory and attentional/executive functions. Furthermore, the above results suggesting reduced anxiety and impulsivity associated with AYA ingestion are in agreement with a case report that described the use of AYA to reduce violent behavior (Frecska, 2008) Among the reviewed studies, there is an absence of research in humans to evaluate the effects of AYA in pregnant women and in children, although this population can also take part in the AYA rituals (Dos Santos, 2010, 2013; Labate, 2011). Although they are usually exposed to smaller doses and to less frequent participation, children of all ages participate in the rituals (Dos Santos, 2010, 2013; Labate, 2011). It is known that the period from birth to early adolescence is characterized by major restructuring of brain anatomical and functional characters by neuronal pruning, that will define which connections will be maintained and reinforced and which will be eliminated (Schafer et al, 2012) Neuronal adverse events that occur in this period, such as trauma and exposure to toxic substances, may have an impact on future cognitive functioning (Gogtay et al., 2004). Although neurodevelopmental studies reported that animals exposed to intrauterine AYA showed some anatomical alterations such as dilated brain lateral ventricles, these effects were observed only when the dose used was 10 times greater than the usual ritualistic dose (Oliveira et al., 2010). Moreover, as pointed above, it is important not to uncritically generalize animal data to humans (Dos Santos, 2010, 2013). Since some AYA users are exposed to the brew from intrauterine life and during the formation of the neural tube, it would be important to carry out research with the child population of AYA users for risk assessment Finally, more research is needed regarding the possible pharmacological interactions resulting from the combination of AYA alkaloids (especially the β-carbolines) with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and monoaminergic and serotoninergic substances like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tryptophan or antidepressives in general, since these combinations could potentially produce the serotonin syndrome (Callaway and Grob, 1998; Dos Santos et al., 2013a, 2013b)","Neuropsychological studies have demonstrated impaired performance of working memory in AYA users under the influence of the substance and better performance in other executive functions such as planning and inhibitory control (after acute and long-term AYA intake) in experienced users compared to occasional users and non-users. Research with neuroimaging showed the activation of frontal and paralimbic brain regions. The controlled/ritualistic use of AYA has a good safety profile, and recent research has suggested that AYA can have therapeutic effects on the remission of some psychiatric disorders such as major depression and substance dependence However, these preliminary studies were not controlled and the long-term effects of AYA, as well as the mechanisms of action responsible for these effects, are still largely unknown and therefore need to be further clarified. Thus, the lack of studies highlights important gaps, such as the aforementioned lack of research with children and pregnant women who drink the tea. Another factor which indicates the need for more research is the lack of studies with populations that have health problems, considering that the tests carried out had exclusion criteria for psychiatric and other diseases. Furthermore, more studies assessing the effects of AYA in naïve users are needed considering that most studies conducted so far assessed experienced AYA consumers, which may limit the generalizability of the results since these individuals are well adapted to long-term AYA use Therefore, more research is necessary to better understand the effects of AYA and its therapeutic potentials, avoiding the reckless spread of information devoid of scientific basis, which may interfere with the conduct adopted in clinical practice (Dos Santos et al., 2013b, 2016)."
57,10.1016/j.nicl.2015.08.009,"In this study, we analyzed the fMRI data of our previous psilocybin study (Kraehenmann et al., 2014) using DCM, an established framework enabling tests of directed (effective) connectivity. We were interested whether psilocybin modulated effective connectivity within a network implicated in threat processing during an amygdala reactivity task. In particular, our aim was to differentiate between psilocybin-effects on bottom-up, top-down, and bidirectional connectivity during threat-processing within a visual–limbic–prefrontal network. There were two main findings from our study: Firstly, both placebo and psilocybin data were best explained by a model in which threat affect modulated bidirectional connections between V1, AMG, and LPFC. Secondly, psilocybin – compared to placebo – substantially reduced the modulatory effect of threat on the top-down connection from the AMG to V1. This implies that psilocybin attenuates amygdala-dependent top-down tuning of visual regions during threat processing Our BMS finding that the full model, which is characterized by bidirectional modulatory effects of threat on visual–limbic–prefrontal connectivity, outperformed both the bottom-up and the top-down model, is in line with previous DCM studies (Herrington et al., 2011; Goulden et al., 2012). In these studies, BMS consistently favored models, which implement modulatory effects on both bottom-up and top-down connections during negative emotion processing. The winning model in our study contained reciprocal connections between V1 and AMG (V1 ↔ AMG) and between AMG and LPFC (AMG ↔ LPFC). Both V1 ↔ AMG and AMG ↔ LPFC reciprocal connections are critically involved in negative-emotion processing (Herrington et al., 2011; Goulden et al., 2012). In fact, it has been shown that visual threat perception may be enhanced through a re-entry mechanism of feed-forward connections from V1 to AMG and feedback connections from the AMG to V1 (Herrington et al., 2011). Furthermore, visual threat perception may be increased through feed-forward connections from the AMG to LPFC (Lu et al., 2012) and attenuated through inhibitory feedback connections from the LPFC to AMG (Volman et al., 2013). Although BMS did not directly compare model fits from different datasets (e.g. placebo, psilocybin), our model selection results indicate a consistent mode of visual threat processing during placebo and psilocybin treatments; namely, via modulation of both bottom-up and top-down connectivity across the visual–limbic–prefrontal hierarchy Our main finding was that psilocybin (compared to placebo) reduced the modulatory effect of visual threat on the top-down connection from the AMG to V1. In both humans and animals, visual threat poses a strong salience signal, which needs to be processed efficiently and therefore binds attentional resources (Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010). The “tuning” of visual regions via feedback projections from the AMG during threat processing is an important mechanism underlying visual threat processing and may enhance perception of visual threat signals (Morris et al., 1998). In addition, the AMG has been closely linked to salience processing and may, via top-down predictive signals, guide bottom-up information processing (Vuilleumier, 2015). Therefore, the amygdala may actually determine the affective meaning of visual percepts by its effects on sensory pathways — an effect which mainly occurs subconsciously and which may be greatly amplified in psychopathological conditions, such as anxiety disorders or depression. In this context, increased AMG reactivity may lead to an increased attentional focus on negatively valenced environmental or social stimuli and thus effectively blocks out the processing of positive information (Disner et al., 2011). This is especially relevant for hallucinogenic drugs such as psilocybin, because there has been a close and psychotherapeutically interesting relationship between visual perception and affective processes during hallucinogen-induced states (Leuner, 1981). The psilocybin-induced attenuation of top-down threat signaling from the amygdala to visual cortex may therefore lead to decreased threat sensitivity in the visual cortex. This mechanism may crucially underlie the previously observed decrease of behavioral and electrophysiological responses in the visual cortex to threat stimuli during psilocybin administration (Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Schmidt et al., 2013a) and may explain the psilocybin-induced shifts away from negative towards positive valence during emotion processing (Kometer et al., 2012). In line with the notion that attenuation of the top-down connection from the AMG to visual cortex may reduce threat processing, a recent study showed that habituation to visual threat stimuli may parallel attenuation of top-down connectivity from the AMG to visual cortex (Herrington et al., 2011). In addition, it has been found that hyper-connectivity between the AMG and visual cortex may underlie increased threat processing and anxiety (Frick et al., 2013) Given the relevance of LPFC in regulating AMG activity during threat processing, and given previous studies showing that serotonergic stimulation may increase inhibitory top-down connectivity from LPFC to AMG (Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010; Volman et al., 2013), we hypothesized that psilocybin-induced reduction in AMY activity might be due to an increased LPFC → AMG top-down connectivity during threat processing. However, psilocybin did not appear to increase top-down connectivity from LPFC to AMG in the current analysis. Two reasons might account for this First, the source of the psilocybin-induced reduction of AMG activity, as observed in our previous GLM analysis (Kraehenmann et al., 2014), might not reflect an increased top-down effect from LPFC, but rather a suppression of recurrent interactions with visual areas mediated by a reduced top-down connectivity with the visual cortex. The synaptic basis of this reduced top-down modulation might reflect a direct effect of psilocybin in the amygdala: amygdala neurons abundantly express 5-HT2A receptors, and DOI and other 5-HT2A agonists produce direct effects in the amygdala (Rainnie, 1999). In addition, a directly decreased AMG reactivity would result in a reduced load on the LPFC to regulate AMG activation. This view is supported by a recent DCM study showing that increased AMG-related load on the PFC yields subsequent responses in the PFC to regulate the AMG (Volman et al., 2013). Second, the AMG might be regulated by prefrontal cortical regions other than the LPFC, such as the medial PFC (MPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), or the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which have also been related to the ‘aversive amplification’ circuit (Robinson et al., 2013). For example, Sladky et al. (2015) recently analyzed the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (S)-citalopram on amygdala–OFC effective connectivity in healthy volunteers. They found that the OFC exhibited a down-regulatory effect on amygdala activation, and that this effect was significantly increased by the antidepressant (S)-citalopram. Although Sladky et al. used a similar threat-inducing amygdala reactivity task (Hariri et al., 2002) and likewise tested the effects in healthy volunteers, their study procedures differ substantially from our study, both in terms of task design (e.g. face stimuli instead of pictures, scrambled control stimuli, longer baseline conditions) and in terms of drug administration (e.g. chronic and repeated instead of acute and single treatment). Therefore, it is not easy to disambiguate task- from drug-specific effects in terms of PFC involvement and our DCM might have missed top-down effects from PFC on the AMG. However, given the cognitive task requirements in our task – where subjects were not explicitly required to evaluate or regulate their emotional responses to the threat stimuli – and given that the GLM analyses (Kraehenmann et al., 2014) did not show significant BOLD responses in the MPFC, ACC, or OFC, one might argue that top-down effects from other prefrontal regions are unlikely. Overall, both the hallucinogen psilocybin and the non-hallucinogen (S)-citalopram may normalize amygdala hyper-reactivity to threat-related stimuli; leading to their antidepressant and anxiolytic efficacy, but psilocybin appears to regulate emotion processing and mood by acting on network interactions which are different from classical antidepressants such as (S)-citalopram, such as the affective regulation of visual information processing shown here","This effective connectivity study shows that a decrease of top-down connectivity from the AMG to the visual cortex underlies the psilocybin effect on visual threat processing. This result suggests that decreased threat sensitivity in the visual cortex during emotion processing may explain the potential of psilocybin to acutely shift emotional biases away from negative towards positive valence: the capacity of the visual cortex to process multiple stimuli is limited and hence top-down suppression of negative stimuli enhances the processing of positive stimuli (Kastner et al., 1998). This may have important therapeutic implications for mood and anxiety disorders, where over-loading with negative stimuli and persistence of negative cognitive biases is a central feature (Disner et al., 2011). In post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, psilocybin might help inhibit fear-responses during exposure-based psychotherapy, which might facilitate therapeutic progress."
58,10.1177/0269881119855974,"Here we sought to devise and carry out validation work on a new scale intended to describe an important and hitherto under-quantified component of the psychedelic experience, the EB. We anticipate that this scale will serve as a useful ‘state’ predictor of the longer-term psychological outcomes after a psychedelic experience – supplementing already existing state predictor measures such as the MEQ and CEQ. We call this new scale the ‘EBI’. Results revealed that (as measured by the EBI) emotional breakthrough is dose dependent and sufficiently different from the mystical-type and challenging experience as indexed by the MEQ and CEQ respectively. Consistent with a major prior hypothesis, we found that (like the MEQ) the EBI significantly predicts post-psychedelic changes in well-being (greater EB, greater increases in well-being) and we also discovered that the EBI does not render either the CEQ or MEQ redundant but rather a multi-factorial predictor model that combines all three measures performs better than any alternative that neglects any one of them. The combined EBI, MEQ and CEQ model is able to predict close to 20% of the variance in well-being changes after a psychedelic experience, a not inconsiderable amount given the relatively ‘well’ nature of this sample and uncontrolled study design. We also found that both therapeutic intention and therapeutic setting can predict the intensity of EB, suggesting that, as with other components of the acute psychedelic experience, EB is highly influenced by the context in which the psychedelic is taken (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017b; Hartogsohn, 2016, 2017). Taken together, these results support the addition of the EBI to the arsenal of tools used to quantitatively describe the psychedelic experience and predict its longer-term psychological effects Modern phenomenological analyses (Belser et al., 2017; Gasser et al., 2014; Watts et al., 2017) and therapists’ accounts (Bonny and Pahnke, 1972; Cohen, 1959; Crocket et al., 1963; Eisner and Cohen, 1958; Fisher, 2015; Grof et al., 1980; Jensen, 1963; Katzenelbogen and Fang, 1953; Leuner, 1961; Martin, 1957; Richards, 2015; Sandison, 1955) have tended to recognise the importance of EB within the context of psychedelic experiences and psychedelic therapy; however, a validated quantitative measure of this phenomenon is arguably overdue and there is a significant contemporary need for it. Perhaps due to the relative dearth of psychedelic research since the 1960s and a particular bias common among those few research teams working within the current resurgent era, contemporary researchers have tended to place significant emphasis on the mystical-type experience, in part due to well-replicated findings that its occurrence is predictive of relevant psychological outcomes, such as improvements in well-being (Haijen et al., 2018) changes in personality (MacLean et al., 2011), and improvements in clinical outcomes in patient populations (Roseman et al., 2017) The present work has demonstrated the added value of measuring EB for predicting subsequent psychological outcomes after a psychedelic experience. However, are there other ‘state’ and perhaps ‘contextual’ factors that are also important determinants of longer-term responses to psychedelics – and might there be alternative dependent variables that are differentially influenced by state and contextual predictors? Indeed, these variables may also interact in non-linear ways. We have previously emphasised (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017b), and sought to measure and demonstrate, the influence of contextual factors such as the presence of others, associated therapeutic alliance, a therapeutic intention and setting and a willingness to surrender or ‘let-go’ to the psychedelic experience on longer-term psychological outcomes, and found them to be important (Haijen et al., 2018). Like ‘state’ predictors of long-term responses, it is logical to see these factors as mediators of the relevant changes, as they are temporal antecedents of them. Other factors we predict may be important for influencing long-term changes include psychological insight and psychological integration. Insight is a phenomenon that may occur acutely in a state-like fashion (like EB) but could only be more protracted, crystallising in the days to weeks following a psychedelic experience. Integration is another protracted phenomenon that may have no clear end-point as such Much more work is needed to understand the neurobiology of the entire psychedelic psychotherapy process and this will naturally require brain imaging at various time points: before, during and after a specific psychedelic experience. Further discussion of this topic is beyond the remit of the present article, only to say that there is some evidence that the magnitude of increased brain entropy, a known biomarker of the psychedelic state, has been found to be predictive of subsequent psychological changes (increased trait ‘openness’) over a consistent time-scale as was measured here in relation to well-being (Lebedev et al., 2016) Finally, we advocate looking at other dependent variables than just well-being. Well-being is a useful index of mental health in general populations (Tennant et al., 2007) but it may be that certain psychiatric disorders and/or symptom clusters behave differently in their relation to predictor variables. This is something we intend to investigate more fully in future analyses plus new and on-going studies Our novel analysis is part of an effort to elucidate the importance of the psychological mechanism of psychedelics alongside their pharmacological uses, and by doing so to emphasise the importance of the context in which these drugs are taken. That is to say that affirming that the experience mediates the clinical outcomes, means that the regular clinical context will have to be modified to accommodate psychedelics as an effective psychopharmacological intervention within psychiatry. On that note, there is a lesson from history we would like to bring to readers’ attention before closing: psychedelic therapy was once a relatively widely practised intervention in Western psychiatry before opinion shifted against it (Baum, 2016; Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979). As the pharmacological revolution in psychiatry gathered momentum in the 1960s and the thalidomide scandal occurred at a related time, regulations on experimental medicines tightened, as did the methods for assessing their safety and efficacy (Oram, 2012). Within this climate, some efforts were made to extricate the basic pharmacological action of LSD from the psychotherapeutic manner in which it was typically administered, e.g. by giving the drug in a psychologically ‘sterile’ environment (Ludwig, 1985). In at least one published study, patients treated with LSD were placed in a belt that restrained them to their bed (Johnson et al. 1969).Unsurprisingly, such efforts to ‘neutralise’ context (which is, of course, a misnomer) tended to reveal that LSD without contextual support does not nearly have the same therapeutic value and safety profile as LSD given with therapeutic support (Oram, 2012, 2014). These results, combined with the spread of unfounded but nonetheless affecting misinformation about LSD (Dishotsky et al., 1971) plus a tightening of legislation on drugs of potential misuse, best exemplified by the 1970 Controlled Substances Act (1970), signalled the demise of psychedelic psychotherapy. The present study’s analyses confirm the findings of other analyses (Dimascio and Klerman, 1960; Haijen et al., 2018; Hyde, 1960; Lasagna, 1963; Leary et al., 1963; Studerus et al., 2012) that context is an essential component of the psychedelic model (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017b; Hartogsohn, 2017; Leary et al., 1963) and that if one wishes to promote a positive therapeutic response to a psychedelic, then heeding and optimising the role of certain contextual components is entirely necessary, whereas neglecting them is bad practice if not unethical. Our hope is that psychedelic therapy of the future can be done in a way and a context that encourages and allows the free release of emotion, e.g. using tools such as music (Barrett et al., 2018; Bonny and Pahnke, 1972; Kaelen et al., 2017), empathic listening and purposefully designed supportive environments, even if this presents a significant challenge to the conventions of mainstream medicine [Practicing psychedelic therapy here] has transformed the entire hospital, because the whole atmosphere engendered by LSD has spread throughout the hospital and, in fact, forms an essential part of the hospital culture. If LSD is given in a large institutional setting, treatment will be ineffective unless this transformation has occurred British psychiatrist Ronald Sandinson (1916–2010) cited in Abramson (1960: 15) Three limitations of the present study should be noted. First, the present study’s population contained mostly healthy experienced psychedelic users, and therefore the results do not necessarily apply to clinical population (Haijen et al., 2018). In these users the outcomes in well-being might be related to the expectation build around psychedelic use in the psychedelic culture and literature. Furthermore the pharmacological mechanism of psychedelics might be different in these users due to greater exposure to this class of drugs. To improve translational relevance, future studies should use the EBI in clinical populations to assess its ability to predict changes in clinically recognised phenomena, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. The prediction model of changes in well-being predicted only 20% of the variance. However, we do expect this model to perform better in a clinical trial and in a controlled environment. Second, the study has relied on self-reports of drugs, doses and timing, which are not as accurate as in laboratory studies. Psychedelics that are sold in the market are unreliable in many cases and one cannot be sure which drug and what dose was used. Third, there was limited analysis of convergent validity. Although there is clearly some overlap with the MEQ, we are not aware of any other questionnaires that measure a construct closely related to EBI. One way to address this in the future might be to compare EBI scores with quantitative outcomes from qualitative interviews, to assess whether there is some correspondence. A better demonstration of the convergent validity of the EBI will serve to further strengthen its construct validity (Campbell and Fiske, 1959) In conclusion, EB is an essential component of psychedelic-assisted therapy, and therefore should be measured in future experimental medicine studies and clinical trials with psychedelics, alongside measures of peak and challenging experiences. Quantifying the psychological mechanism of psychedelic-assisted therapy is essential as psychedelic-assisted therapy is rightly both a pharmacological and psychological intervention. The predictive value of peak experiences is well-established within this context, and now the importance of EBs can be better researched and potentially supported as well. Furthermore, based on qualitative studies (Belser et al., 2017; Gasser et al., 2014; Watts et al., 2017) and a broader awareness of the phenomenology of the psychedelic experience, we believe there is scope for additional quantitative measures (e.g. of psychological insight) to be developed, so that a fuller understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanism of psychedelic (mind-revealing) therapy can be appreciated and utilised for positive ends",
59,10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00134,"Because we were interested in assessing the effects of a hallucinogenic dose of DMT on rodent behaviors, we chose to use a 10 mg/kg dose of DMT for all of our studies. This dose, when converted to a human equivalent dose using allometric scaling,37 is expected to be hallucinogenic based on the pioneering human studies conducted by Strassman and coworkers.38 Furthermore, a preponderance of evidence from rodent drug discrimination studies using DMT and related compounds suggested that a 10 mg/kg dose would reliably produce effects characteristic of hallucinogens.39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47 Immediately following administration of an intraperitoneal dose of DMT (10 mg/kg), rats displayed flat body posture and hind limb abduction in their home cages (Figure S1), which is indicative of acute serotonin syndrome.48,49,50,51 We did not observe any head-twitches or wet-dog shakes. After 30 minutes, DMT-treated rats began to engage in normal behaviors, and by one hour post-administration, they were qualitatively indistinguishable from vehicletreated control animals. In order to specifically avoid any confounding effects from initial DMT-induced serotonin syndrome, all subsequent behavioral tests were conducted 1 h following DMT administration. DMT has a half-life of 5–15 min in rats following intraperitoneal injection52 and is rapidly metabolized and cleared from brain, liver, and plasma within 1 h.53 This ensured that any behavioral effects observed would be due to persistent changes and not simply from the acute effects of the drug. Animals were tested in both novelty-induced locomotion (NIL) and elevated plus maze (EPM) paradigms to assess the effects of compound on anxiety (Figure 2). When exposed to a novel open space, DMT-treated animals displayed reduced exploratory behavior and traveled a significantly shorter total distance (Figure 2b and 2c) than vehicle-treated controls, but the drug did not affect thigmotaxis (Figure 2d). Both the number of rearings and time spent rearing were significantly reduced by DMT (Figure 2e and 2f). Furthermore, the drug reduced the time spent engaging in stereotypies but not the total number, suggesting that each event occurred for a shorter period of time (Figure 2g and 2h). Taken together, an acute dose of DMT can have anxiogenic effects even after the drug has been cleared from the body.52 To corroborate these findings, we next assessed the effects of DMT on EPM behavior. DMTtreated animals spent a decreased percentage of time in the open arms of the maze (Figure 2i) and had a fewer number of open arm entries (Figure 2j). The total distance traveled in the maze (Figure 2k) and the average velocity of the rodents (Figure 2l) were not statistically different between DMT-treated and vehicle-treated groups. The number of closed arm entries was also not statistically different between the treatment groups (Mean ± SEM; VEH = 9.375 ± 1.179; DMT = 8.556 ± 1.642; P value = 0.6977, Student’s t test). These data indicate that DMT administration does not grossly impair locomotion 1 h after dosing, but does have anxiogenic affects. We find that the behavioral effects in the NIL and EPM paradigms of a single hallucinogenic dose of DMT administered to rats are consistent with those of ayahuasca reported by PicTaylor and coworkers.29 Specifically, both DMT and ayahuasca reduce exploratory behavior (e.g., total distance traveled and number of rearings) in the open field, but do not influence thigmotaxis, a more traditional measure of anxiety in the open field.54 Furthermore, both DMT and ayahuasca tend to decrease the amount of time rats spend in the exposed areas of an elevated plus maze. These results contrast with the effects of harmine in these paradigms33,35,36 and suggest that DMT is the component of ayahuasca that decreases exploratory behavior and promotes acute anxiety in rats. This conclusion is further supported by the seminal work of Geyer and coworkers, as they found that DMT decreased exploratory behaviors, decreased rearing, and promoted avoidance of the center of the arena in the behavioral pattern monitor.55,56 Seeing as these behaviors did not occur in familiar environments, they concluded that DMT and related compounds potentiate neophobia. The majority of studies regarding ayahuasca have focused on its ability to regulate mood and anxiety, and thus, very little is known about its effects on memory. Recently, Oliveira and co-workers discovered that chronic administration of ayahuasca did not impair spatial memory as measured by the Morris water maze, nor did it impact cued fear memory.57 However, chronically administered ayahuasca did enhance both foreground and background contextual fear memory.57 Therefore, we tested the effects of DMT on fear memory. Rodents were subjected to a fear conditioning paradigm (Figure 3a and Figure S2) and both contextual and cued fear memory was assessed. Administration of DMT had no effect on initial freezing behavior prior to receiving foot shocks, however, it did significantly increase freezing immediately after the rodents received the training foot shocks (Figure 3b). This anxiogenic effect is consistent with our NIL and EPM experiments, however, DMT did not have a lasting impact on fear memory, as both contextual and cued fear memory, assessed in the days following conditioning, were indistinguishable between DMT- and vehicle-treated animals (Figure 3b). There are several possible explanations for the differing results between our study and that of Oliveira and co-workers.57 One possibility is that the effects of ayahuasca on fear conditioning are mediated by other compounds in the concoction, and not DMT. Alternatively, there could be differences between acute and chronic treatment paradigms. While DMT did not significantly impact fear conditioning, it did promote cued fear extinction. Animals were fear conditioned as described previously in the absence of drug, and DMT was administered 1 h prior to cued fear extinction training (Figure 4a–e). The following day, cued extinction memory was assessed in the absence of drug. Tone presentations caused the DMT-treated group to freeze significantly less than the control group, indicating that DMT administered prior to extinction training resulted in a stronger extinction memory (Figure 4d and e). Patients with PTSD exhibit deficits in cued extinction recall,58 and thus, compounds capable of enhancing fear extinction learning/memory could prove to be effective therapeutics. Furthermore, our discovery that DMT promotes fear extinction in rats is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that psilocybin and MDMA promote cued fear extinction in mice,59,60 and adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that classical psychedelics and entactogens might be useful for treating PTSD in the clinic.16,17 In fact, MDMA was recently granted “breakthrough therapy” status by the Food and Drug Administration in order to expedite the approval process for this promising therapeutic. In a second experiment, animals were subjected to foreground contextual conditioning using additional and more intense foot shocks in order to raise their baseline contextual freezing levels (Figure 4f–g). Contextual fear memory was extinguished on subsequent days 1 h following administration of DMT. Finally, contextual extinction memory was assessed on day 6 in the absence of drug. The DMT-treated animals were not statistically different from the vehicle control group (Figure 4h). Interestingly, the data from the contextual extinction experiment had a bimodal distribution, suggesting that there were responders and nonresponders to contextual extinction training. Similar results in rat fear extinction experiments have been observed previously.61 Due to the known antidepressant properties of ayahuasca,11,19,20,21,22 we next assessed the effects of DMT in the forced swim test (FST) (Figure 5a), a behavioral paradigm used to identify novel antidepressants, using ketamine as a positive control. We found that DMT significantly decreased the amount of time the rodents spent immobile and increased the amount of time they spent swimming (Figure 5b). There was no significant difference in climbing behavior between DMT- and vehicle-treated animals. Notably, the effects of DMT in the FST were indistinguishable from those of the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine (Figure 5b). These results suggest that DMT has antidepressant properties in rodents. While ayahuasca is known to produce anxiogenic effects in the open field and in the EPM, it also displays robust antidepressant properties in the FST.28,29 Similarly, we find that DMT also decreases immobility and increases swimming behavior in this behavioral paradigm (Figure 5). Because DMT and ayahuasca actually reduce locomotor activity in the open field, the increased swimming behavior observed in the FST can be interpreted as a true antidepressant effect, and not simply due to a confounding effect from changes in general activity levels. Finally, as harmine alone has produced similar results in the FST,31,32 it is likely that both DMT and the β-carboline alkaloids contribute to the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca. It will be interesting to see if DMT and harmine have any synergistic or additive effects that go beyond harmine’s known capacity to increase DMT bioavailability through inhibition of monoamine oxidase.24 DMT is known to inhibit the serotonin transporter,62 which could possibly explain its antidepressant effects in the forced swim test. However, its Ki value is quite low (4 μM) as compared to common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine (Ki value for fluoxetine = 7 nM).63 Furthermore, ayahuasca produces rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant populations, suggesting that it works through a different mechanism than traditional antidepressants.19,20 Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the results presented here is the remarkable similarity between the effects of DMT in rats and those of the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine. In addition to having acute anxiogenic effects in the EPM,64 ketamine facilitates fear extinction learning and reduces immobility in the FST.65,66,67 These known effects of ketamine are the same as what we report here for DMT. In fact, when compared directly, we found that there was no statistical difference between DMT- and ketamine-treated animals in terms of the amount of time they spent immobile, swimming, or climbing in the FST. As the antidepressant effects of ketamine are known to be long-lasting, future studies should investigate if DMT produces similar persistent effects. Ketamine is believed to exert its therapeutic effects by promoting structural and functional plasticity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)—a key brain region involved in both extinction learning68 and the top-down control of mood.69 While the primary receptors targeted by ketamine and DMT are different (i.e., NMDA and 5-HT receptors, respectively), it is intriguing to speculate that they might produce similar downstream effects on neural plasticity ultimately underlying their behavioral effects. Two pieces of evidence suggest that this might be the case. First, DMT is rapidly metabolized,52,53 however, its anxiolytic and antidepressant effects are observed long after the compound has been cleared from the body suggesting that plasticity might result in long-lasting changes contributing to its behavioral effects. Second, the related molecule 5-MeO-DMT was recently shown to promote the expression of proteins involved in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines in human cerebral organoids.70 An important question that remains is whether or not DMT and/or ayahausca, like ketamine, is capable of promoting structural and functional plasticity in prefrontal cortical neurons. Finally, our studies on the effects of DMT in rats raise important questions about the possible roles of endogenous DMT in regulating mood and anxiety. A preponderance of evidence suggests that DMT is a hallucinogenic compound produced by a variety of animals including humans.71 Due to its rapid metabolism, exact in vivo quantification of DMT has proven challenging. Assuming that its endogenous production yields sufficient quantities, the results presented here suggest that it might play a natural role in the regulation of anxiety and mood. In conclusion, we report the effects of DMT—the principle hallucinogenic component of ayahuasca—on rodent behaviors related to anxiety and depression. To the best of our knowledge, we describe the first example in rats of a classical serotonergic psychedelic facilitating fear extinction learning and producing antidepressant effects in the FST. Importantly, we find that like ketamine, DMT produces behavioral responses in several paradigms relevant to anxiety and depression. Our work coupled with the fast-acting clinical effects of ayahuasca, strengthens the growing evidence that classical serotonergic psychedelics might serve as fast-acting antidepressants and anxiolytics.",
60,10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.05.019,"In this study we investigated the acute effects of very low ‘microdoses’ of LSD on mood, cognition, and behavior in healthy young adult volunteers, and identified the threshold doses at which LSD produces detectable subjective effects. We report that at doses one tenth to one twentieth those used recreationally (and more recently in therapeutic settings), LSD produces measurable modest increases in ratings of drug effects scales. At these doses, LSD also had subtle effects on behavioral tasks: tending to increase the number of attempted trials on a creativity task (the Remote Associates Test). This is the first controlled study to investigate the acute subjective and behavioral effects of microdoses of LSD using a placebo-controlled within subjects design in healthy young adult volunteers Doses of 13 and 26μg LSD produced measurable subjective and physiological effects. The effects were linearly dose-related across all three doses, and 26μg LSD significantly increased ratings of “feel drug,” “like drug,” “feel high,” and “dislike drug,” and scores on the ARCI-LSD scale and the Vigor scale on the POMS. Interestingly, the drug also produced dose-dependent alterations of consciousness as measured by the 5D-ASC, which had previously only been shown at 100-200 μg doses (42). Physiologically, the 26μg dose increased blood pressure, but did not significantly affect temperature or heart rate. Previous studies have shown that 200ug LSD increase heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature (23), but the present findings reveal the threshold dose at which LSD produces these effects. This profile of responses to very low doses of LSD extend our understanding of the basic pharmacology of the drug, and set the stage for future studies on the behavioral and physiological effects of repeated doses of LSD There is some evidence that higher doses of LSD combined with psychotherapy can have beneficial effects on mood. Case reports and studies from the 1950s and 1960s suggest that LSD may be effective in a clinical context (reviewed in 43), and recent studies are investigating 100-200 μg LSD in combination with psychotherapy for anxiety associated with life threatening illnesses (18). Our participants were healthy and without mood disturbances. It is possible that their increased ratings of “Vigor” after 26 ug could contribute to beneficial effects for patients in a psychotherapy setting, but this remains to be established in patient samples. The items on the Vigor subscale of the POMS include such adjectives as “lively,” “active,” “energetic,” “cheerful,” “alert,” “full of pep,” “carefree,” and “vigorous.” Although some of these effects may fit with the reported mood effects of “microdosers” in the community setting, the effects of repeated microdoses of LSD in clinical populations of symptomatic volunteers remain to be determined While single larger doses of LSD have been shown to have beneficial effects on mood, few studies have examined smaller doses administered at regular intervals. In rodents, repeated low doses of psilocin and ketamine reduce anxiety-like behavior (44, 45) and enhance learning in animal models of depression (17). Anecdotal reports in humans suggest that repeated (every 3 days) ingestion of microdoses of LSD enhance mood and reduce ratings of depression (1). A recent survey of 98 regular microdosers suggested that the drug improved psychological functioning including reductions in depression and stress and lower distractibility (6). Although we did not detect effects of single doses on mood or depression, it remains to be determined whether anti-depressant effects would be detected in individuals who report significant levels of depression Although some previous studies have suggested improvements in cognition, these were not detected here on the DSST or N-back tasks. Few studies have assessed acute effects of LSD on cognition. In one recent study LSD (100 μg) significantly increased “cognitive bizarreness” (46), and in another study LSD (10 μg) altered time perception, resulting in the over-reproduction of temporal intervals greater than 2 seconds (30). One recent naturalistic, open-label (pre-post) study, microdosing psilocybin-containing truffles improved convergent and divergent thinking without affecting analytic cognition on two creativity tasks (31). Although we found that LSD marginally increased the number of attempted trials on a measure of creativity, overall we detected minimal effects on cognitive function Several previous studies using higher doses of LSD have shown acute effects on emotion processing. One study showed that LSD (100-200μg) impaired recognition of fearful facial expressions (25), and in an fMRI study LSD (100 μg) dampened amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex reactivity to fearful faces (47). Interestingly, greater reduction in amygdala response was related to greater subjective drug effects. In another recent study the 5HT1A/2A agonist, psilocybin, at a relatively higher dose (0.215mg/kg) reduced feelings of social rejection during Cyberball (48). We did not observe similar results in our sample, perhaps because of drug or dose differences. Finally, we showed that microdoses of LSD decrease positivity ratings of positive images. This finding was surprising, and went against our hypothesis that the drug, in light of reports of antidepressant effects, may positively bias responses to affective stimuli. One possible explanation for our results is that LSD reportedly enhances global connectivity in the brain, giving rise to the phenomenon of “ego dissolution,” or a weakening of the boundary between the self and the universe (49). This increased connectivity between normally distinct networks (defaul-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) may affect perception of valenced stimuli, leading subjects to rate “positive” images as less positive Our study had a number of strengths. Most notably, we tested three doses of the drug, compared to placebo, under double-blind conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. The participants included men and women, who were free of other drugs or alcohol at the time of testing. We allowed 7 days for drug clearance between the sessions. We used standardized self-report questionnaires, emotion and cognitive tests and obtained physiological measures at regular intervals. Until now, the effects of these very low doses of LSD have been investigated mainly in naturalistic open-label studies and through surveys (6, 31, 50). Here we present a profile of the full range of responses to the acute doses of the drug, including subjective, behavioral, affective and cognitive, in healthy young adults. In line with the conclusions of (6), we conclude that the 13 μg dose would be optimal for a repeated dosing study, as it produced minimal subjective, behavioral or physiological effects that might interfere with normal function. The findings form a basis for future studies investigating repeated doses and doses in clinical populations, to determine the empirical basis of the purported therapeutic affects reported by regular users of these drugs The effects of low doses of LSD should be investigated when the drug is administered repeatedly, and in individuals who report negative affect. Individuals who report microdosing in their everyday lives take the drug every 3-5 days, and it is possible that the beneficial effects emerge only after repeated administration. This could be because of subtle pharmacokinetic accumulation of the drug, or it could be because of pharmacodynamic neural adaptations that occur over days. An important aim for future research will be to collect pharmacokinetic data, extending existing data with higher doses (32). Regular users claim that the drug improves mood and cognition, which raises the possibility that their normal mood and cognitive function were less than optimal before using the drug. Therefore, it is important to examine the effect of LSD, either in single doses or in repeated dosing regimens, in populations reporting clinical mood symptoms, such as anxiety or depression. Studies such as this, investigating the mood and cognitive effects of low doses of psychedelic drugs under controlled conditions will advance our understanding of the neural and behavioral processes underlying depressed mood, and could lead to new treatments",
61,10.1007/s00213-018-5106-2,"This is the first preregistered report on microdosing psychedelics and is intended to inform future lab-based clinical intervention studies. We investigated psychedelic microdosing in online communities and tested pre-registered hypotheses (https://osf.io/ke49d/) concerning the relationship between experience with microdosing and various mental health and personality variables. Our results suggest a beneficial relationship wherein experience with microdosing is associated with lower dysfunctional attitudes and negative emotionality and higher wisdom, open-mindedness, and creativity. The most popular substances used to microdose were LSD and psilocybin, and no significant differences were found based on substance choice. Hypotheses predicting perceived importance of microdosing from dose-related practices were unsupported and optimal dose scheduling remains an open question. Exploratory analyses revealed that microdosers, especially current microdosers, had more positive emotional valence than nonmicrodosers, whereas emotional intensity was not significantly different. Taken together, these findings suggest that randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of microdosing are warranted to investigate the causal efficacy of microdosing. Consistent with our hypotheses, microdosing experience was associated with meaningfully lower levels of dysfunctional attitudes. Individuals with higher dysfunctional attitudes maintain a set of disadvantageous beliefs that increase vulnerability to stressors (Jarrett et al., 2012) and high scores are associated with depression (Adler et al., 2015; de Graaf et al., 2009). Also consistent with our hypotheses was the lower negative emotionality seen in microdosers, though the estimated effect was less precise. Tendencies to experience negative emotionality (e.g. anxiety, depression, emotional volatility) are a robust predictor of mental and physical health problems (Lahey, 2009) thus reduced vulnerability is reflected in the lower scores seen in microdosers. Exploratory analysis revealed that microdosers had more positive emotional valence than non-microdosers, linking microdosing to better mood states. While causation cannot be inferred from these results, significant differences were preserved even after controlling for potent covariates, such as gender and history of mental illness, indicating a potentially distinct contribution of microdosing on mental health vulnerability that warrants further study. Microdosers also had higher wisdom, which is a complex trait (BWSS, Glück et al., 2013). As measured by the BWSS, wisdom is understood to reflect learning from one's mistakes, considering multiple perspectives when facing a situation, being in tune with one's own emotions and the emotions of others, and feeling a sense of connection and unity. Higher scores, as seen in this sample of microdosers, may be associated with cognitive and emotional processing differences including enhanced capacity for perspective taking, resilience in the face of the vicissitudes of life, and increased feelings of engagement and connection. RCT research addressing the relationship between wisdom and microdosing are warranted. Greater open-mindedness was expected in microdosers compared to controls due to previous studies noting increases in openness following a full-dose of psilocybin (MacLean, Johnson, & Griffiths, 2011). These differences were supported, though this effect was relatively weaker than the others. Still, given the findings from full-dose psychedelic studies, future clinical intervention research should continue investigating any causal relationship between openmindedness and microdosing. Microdosers were more creative when finding unusual uses for household items. This is consistent with Fredrickson's (2004) Broaden and Build theory, which suggests a positive relationship between creativity and positive affect, which was also seen in microdosers. Happier, more creative people may be more likely to apply novel modes of thinking in their personal and interpersonal challenges (Fredrickson, 2004). Our findings are also consistent with the anecdotal reports that a relationship between microdosing, creativity, and mood exists, but RCTs, ideally with multiple creativity measures, are required. None of our hypotheses concerning the importance of microdosing benefits and microdosing practices were supported. It is likely that this measure was not sensitive and specific enough; planned analyses of qualitative benefits and drawbacks of microdosing will be explored in a separate report (Anderson et al., 2018). It may be that microdosing frequency is truly unrelated to the subjective valuation of microdosing, but this seems improbable. We suggest that this research question is best addressed in RCT studies focused on specific benefits with experimental manipulation of dose and schedule to determine optimal benefit-specific protocols. Similarly, there is no evidence that outcomes are predicated on prior experience with substances, whether full-dose psychedelics or with a variety of substances. More microdosers had experience with full-doses (69%, n=412) then did not (31%, n=182) and many microdosers (and nonmicrodosers) had experience with full-dose psychedelics within the month prior to completing the survey. As full-dose psychedelics can have benefits lasting at least a month (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017) this covariate should be formally modelled in future microdosing research designs, which should aim to include both psychedelic-naïve and psychedelic-experienced participants.","This study provides initial, correlational evidence for mental health and personality benefits associated with microdosing psychedelics. While anecdotal reports of microdosing benefits have existed for some time (Fadiman, 2011), this study marks the first formal study of the topic. Additionally, the use of a pre-registered study design sets a precedent for responsible and replicable psychedelic microdosing research. To add depth to the current discussion, a full epidemiological report (Rosenbaum et al., 2018) and a Grounded Theory analysis of qualitative outcomes (Anderson et al., 2018) are forthcoming. The results of the present study suggest that there is a significant relationship between microdosing experience and measures of mental health and flourishing including lower dysfunctional attitudes and negative emotionality, higher wisdom and open-mindedness, and higher creativity and affect-valence. These findings are the initial evidence that warrants RCTs to directly test safety and therapeutic efficacy. With approximately 30,000 users subscribing to the /r/microdosing subreddit and thousands more reading media reports on microdosing this growing community continues to explore microdosing and its effects. It is our hope that scientific reporting can help to clarify and inform the public about the nature of microdosing’s putative effects and that this new paradigm helps shape future psychedelic research. We hope that researchers will draw on our shared resources (https://osf.io/g5cwy/) and pre-register studies of their own so that psychedelic science will be built upon strong research practices. Insights from these and other studies will form the backbone of future research into microdosing psychedelics."
62,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.12.041,"Increased amygdala responses to emotional faces were observed one day after treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Post-treatment increases in amygdala responses to fearful versus neutral faces were related to a successful clinical outcome one week later Importantly, the present findings are in contrast to observations of decreased amygdala responses after treatment with conventional antidepressants and particularly with SSRIs (Ma, 2015). It has been proposed that decreased amygdala responsiveness to negative emotional stimuli under SSRIs is a key component of their therapeutic action (Harmer et al., 2017), but the present study's findings suggest that this model does not extend to the therapeutic action of psilocybin for TRD (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) Observations of reduced amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli (Ma, 2015) and reduced behavioural response biases to negative stimuli with conventional antidepressants (Harmer et al., 2009) have been interpreted as evidence of a functional remediation, linked to the correcting of negative cognitive biases in depression. However, it is suggested that chronically-used antidepressants have a more generalised effect on emotional processing, moderating not just responsiveness to negative emotional stimuli, but emotional stimuli more broadly (Price et al., 2009). Focusing specifically on the amygdala, this structure is known to be generally sensitive to emotional salience, regardless of the emotional valence of the stimuli (Adolphs, 2010, Santos et al., 2011). It is possible that the notion that SSRIs have a selective action on amygdala responses to negative stimuli is fallible, and rather, SSRIs and related antidepressants have a more generalised muting influence on amygdala responses to emotionally salient stimuli. Relatedly, negative stimuli may be processed as especially salient, and thus be associated with greater amygdala responses – which are subsequently hyper-sensitive to intervention-led change Reduced amygdala responses to emotional stimuli after chronic antidepressant medication has been linked with activation of post-synaptic serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1ARs), which have an inhibitory action on pyramidal cell firing (Andrade, 2011) and are densely expressed in the amygdala. While this mechanism has a solid empirical basis (Cowen and Browning, 2015, Deakin and Graeff, 1991), there is no known mechanism to explain how 5-HT1AR-induced attenuation of amygdala responsiveness can selectively apply to negative stimuli, without simultaneously affecting the processing of positive stimuli of an equivalent salience. Indeed, there is evidence of blunting of positive mood with SSRIs (Price et al., 2009). Moreover the relative ineffectiveness of conventional serotonergic antidepressant medications to alleviate anhedonia may be explained by a generalised moderation of emotional responsiveness with these drugs (McCabe et al., 2010) We recently carried out a qualitative analysis of patient experiences from this clinical trial, asking patients whether psilocybin with psychological support has been effective for them, and if so, how? Since the majority of patients reported improvements with the treatment, most answered in the affirmative and described a greater willingness to accept all emotions post-treatment (including negative ones). These effects were often contrasted with those of their previous depression treatments which they described as working to reinforce emotional avoidance and disconnection (Watts et al., 2017). Conversely, psilocybin was said to make emotional ‘confrontation’ more likely, and the accompanying psychological support helped patients achieve an emotional breakthrough (catharsis) and resolution (Eisner and Cohen, 1958, Gasser et al., 2014b). Consistently, recent work has suggested that overcoming challenging emotional phenomena under a psychedelic is predictive of better long-term mental health outcomes (Carbonaro et al., 2016) It is important to highlight an important discrepancy between the present results, observed post acutely in patients treated with psilocybin for major depression viewing emotional faces and those from a previous study in which amygdala responses to emotional stimuli (not faces) were assessed during the acute psilocybin ‘high’ in healthy individuals (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). This latter study reported unspecific decreases in right amygdala responses to negative and neutral stimuli under psilocybin, which, based on the aforementioned similarities with the action of conventional antidepressants, the authors interpreted as supporting an antidepressant action for psilocybin. We advise caution with this interpretation however, not least because our pre versus post resting-state fMRI findings suggest that post-acute changes in spontaneous brain function are very different if not antithetical to psilocybin's acute brain effects (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017). Moreover, findings of ‘attenuated responses’ with potent interventions may be explained by compromised task engagement. A consistent explanation has been used to account for apparent functional impairments in imaging studies of pathological states such as schizophrenia, i.e. impoverished responses are observed because patients do not properly engage with the task and its stimuli (Corbetta et al., 1990, Rees et al., 1997) It is important to acknowledge the limitations of the present study. It would be interesting to collect longer-term imaging data than the 1-day post treatment scanning point chosen here (e.g. one week and one month after treatment with psilocybin). If feasible, it would also be interesting to collect imaging data during the acute experience to see how this relates to post treatment brain changes. Future work may look to combine PET and fMRI to systematically address potential relationships between receptor densities and functional brain measures before and after treatment with psilocybin. The recruitment of a healthy control group, receiving the same interventions would also add value, as would the inclusion of a meaningful comparator condition such as psilocybin alone versus psilocybin in combination with psychological support, plus the same for placebo and perhaps an active pharmacological control, such as an SSRI and/or methylphenidate (Griffiths et al., 2006). As this study was not placebo controlled, the contribution of psilocybin with psychological support cannot be differentiated from psychological support and other aspects of the therapy. It would also be worthwhile to see if the present results extend to a less severe population of depressed patients, including those with less extensive histories of exposure to psychiatric medication Psilocybin represents a novel intervention for major depression that appears to be safe, rapid and potentially enduring in its antidepressant action. Furthermore, it is important to note that psilocybin's abuse potential is low (Johnson and Griffiths, 2017). The original rationale for using psychedelic (‘mind-revealing’) drugs as aides to psychotherapy was that they serve to dismantle psychological defences, allowing suppressed emotional material to surface, sometimes with cathartic effect (Eisner and Cohen, 1958, Gasser et al., 2014b, Grof et al., 2008). The present findings of increased amygdala responsiveness post psilocybin resonate with patients' descriptions of feeling emotionally re-connected and accepting after the treatment (Watts et al., 2017). The finding of a relationship between increased right amygdala responses to fearful > neutral faces post treatment and subsequent clinical improvements adds further endorsement to this interpretation. Future work is required to test the replicability of these findings and test whether enhanced amygdala responsiveness is related to the potentially enduring positive mood effects of psychedelics (Griffiths et al., 2006, Schmid and Liechti, 2017). If confirmed, this would suggest an alternative neurobiological basis to the alleviation of depressive symptoms distinct from that of the SSRI antidepressants (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017) ““I felt so much lighter, like something had been released, it was an emotional purging, the weight and anxiety and depression had been lifted.” “ “I have felt a sense of acceptance; more acceptance of agony, boredom, loneliness. [A] willingness to try to accept the negative times - but also an appreciation of the wonderful times.”",
63,10.1177/0269881119897615,"This is the first report of long-term effects of psilocybin treatment in patients with cancer-related psychiatric and existential distress at two long-term follow-ups. The data suggest that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy was associated with large and significant reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety, as well as improvements in spiritual well-being at an average of 3.2 and 4.5 years following psilocybin administration, after a crossover. The magnitudes of reductions relative to baseline in primary measures of anxiety and depression were large, with the largest effect sizes seen for global distress of combined anxiety and depression. Approximately 60–80% of participants continued to meet criteria for clinical antidepressant or anxiolytic response and remission at the second LTFU. At the second LTFU, participants overwhelmingly (71–100%) attributed subjective experiences of positive changes to the psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy experience, reporting improved well-being or life satisfaction, and rating it among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives Due to the limitations of the crossover design of the parent study, it is not possible to attribute long-term improvements in psychiatric and existential distress directly to psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The majority of participants met criteria for an adjustment disorder (on the DSM-IV-TR) relative to cancer-related stressors at enrollment, and 71% reported entering partial or complete cancer remission at the second LTFU. Participants may have thus experienced naturalistic or spontaneous diminishment of distress and resolution of their adjustment disorders as they entered remission and approached the five-year cancer survival threshold. It is also possible that other psychiatric interventions received after the end of the parent trial accounted for improvements in depressive or anxious symptoms. However, this possibility is less likely given that in the follow-up assessment period only 8% of participants reported receiving any psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy specifically targeting cancer-related psychiatric distress These findings have meaningful implications for the clinical management of cancer-related existential distress. It is hopeful to consider the possibility that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy could represent the first empirically-driven pharmacotherapy intervention to treat this indication. Existential distress is under-recognized and under-treated in cancer patients within Western medicine (Cepoiu et al., 2008; Gouveia et al., 2015). Among medical illnesses, depression and hopelessness associated with a diagnosis of cancer can serve as severe stressors and are well-known risk factors for suicidal ideation and completed suicides (Rosenfeld et al., 2011; Breitbart et al., 2000). The potential rapidity and long-term durability of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy’s effects represents a promising protective strategy against suicides. Future trials should carefully explore this application with cancer populations with chronic, passive suicidality, as there is preliminary evidence that psychedelic use may prevent suicidal ideation and behaviors (Hendricks et al., 2015; Johansen and Krebs, 2015) An intriguing finding from our analyses was that the greater amount of time that had passed between participants’ psilocybin session and the second LTFU predicted stronger reductions in subjective reports of depression and hopelessness during this period. The significance of this finding is unclear. However, it is interesting to consider that certain domains of cancer-related distress, particularly certain key domains of existential distress, could continue to improve rather than diminish over time in relation to a single psilocybin session. The extended follow-up is an important strength of this study as the vast majority of psycho-oncology RCTs to treat psychological distress report a follow-up period of typically no more than one year following treatment (Faller et al., 2013; Gasser et al., 2015; Stagl et al., 2015) If it were established that psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy effectively treats cancer-related psychiatric and existential distress, it would be important to understand the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms of action. In our previous report, the psilocybin-facilitated mystical-type experience was found to partially mediate the effect of dose sequence on anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy prior to the crossover, suggesting that acute aspects of participants’ subjective experience may explain changes in psychiatric outcomes up to seven weeks (Ross et al., 2016). In the present study, a mystical-type experience was not associated with long-term changes at the LTFU points. A reduction in power might have weakened our ability to detect an effect as the sample size in this LTFU study was reduced by 50%. It is also possible that the mystical-type experience does not represent a significant psychological change mechanism accounting for psilocybin’s therapeutic effects, or that other aspects of participants’ experiences are more influential in determining longer-term response. However, given the growing body of evidence linking the intensity of the psilocybin-facilitated mystical-type experience to therapeutic improvements across a range of psychiatric and addictive disorders (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2016; Pahnke et al., 1969; Roseman et al., 2019; Ross et al., 2016), it is important to further explore this potential psychological mechanism of action in additional adequately-powered RCTs. It would also be important to explore other potential psychological change mechanisms of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in this patient population One such mechanism may relate to rapid and enduring shifts in cognition. Classic psychedelics offer a rapid means of dismantling habitual mental templates that, over time, may rigidify one’s attention and behavior—patterns that are associated with various psychiatric pathologies (Carhart-Harris, 2018; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019). Psychedelic-induced states of consciousness are, instead, associated with increases in trait openness and cognitive flexibility (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Kuypers et al., 2016). In an open-label trial of psilocybin in patients with treatment-resistant depression participants reported increased trait openness, with significant increases in the following sub-traits: “openness to values” (i.e. valuing open-mindedness and psychological flexibility) and “openness to actions” (i.e. readiness to try and engage in new activities; Erritzoe et al., 2018). Being open to novel and more constructive ways of thinking, feeling and behaving is one of the central goals of contemporary evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (Hayes et al., 2012)), and enhanced cognitive and psychological flexibility may constitute a psychological mechanism mediating psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy’s antidepressant and anxiolytic effects (Watts and Luoma, 2020). Further, given the link between enhanced mystical-type states and enduring increases in trait openness (MacLean et al., 2011), it is possible that certain features of the mystical-type state (e.g. dissolution of boundaries and feelings of unity) lead one to develop enduring increases in psychological flexibility when coupled with supportive psychotherapy. The psilocybin experience may have enabled participants to establish a new inner framework from which they could flexibly avail themselves of resources internally and in their environment to cope with life stressors, particularly stressors associated with their cancer diagnoses It is also possible that other aspects of the acute psilocybin experience, such as challenging (Barrett et al., 2016) or emotional breakthrough experiences (Roseman et al., 2019), are more influential in explaining long-term changes of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. The resolution and integration of difficult emotions may be particularly relevant for clinical populations such as cancer patients, and such emotional processing may support the development of greater psychological flexibility and emotional regulation in the long-term (Lane et al., 2015). It would be important to assess these potential psychological change mechanisms in future trials that are adequately designed and powered. These theories are supported by a growing consensus that serotonin 2A signaling mediates functional shifts in connectivity in cortico-striato-thalmo-cortical pathways (Preller et al., 2019), increased entropy in the brain (Carhart-Harris, 2018), and disruption of activity within the default mode network, a brain system that is associated with self-referential information processing and mind-wandering (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017; Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017; Ly et al., 2018). These theories are also consistent with the quantitative (Ross et al., 2016) and qualitative (Belser et al., 2017; Swift et al., 2017) findings from the parent trial and the present study of highly memorable, meaningful, and spiritually significant effects attributed to the psilocybin experience. We strongly believe, however, that an isolated experience with psilocybin does not inherently confer therapeutic benefits. Rather, the development of an enduring therapeutic experience is contingent on contextual factors, such as the presence of skilled therapists or guides, which facilitate a larger psychotherapeutic process. It is, therefore, important to recognize that purely neurobiological interpretations regarding brain activity during acute phases of a psilocybin experience will not adequately capture the dynamics of a psychotherapeutic process that may unfold in the weeks or months thereafter, fostering enhanced meaning and greater well-being","In summary, the findings of this LTFU study represent the first suggestion of persistent long-term effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for cancer-related distress. Although limited conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy due to the crossover design, results suggests that the treatment continues to be associated with reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety up to an average of 4.5 years following a single psilocybin session in conjunction with psychotherapy. Theories regarding neurobiological and psychological change mechanisms remain speculative and exploratory. Further research will need to validate the main findings of the parent trial and this LTFU article with a fully experimental design in order to empirically establish the use of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat the psychiatric and existential distress of those with life-threatening cancer diagnoses An advanced experimental design of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy would likely include a larger sample size (i.e. N=200) that is nationally representative of cancer patients. It would also include randomized, parallel groups without a crossover, use of an adequate placebo control group, measures taken to minimize blinding and expectancy effects, and the use of valid and reliable outcome measures. It might also include design elements that would allow for exploration of potential neurobiological (e.g. growth factor expression, functional connectivity, neuroplasticity) and psychological (e.g. mystical experience, personality, psychological flexibility, emotional breakthroughs and insights, challenging experiences) mechanisms of action of psilocybin-assisted therapy Funding for psychedelic research in the USA remains mostly limited to the private sector at present time. It would be an historic and important milestone if the National Institutes of Health were to fund advanced research exploring the therapeutic potential of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with life-threatening cancer and concomitant psychiatric and existential distress. If the Food and Drug Administration were to sanction this next phase of research (i.e. phase III trials) for this clinical indication, and favorable findings were to emerge, it could help to form a pathway for psilocybin to become re-scheduled and clinically available for cancer patients. It would represent a major paradigm shift in the psycho-oncological approach and care of patients with cancer. The use of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for those with life-threatening cancer could be especially useful in helping patients approach their lives with enhanced psychological, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing"
64,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01234,"In this study, we found an interaction between serum BDNF and serum cortisol levels at baseline. The serum cortisol was predictor of baseline serum BDNF of volunteers. Individuals with hypocortisolemia, both patients and controls, presented lower serum BDNF levels when compared to volunteers with eucortisolemia (patients and controls). Moreover, we found a negative correlation between serum cortisol and serum BDNF in eucortisolemic volunteers. However, neither BDNF nor cortisol levels were predictors of major depression and none of the clinical characteristics of patients predicted their BDNF levels. Forty-eight hours after treatment (D2), we observed higher BDNF levels in both groups (patients and controls) who were treated with ayahuasca, compared to those treated with placebo. In addition, at D2 patients treated with ayahuasca, and not with placebo, presented a negative significant correlation between BDNF levels and MADRS scores. However, the number of previous unsuccessful antidepressant treatments was the main predictor of remission rates found at D2 These results corroborate in part our initial hypotheses. On one hand, we found a relationship between serum cortisol and serum BDNF at baseline. Among the various responses induced by the glucocorticoid, the direct modulation of cortisol on BDNF appears to be extremely significant in understanding the etiology and treatment of major depression (Dai et al., 2018). The expression of BDNF in the central nervous system is modulated by various brain molecules, including cortisol. It is known that one interaction between these two molecules occurs at the level of messenger RNA (Tapia-Arancibia et al., 2004; Chou et al., 2016). It is observed that high concentrations of cortisol induce reduction of BDNF gene expression, and hippocampal and neocortex neurogenesis (Duman and Monteggia, 2006; Lupien et al., 2007; Ozan et al., 2010; Schwabe et al., 2012). Analogously, low concentrations of the cortisol interfere negatively in the expression of BDNF. An inverted U-curve relationship between cortisol and BDNF has been proposed, where intermediate levels of cortisol are the most suitable for the expression of BDNF (Tapia-Arancibia et al., 2004) In addition, it is suggested that there is an interaction between TrkB and GR receptor activity. In order TrkB receptor to be activated by BDNF, the GR receptor must be coupled to the TrkB, forming a complex. When cortisol levels are high, cortisol binds to its GR receptor and removes it from the complex, reducing the potential response of BDNF (Numakawa et al., 2017). Therefore, the literature suggests that allostatic levels of cortisol are important to adequate BDNF expression and function. Herein, this hypothesis is corroborated by the model where baseline serum cortisol levels predict serum BDNF levels and by the negative correlation between BDNF and cortisol found only for eucortisolemic volunteers that consequently induced a baseline difference in serum BDNF levels of eucortisolemic and hypocortisolemic volunteers in our study Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is a broad-acting neurotrophin that plays important roles in protection, differentiation, viability and growth of new neurons (Lopes et al., 2017), and its effects go beyond the central nervous system (Wolkowitz et al., 2011; Pius-Sadowska and Machaliñski, 2017). Outside of nervous system, the BDNF is mainly synthesized in platelets, which also is the main storage site of peripheral tissues (Nurden, 2018). Rodent studies point out to the existence of bidirectional transport of BDNF in the blood–brain barrier (Khalin et al., 2016; Xing et al., 2016; Tharmaratnam et al., 2018), and peripheral administration of BDNF enhances hippocampal neurogenesis in mice, indicating that blood levels of BDNF are significant for brain function (Schmidt and Duman, 2010). Recent evidence suggests that several pathways of neuronal plasticity are activated by psychedelic compounds (Winkelman, 2017). The induction of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis by psychedelics are a relevant aspect of their action as potential antidepressants since several studies have shown that the efficacy of clinical antidepressants is related to an increase in hippocampal plasticity induced after monoaminergic enhancement (Dakic et al., 2016; Ardalan et al., 2017; Morales-García et al., 2017) Even though most studies suggest that the serum BDNF levels of patients with depression are significantly lower than healthy controls (Gersner et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2017; Alves and Rocha, 2018; Wagner et al., 2018), this finding is not unanimous (Hellweg et al., 2008; Jevtović et al., 2011; Molendijk et al., 2011; Papakostas et al., 2011; Elfving et al., 2012). In our study, baseline serum BDNF levels, baseline serum cortisol levels, sex and income did not predict major depression and we did not find any clinical characteristics that predict baseline levels of BDNF in the group of patients. Both results are opposite to our hypothesis. Here, the variable age could predict the presence of depressive symptoms. However, as our patients were older than controls, this find might be biased by this baseline difference It has been speculated that wash-out periods may mask the expected reduced BDNF levels found in depression, as it is been proposed that antidepressants stimulate BDNF synthesis (Wilkinson et al., 2018). In fact, studies indicate that the reduction of BDNF is most consistently observed after a 4-week wash-out period (Brunoni et al., 2008; Yip et al., 2017) or in severe untreated patients (Kreinin et al., 2015). Herein, all patients were in a 2-week wash-out period, which might not have been enough to allow the detection of lower BDNF levels at baseline. Furthermore, there are still controversies regarding the correlation between blood and central BDNF levels. There is no consensus in the literature about how far human blood BDNF reflects accurately the concentration of BDNF in the central nervous system (Sen et al., 2008; MacQueen, 2009). Therefore, this could also explain why we did not find difference in BDNF levels between healthy controls and depressed patients and the baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression in our study In addition, it is important to note that more recently three isoforms of BDNF have been identified. The intracellular synthesis of BDNF is initiated as the pre-pro-BDNF precursor form, and then the pre-region is removed resulting in the pro-BDNF form (Mizui et al., 2014; Foltran and Diaz, 2016), which after a new cleavage forms mature BDNF (m-BDNF) and BDNF pro-peptide. In vitro assays suggest that pro-BDNF is the major secreted form, not m-BDNF (Mowla et al., 2001; Kowiañski et al., 2017), but in the extracellular medium, the pro-BDNF may undergo cleavage by the action of plasmin (Diniz et al., 2018). The pro-BDNF/m-BDNF ratio seems to be critical for the determination of physiological or pathological conditions (Yoshida et al., 2012; Foltran and Diaz, 2016; Angoa-Perez et al., 2017). Increased pro-BDNF levels in the prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area, and reduced levels of m-BDNF in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are observed in different studies using animal models of depression (Lippmann et al., 2007; Shirayama et al., 2015; Hashimoto, 2016; Zhao G. et al., 2016; Zhao M. et al., 2016). Despite this, studies with humans that analyze pro-BDNF/m-BDNF ratio in blood are infrequent, and few studies showed changed ratio in patients with major depression (Yoshida et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013; Sodersten et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2017). Both m-BDNF, BDNF pro-peptide and pro-BDNF can interact with Trk and p75NTR receptor, although each one exhibits different biological activities (Mizui et al., 2014; Porcher et al., 2018). The m-BDNF has high affinity for TrkB receptors (Li et al., 2018) and its activation has been implicated in neural excitability and increased synaptic strength (Jiang et al., 2017). On the other hand, pro-BDNF and BDNF pro-peptide performs their biological actions mainly through the binding to p75NTR neurotrophin receptors and have been described as inhibitor of excitability and facilitators of synaptic depression (Mizui et al., 2014; Phillips, 2017). The commercial kit used in our study is not sensitive to different BDNF isoforms, and the measurement is related to the total BDNF amount of both isoforms We initially supposed that ayahuasca would modulate BDNF levels, and this was observed. After dosing (D2) we found higher levels of BDNF in individuals treated with ayahuasca compared to placebo, regardless of the group (MD or CG). The between-treatment effect size was medium. Additionally, patients that were treated with ayahuasca, and not with placebo, presented a negative significant correlation between BDNF levels and MADRS scores at D2: higher serum BDNF levels were correlated with lower depression symptomatology after the session with ayahuasca N, N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), the main active compound of ayahuasca, activates 5-HT2A and σ1R pathways involved in neuroplasticity (Fields and Mitchell, 2017; Inserra, 2018). Ayahuasca also induces an acute increase of cortisol levels (Santos et al., 2011; Galvão et al., 2018). Specifically, these same volunteers showed an increase of approximately 100% of salivary cortisol 1 h 40 min after ayahuasca intake, which probably was important to reach physiological levels of this hormone in hypocortisolemic volunteers (Galvão et al., 2018). Thus, the cortisol pathway could be critically implied in the mechanism related to how ayahuasca modulation of BDNF molecule. Although this study suggests higher levels of BDNF in volunteers treated with ayahuasca than those treated with placebo, a detailed explanation of specific pathways possibly involved in ayahuasca modulation of serum BDNF expression needs further pre-clinical and clinical investigation. Nevertheless, the early association between ayahuasca treatment and BDNF found herein 48 h after the dosing session gives support to a potential mechanism behind the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca. In this sense, it is also important highlight that previous studies also described significant increases in serum BDNF levels just after a longer period of antidepressant treatment, i.e., after 8–12 weeks (Gonul et al., 2003; Aydemir et al., 2005), only psychedelics with antidepressant potential that demonstrate rapid action via BDNF synthesis and secretion (Kavalali and Monteggia, 2015; Harmer et al., 2017) However, at D2 neither serum BDNF levels nor the type of treatment (AYA or PLA) predicted remission rates at D2. It is important to highlight, however, that we did not observe a significant difference on remission rates at D2 between treatments (AYA and PLA) in our original clinical trial (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2018). In that study, the strongest effect size and a significant difference between treatments on response and remission rates were observed only at D7 (Palhano-Fontes et al., 2018), and we did not measure BDNF at D7. On the other hand, the number of previous antidepressant treatments predicted remission rates at D2, where patients that were in remission at D2 had a smaller number of previous unsuccessful antidepressant treatments than patients that did not achieve remission Despite previous findings indicating a positive correlation between antidepressant effects and the expression of BDNF (Zhou et al., 2017), not all studies support this finding (Castren and Rantamaki, 2008; Piccinni et al., 2008; Halaris et al., 2015). Few studies using double-blind placebo-controlled design have investigated BDNF in major depression (Teche et al., 2013; Brunoni et al., 2014), and studies with psychedelic substances evaluating depression patients are scarce. Ketamine, an anesthetic with psychedelic proprieties, have been tested in MD patients and animal models (Haile et al., 2014; Lepack et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2015; Ly et al., 2018), and patients with treatment resistant depression exhibited increased plasma BDNF after a ketamine session only in responders between 4 h after intake until 1 week later (Haile et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2015) In addition to some limitations discussed above, other restrictions in the present study should be considered. First, the genetic factor related to BDNF was not considered in this work. Some studies suggest that major depressive disorder is directly linked to single nucleotide functional polymorphism of BDNF, leading to valine (Val) substitution by methionine (Met) at codon 66 (Val66Met), and heterozygous patients presenting the Val66Met polymorphism have more promising responses to antidepressants when compared to Val/Val homozygotes (Brandl and Walter, 2017; Kao et al., 2018). Second, serum cortisol and BDNF were measured only once, and considering that these molecules have circadian rhythm (Wright et al., 2015; Cain et al., 2017), studies that cover sequential measurements throughout the day and for different days could point to more precise results This was the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial for depression that investigated changes in BDNF levels after an intervention with a psychedelic substance. The results point to important observations, such as the report of different baseline serum BDNF levels in respect to serum cortisol, higher levels of BDNF in volunteers treated with ayahuasca than placebo 48 h after the dosing session, as well a clear association between higher serum BDNF and lower symptoms of depression at D2. Our results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant",
65,10.1177/0022167817715966,"The aim of this qualitative analysis was to capture, through narrative accounts, an in-depth understanding of the experiences of those who participated in a RCT of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for cancer-related emotional distress (Ross et al., 2016). That study along with a corresponding study (Griffiths et al., 2016), revealed that a single administration of psilocybin led to rapid, substantial, and enduring anxiolytic and antidepressant effects up to 6 months after participants’ sessions (Ross et al., 2016). The present analysis revealed 10 distinct themes focusing on the therapeutic effects of psilocybin administration on cancer-related psychological and existential distress. These supplement themes described in our previous article, which documented a wide range of additional phenomena from the treatment, including positive effects on relationships, a detailed description of visual and emotional phenomena, and other supportive factors of the study design (e.g., music; Belser et al., 2017) The present study revealed that the psilocybin sessions were generally described as immersive and experiential in nature, with insights and visions not merely imagined or thought but felt as lived experiences for the participants. During their sessions, many participants experienced a loss of self and a sense of merging within visionary landscapes, similarly described in reports of mystical (Stace, 1961), transcendent or peak (Maslow, 1959), and unitive consciousness experiences (Pahnke, 1969). A number of well-documented psychological processes share attributes with psilocybin therapy, including the experiential (Perls, Hefferline, & Goodman, 1951), imaginal (Edwards, 1989), and “felt sense” (Gendlin, 1982), as well as in the mindfulness literature, such as “meta-awareness” (Garland, Farb, Goldin, & Fredrickson, 2015). It has been hypothesized that these therapy modalities function by transcending habitual patterns of relating to one’s difficulties, providing experiential access to cognitive structures or complex situations beyond what could be said or thought. It appears that the experiential and immersive quality of the psilocybin therapy may help explain the immediate and enduring positive changes in participants’ lives after a single session, beyond the mere reduction of symptoms The felt quality of immersion and “intense struggle” of the psilocybin led many participants to report transient forms of fear or distress during their session, with one participant experiencing negative psychological effects in the days immediately following. However, all participants experienced resolution of these manifest difficulties either spontaneously or with the support of study therapists. This research, along with the findings from our previous article (Belser et al., 2017), showed that these challenging experiences may be a significant factor in the therapeutic process, leading to important emotional catharses, experiences of surrender, validation of strength, and resolution of unresolved psychological conflicts. These results are consistent with prior research into the nature of challenging experiences from consumers of psilocybin mushrooms, which showed that of the nearly 2,000 participants who completed the survey, 84% endorsed benefiting from their challenging experience, and that the level of difficulty reported was positively correlated with enduring increases in well-being (Carbonaro et al., 2016) This research demonstrated that the therapeutic process with psilocybin involved a powerful reconciliation of the discordant realities of cancer and death in participants’ lives. As for many participants who described “running” from their cancer, it is widely believed that symptoms of distress following a devastating or traumatic event like a cancer diagnosis are maintained in part by avoidance of related stimuli (Walser & Hayes, 2006). The psilocybin experience offered many participants an opportunity to encounter and turn toward death and cancer in profound and dramatic ways, leading to new understandings and relationships to these painful realities. Etymologically, the root of the word reconciliation means “to bring together” or “to make friendly,” which was a common phenomenon found in the narratives. For example, the site of Chrissy’s cancer became a welcomed “umbilical cord to the universe”; cancer joined Erin at a dinner table; death became a pathway for Brenda to return to a beautiful earth; and Victor embraced his body, inclusive of its cancer. Consistent with classical mystical-type experiences (Pahnke, 1963; Pahnke & Richards, 1966; Richards, 1978), participants reported that when experienced directly in the psilocybin session, cancer and death were often no longer seen as separate from life but were now a living process or continuum within it. Furthermore, the differentiation between emotions and cancer described by the participants is consistent with the theory of trauma processing, in which “the uncoupling of sensation from image and thought” is what allows the release of complicated emotions (Levine, 2010). Freed from their overwhelming emotional charge, participants were able to more clearly consider the reality of cancer and death in their lives, and consistently reported no longer being preoccupied or overwhelmed by fear Another significant pathway that could explain improvements in anxiety and depression relates to the more positive, transcendent, and life-affirming aspects of the psilocybin experience. Participants spoke of being pulled from the habitual patterns and overwhelm of cancer and of being given an expanded perspective on what was felt to be most important and meaningful in life, which endured beyond the session. Transcendence, as Cassel (1982) wrote, “is probably the most powerful way in which one is restored to wholeness,” as it locates the person in a “far larger landscape” of possibility, which can bring greater meaning to suffering. These findings help explicate a primary result, derived from the entire sample of the quantitative study (N = 29) from which the current study derived its sample (Ross et al., 2016), which showed that 52% and 70% of all 29 participants rated the psilocybin experience as being among the top five most spiritually significant, or the top five most personally meaningful experiences, of their entire lives, respectively. These results are consistent with prior research on psilocybin with healthy normal volunteers that showed that similar positive attributes in meaning and spiritual significance were enduring at the 14-month follow-up (Griffiths et al., 2008). The idea that positive experiences can lead to expanded life priorities is also consistent with Fredrickson’s (2001) broaden-and-build resilience theory, which posits that positive experiences and emotions expand one’s horizon of possibilities and perspective and can thus bring fortitude in the face of future difficulties Our results showed that following their psilocybin session, participants did not merely return to the level of functioning that existed prior to their cancer diagnosis but rather nurtured a heightened sense of meaning and perspective in their lives. A similar theory of posttraumatic growth articulates the idea that following a life crisis or traumatic event like cancer, individuals may, under the right conditions, experience positive changes in their lives, such as an increase in well-being and sense of life priority (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). It appears that a single therapeutically supported dose of psilocybin served as a catalyst for such growth by reconciling distressing realities of cancer and death, as well as reconnecting participants to abiding sources of meaning in their lives: a heightened sense of spirituality, a deepened reconnection to family and loved ones (Belser et al., 2017), and a greater openness and presence with one’s surroundings. This kind of growth may help explain the enduring effects of the psilocybin treatment, as death and cancer were no longer felt as threatening and could no longer supersede the meaning and sense of connection participants now felt in life. As Victor Frankl (1988) wrote, “Meaning can be found in life literally up to the last moment, up to the last breath, in the face of death”","This study used qualitative methods to describe the subjective experiences of those who underwent psilocybin treatment for cancer-related emotional distress. It identifies major narrative themes that contributed to alleviation of their anxiety and despair, complementing two quantitative studies in the same area (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). Our study provides support for the psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy treatment approach, which is unique in its capacity to induce rapid, substantial, and enduring benefits in anxiety and depression and to occasion deeply meaningful experiences and new perspectives for individuals struggling to assimilate the existential reality of cancer into their lives. For the cancer patient, especially those seeking relief through greater meaning and understanding of the emotional and existential implications of a life-threatening illness, a therapeutically supported psilocybin experience may serve as a powerful intervention. We conclude that the psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy paradigm has the potential to complement the delivery of medical care and psychological treatment for individuals with cancer whose diagnosis precipitates debilitating psychological and existential distress."
66,10.1038/s41598-020-59282-y,"The current open-label pilot study identified four key sustained effects of a single high dose of psilocybin on affect and the neural correlates of affective processing. First, negative affect was decreased 1 week post-psilocybin and returned to baseline levels at 1 month post-psilocybin. Second, there were decreases in amygdala responses to emotional stimuli 1 week post-psilocybin that rebounded at 1 month post-psilocybin. Third, there were increased responses in reward-learning, attention, and decision-making circuits 1 week post-psilocybin, and increased responses in somatosensory and fusiform gyrus 1 month post-psilocybin, during high-demand incongruent trials in the emotional conflict Stroop task. Finally, there were global increases in functional connectivity at both 1 week and 1 month post-psilocybin A notable feature of the current report is that the reported effects of psilocybin were observed well after psilocybin would have been eliminated from the body and beyond expected transient effects of receptor trafficking that may be occurring after psilocybin administration. The half-life of psilocybin and psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) is roughly 3 hours57,58, indicating that over 50 half-lives of the drug had passed before the 1 week time point, ensuring elimination of the drug from each participant. Further, while the 5-HT2A receptor is known to internalize rapidly with both agonism and antagonism, it is thought to be re-expressed roughly 24–48 hours after internalization (in the absence of chronic engagement)59, and thus any transient changes in receptor dynamics related to psilocybin administration would be resolved by the 1 week time point. Rather than receptor trafficking or other residual pharmacological effects, the reported findings might better be explained by a neuroplastic period during which the neural processing of affective stimuli is altered The sustained decreases in negative affective states and traits, increases in positive affective states and traits, and decreases in amygdala responses to emotional stimuli that were observed in this trial all resemble reported acute effects of psilocybin27,28. The observed changes in MOFC, DLPFC, IFG, insula, parietal, and fusiform response to conflicting trials, however, are unexpected findings that may reveal a potential top-down mechanism underlying the sustained effects of psilocybin on affect and brain function Psilocybin may increase the top-down control of emotional processes The DLPFC is broadly implicated in a number of tasks spanning the domains of working memory60, decision making61, and emotion regulation62. Hypoactive DLPFC response to emotional interference has been demonstrated in major depressive disorder, suggesting a deficit in the neural circuitry underlying emotion regulation and top-down control of emotionally conflicting information63, and this hypoactive response has been shown to recover with antidepressant treatment64. DLPFC has also been shown to exert top-down influence on amygdala response during emotion regulation62. Reduced DLPFC recruitment and enhanced amygdala recruitment during down-regulation of negative emotion have been identified across a range of disorders including mood and substance use disorders MOFC response is observed in a wide range of decision-making tasks66,67, and may code the reward value of reinforcers, with an anterior-to-posterior gradient within the OFC suggesting that more abstract reinforcers elicit more anterior OFC response68. The observed increase in anterior MOFC at 1 week post-psilocybin is consistent with increased sensitivity to the abstract reinforcer of positive emotional stimuli. The amygdala and MOFC also have dense bidirectional structural connections that are understood to facilitate top-down modulation of salience detection and reward learning Taken together, increased DLPFC and MOFC response to high-conflict trials in the emotional conflict Stroop at 1 week post-psilocybin task may reflect greater top-down control of emotionally conflicting information and suppression of amygdala response to negative affective stimuli, which may lead to a shift in the relative salience of positive and negative affective information in the environment, and an overall shift in affect. A lack of observed change in behavior during the emotional conflict Stroop may indicate that behavioral performance was already at ceiling during baseline. However, this leaves open the possibility that executive control over emotionally conflicting information was less efficient at 1 week post-psilocybin, leading to greater recruitment of DLPFC and MOFC to maintain the same level of behavior IFG has been implicated in supporting a domain-general interference resolution process69. Activity in the anterior insula is understood to contribute to interoceptive mapping70, and both IFG and insula may be involved in the appraisal of social emotional stimuli71. The fusiform gyrus contains a number of functionally-defined sub-regions dedicated to stimulus-specific object recognition72,73,74, with specialized regions that respond to facial stimuli75,76. Greater recruitment of these brain regions in response to conflicting stimuli at 1 week compared to 1 month post-psilocybin may reflect increased attentional load and more acute visceral representation of emotionally conflicting information.","The current report provides preliminary evidence that psilocybin administration may lead to shifts in affect and the neural correlates of affective processing that endure beyond acute drug effects. Within a dimensional or domain-based taxonomy of brain function and pathology, the reported findings are consistent with a trans-diagnostic process that may underlie both mood and substance use disorders. Reduction of negative affect may undermine ruminative processes that contribute to the development and maintenance of mood disorders, and these effects are consistent with psychological and neural changes that might be expected to accompany antidepressant effects of psilocybin. Disruption of the negative components of craving and withdrawal may undermine the development and maintenance of substance use disorders, consistent with psychological and clinical changes observed in patients with tobacco and alcohol use disorders. Reported findings may also account for long-term positive changes in mood, attitude, and well-being that have been reported in healthy individuals While both negative affect and brain response to affective stimuli were reduced 1 week after psilocybin, they rebounded at the 1 month timepoint, suggesting that psilocybin may have initiated a dynamic and neuroplastic process that was sustained for at least a number of weeks. It is possible that such a neuroplastic period may allow for a more enduring shift towards positive affective. The observed increase in functional connectivity strength indiscriminately across networks may reflect a domain-general cortical plasticity process supporting the observed changes in affective processing, consistent with preclinical evidence for psychoplastogenic properties of psychedelic drugs45,90. Overall, the current findings identify negative affect as a potential therapeutic target of psilocybin"
67,10.1016/j.nicl.2018.03.005,"This study investigated the acute effects of LSD on network connectivity in healthy subjects. We found that acute LSD administration decreased FC within the DMN, the auditory and sensorimotor networks and visual networks 1 and 3. Between-network FC was widely increased; all RSNs were affected to some degree, particularly the cerebellum and the executive network. Seed-to-voxel analysis indicated that increased FC of RSNs on a whole-brain level consistently involved hub structures (specifically thalamus and striatum). Below, we discuss our findings in the context of previous observations obtained after the administration of LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016) and the related hallucinogenic drug psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013; Roseman et al., 2014). Like LSD, psilocybin exerts its effects mainly through agonism at the 5-HT2A-receptor (Vollenweider et al., 1998; Preller et al., 2017) Our results on alterations in within-network connectivity closely resemble those previously reported in LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b), where decreases in coactivation within the DMN, the sensorimotor network and the visual networks 1 and 3 were reported. Additionally, Carhart-Harris et al. reported decreases in the right frontoparietal network and the parietal cortex network and found no alterations within the auditory network. We did not investigate the parietal network in our study and the frontoparietal network was not affected in our analysis. The functional relevance of decreased within-network FC to subjective drug effects is largely unknown. No significant associations were described in previous studies with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013; Roseman et al., 2014). For LSD, decreased coactivation within the DMN was significantly associated with feelings of “ego dissolution” (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b), a finding that could not be replicated in our study – although ego dissolution varied markedly across subjects and correlated with exposure to LSD (Liechti et al., 2016). Within this context, it should be noted, that very similar alterations in within-network connectivity were reported after the administration of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Klaassens et al., 2015). Klaassens et al. studied the effects of sertraline on connectivity using the same RSN templates and similar methods of analysis; they pinpointed exactly the same networks as in our study (DMN, visual networks 1–3, sensorimotor and auditory network). These findings also overlapped with regions identified in a previous study with LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). These effects of sertraline, a drug causing no major subjective effects, call into question the specificity of these alterations and their significance for subjective drug effects. It is possible that they represent an epiphenomen of unspecific serotonergic stimulation Between-network connectivity was examined in two previous studies after administration of either psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013; Roseman et al., 2014) or LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). With psilocybin, FC between an anterior DMN and nine other RSNs was investigated (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013); FC was increased between the anterior DMN and dorsal attention, salience, right frontoparietal, and auditory networks. Broader analyses of FC between several networks indicated widespread increases in between-network FC under psilocybin (Roseman et al., 2014) and – to a considerably lesser extent – under LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). Fig. 5 shows a comparison of these findings of these studies with our results. In general, there was no good accordance within the results of previous studies (Roseman et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b) or between those studies and our findings. It does not seem very likely that these widely divergent findings simply reflect different effects of psilocybin and LSD, as their mechanism of action at the 5HT2A-receptor is very similar (Rickli et al., 2016), as are probably the subjective effects (Hollister and Hartman, 1962; Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964). Furthermore, our results differed considerably from those recently reported for LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b). These differences might be due to significant differences in movement between conditions present in those studies and different methods of analysis, differences in regions covered by RSNs, or the slightly larger sample size in our study. Moreover, routes of administration (i.v. and oral administration) or the previous experiences of participants with hallucinogenic drugs might have affected the results. Seed-to-voxel analyses indicated increased FC between RSNs and several structures known as hubs (precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum and thalamus). Hubs are thought to be of importance for overall brain functioning by serving integration and large-scale interaction (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013; Bell and Shine, 2016). Using functional connectivity density analysis, a previous study has already reported significantly increased global connectivity in several regions after the administration of LSD and psilocybin, including the precuneus and thalamus (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016). In the present study, it was found that FC between the great majority of RSNs and striatum and thalamus was increased after administration of LSD, compared with placebo. Both structures (striatum and thalamus) show widespread structural connections to other brain regions (Jones, 2007; Parent and Hazrati, 1995) and are part of the so called “rich club”, a set of highly connected regions that are densely connected among themselves (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011; Schmidt et al., 2016). The striatum (comprised of caudate and putamen) is the main input structure of the basal ganglia (Parent and Hazrati, 1995) and is connected to numerous cortical regions via loops (Alexander et al., 1986) which pass through the basal ganglia, to the thalamus and back to the cortex (cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops) We have already investigated thalamocortical FC after administration of LSD in the same sample in more detail (Müller et al., 2017). Among others, we found increased global FC of striato-thalamic structures after LSD compared with placebo. This could indicate that these regions are specifically influenced by LSD. It is interesting to note that the thalamic and striatal projections for the DMN, sensorimotor and frontoparietal networks observed in this study were relatively similar to the topography of cortical projections on these regions observed in several fMRI studies (Hale et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2012). However, the visual networks 1–3 and the auditory network did not follow this pattern, and occupied large portions of these subcortical structures The importance of hub lesions in brain disorders has recently been emphasized (Crossley et al., 2014). Alterations in thalamocortical FC have long been suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Lisman et al., 2010; Pinault, 2011; Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2011) and have been one of the few neuroimaging findings that have been repeatedly replicated in the search of the neural correlates of schizophrenia. Several studies indicated that FC between thalamus and frontal regions is decreased while FC between thalamus and sensorimotor areas is increased (for an overview see (Giraldo-Chica and Woodward, 2017)). It is remarkable that data-driven FC analysis in one of the biggest samples to date has identified alterations in thalamocortical FC as an outstanding characteristic of schizophrenia (Cheng et al., 2015). The findings reported by those authors very closely resemble those found in our data set (see Fig. 3) and, additionally to the thalamus, also comprise the pallidum and striatum. These observations might indicate that not only the thalamus but also the whole cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry is involved in altered brain functioning in schizophrenia as well as in altered states of consciousness induced by LSD, as has already suspected (Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008; Andreasen, 1999). Maybe these similarities could also explain why hallucinogenic drugs can induce psychotic episodes in vulnerable subjects (Vardy and Kay, 1983), rather than in the general population (Johansen and Krebs, 2015) as they might act on a system that is already impaired in patients in at-risk states of psychosis (Anticevic et al., 2015) On the other side, a recent model proposed that altered hub connectivity induced by hallucinogens might also explain their therapeutic effects (Nichols et al., 2016). Various studies have indicated that these substances might have beneficial effects in distinct mental disorders like depression, anxiety, and addiction. It is an interesting question, how a single mechanism of action can exert positive effects in heterogeneous diseases. Nichols et al. hypothesize that this link can be found in altered hub connectivity induced by these drugs. According to this model, pathological connectivity patterns associated with diverse mental diseases are acutely altered through destabilization of hub functions with subsequent changes in FC between various brain regions. These events somehow give rise to the development of new connectivity patterns which are stabilized after the acute effects have subsided, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects (Nichols et al., 2016) This study is limited by a relatively small sample size and the use of a moderately high dose of LSD. Functional MRI is only an indirect measure for neuronal activity and relies on neurovascular coupling. LSD might alter neurovascular coupling, as already reported for the related serotonergic drug psilocin (Spain et al., 2015). This might result in biased FC results (Liu, 2013). LSD-induced alterations in physiological parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure might also affect FC (Khalili-Mahani et al., 2013). We found no evidence for a systematic relationship between alterations in physiological parameters and functional connectivity in our data set. However, these measures were taken only at one time point before the fMRI scan and nuisance regression of continuously recorded parameters might have been preferable Furthermore, the fMRI environment might have negatively influenced subjective drug effects (Studerus et al., 2012). Although hallucinogenic drugs seem to mimic some symptoms present in schizophrenia (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al., 1998; Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Liechti, 2017), there are presumably also important differences. Firstly, negative symptoms as commonly seen in schizophrenia are probably not present to this extent with hallucinogens, which mainly induce effects similar to positive symptoms (De Gregorio et al., 2016). Secondly, there are also important differences among the positive symptoms, such as the predominance of visual hallucinations in hallucinogens compared to mainly auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. ICA results are influenced by the prespecified dimensionality (i.e. the prespecified number of components) (Ray et al., 2013). However, we restricted ICA to 20 components in order to allow direct comparison with established templates by Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2009) and with results from previous studies using LSD (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b) and psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2013).","In the search of neuronal correlates of altered states of consciousness induced by LSD, we could replicate previous findings describing decreased functional connectivity within RSNs. However, the relevance and specificity of these alterations for LSD-induced effects are questioned by lacking associations with subjective drug effects as well as very similar observations obtained after the administration of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In line with previous results, we found widely increased between-network connectivity. Closer inspection, however, indicated very little consistencies in altered FC between specific RSNs in our sample and previous findings in LSD and psilocybin. Therefore, it seems doubtful that one of these measures is a reliable and characteristic neuronal correlate of hallucinogenic drug effects. Importantly, our results indicated increased connectivity between networks and subcortical and cortical hub structures. This finding is in line with previous observations in psychopathological states, especially in psychosis. According to a recent model, altered hub connectivity might also explain improvements observed in various mental diseases after the administration of hallucinogens."
68,10.1038/s41583-020-0367-2,"Scientific interest in the effects of psychedelics has risen sharply in the past decade. Preclinical and clinical studies leveraging modern neuroscientific methods have produced various novel results with significant implications for understanding the neuropharmacology of human cognition, emotion and self-regulation, discovering potential trans-diagnostic treatment mechanisms in psychiatry and the development of novel rapid-acting and long-lasting treatment approaches Pharmacological challenge studies investigating the acute effects of single doses of psychedelics in healthy human participants have revealed important insights into the role of the 5-HT2A receptor in human cognition, emotion and self-regulation. These studies have shown that this specific receptor system is implicated in modulating social functioning, mood regulation and coherent self-representations. Importantly, these studies have also revealed the importance of targeting and studying specific sub-receptor systems to be able to conclusively understand human psychopharmacology and eventually be able to inform the development of new pharmacological therapeutics Recent neuroimaging studies have furthermore started to increase our understanding of the ways in which psychedelics temporarily change the functional architecture of the brain. Although different analytical approaches often limit the comparability between studies (see Box 2), some congruent patterns have started to emerge. Changes in functional and directed connectivity between the thalamus and cortical areas have been reported across different analysis techniques31,70,71. In addition, increased synchrony of sensory brain regions and decreased integrity of associative brain regions (including the DMN and the frontoparietal control network) have been reported after the administration of LSD, psilocybin and DMT31,78,79,83,86,87,89,96,153. However, it has to be noted that some of these effects are sensitive to GSR as outlined in Box 2. Increases in various measures of entropy and signal complexity have also been reported after the administration of LSD, psilocybin and DMT101,102,104,105,106. Other analytical approaches, such as the investigation of between-network connectivity during the resting state, have so far revealed inconsistent results or still need replication. These results support hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive but, rather, reflect different aspects of changes in neuronal dynamics. It is conceivable that future studies will reveal a more detailed (in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution) pattern of psychedelic-induced changes in brain connectivity that will allow one to better associate these neuronal effects with specific psychedelic-induced subjective experiences Studies of the effects of psychedelics in healthy participants have shown that these substances modulate a person’s self-focus, reduce negative emotional processing and strengthen social functioning12,120,138. Patients across different disorders who underwent treatment with psychedelics identified these effects as contributing to treatment success149,150. These experiences may therefore represent trans-diagnostic mechanisms for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses within and beyond the framework of psychedelic-assisted therapy. Additionally, preclinical results point to the potential of induced neuroplasticity as a promising neuronal mechanism that could be leveraged in psychotherapy Lastly, studies in patient populations show that psychedelics may constitute promising therapeutic agents that represent a novel treatment model in psychiatry: they have been shown to act rapidly and to have long-lasting effects after only a few doses. This is in stark contrast to the current treatment approaches in psychiatry, which usually consist of a regular intake of psychotropic medication. However, many open questions remain. The exact mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects are still not well understood and beneficial clinical results need to be replicated in larger trials. It is unclear whether the therapeutic effects of these substances are due to their direct effects on brain activity and connectivity or due to the cognitive and psychological experience of an altered state of consciousness. In other words, it is unclear whether the conscious experience of the psychedelic-induced subjective effects is necessary for therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the field still needs to uncover individual predictors or biomarkers of treatment efficacy. The impact of different approaches to accompanying psychotherapy will also require empirical investigation. Accompanying psychotherapy may turn out to be of critical importance, if the proposed neuroplastic effects of psychedelics indeed contribute to their clinical efficacy. Using psychedelics in a clinical setting can therefore be understood as pharmacologically assisted psychotherapy that leverages the molecular, systems-level and functional alterations induced by psychedelic substances.",
69,10.1073/pnas.1921475117,"Here, we have shown how a dynamic mutually coupled whole-brain model can address the major challenge in neuroscience, which is to explain the paradoxical flexibility of human brain function despite the reliance on a fixed anatomical connectome. One of the most important elements in this flexibility is the way that the fixed connectome can be modulated by neuromodulators to selectively change the balance of the excitation and inhibition of individual brain regions. Here, we modeled the dynamical mutual coupling between neuronal and neuromodulator systems at the whole-brain level. In particular, we implemented a mutually coupled dynamical system, which couples at the whole-brain level the neuronal system, which was modeled using a balanced dynamic mean field model (24, 25) and the neuromodulator system describing the dynamics of the neurotransmitter concentration levels (measured in vivo using PET) and modeled by the well-known Michaelis–Menten release-and-reuptake dynamics (26⇓–28). Here, as proof of principle, we consider the effects of psilocybin on the serotonin system and therefore use anatomical connectivity between the raphe nucleus and the rest of the brain to couple the two systems Overall, the results show that the interaction between these dynamical systems is fundamental for explaining the empirical data. In other words, the dynamic mutual interaction between neuronal and neuromodulator systems at the whole-brain level is important to fully explain the functional modulation of brain activity by psilocybin, a powerful psychedelic drug, acting on the serotonin system. This is especially important given the demonstrated ability of psilocybin to rebalance the human brain in treatment-resistant depression. The results provide evidence for how the integration of dMRI (anatomy), fMRI (functional neuronal activity), and PET (neurotransmitter system) at the whole-brain level is necessary for predicting properly brain dynamics as a result of the mutual coupling between a dual dynamical system. This expands on the rich existing experimental and theoretical research on the local effects of neurotransmitters Specifically, the results provide insights into the underlying dynamics of neurotransmission involved in psilocybin. In terms of dynamics, we first uncoupled the neuromodulators from the neuronal systems and found that this produced a highly significant breakdown in fitting the empirical data (Fig. 4A). We then ran further simulations to investigate the role of specific parts of the dynamic coupling. The full mutually coupled whole-brain model ran until a steady state was achieved, upon which we then froze the feedback dynamics from neuromodulators to neuronal system by removing coupling through the raphe nucleus. This again produced a highly significant breakdown in fitting the empirical data (Fig. 4B) In further sets of experiments designed to investigate the importance of the receptor distribution, we changed the distribution of regional receptor densities by 1) randomly shuffling the 5-HT2A (Fig. 4C) and 2) replacing them with those of other serotonin receptors, known to be much less sensitive to psilocybin, namely 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT4. Again, this produced a highly significant breakdown in the ability to explain the empirical data (Fig. 5B). This result confirms the crucial, causative role of the precise anatomical location and density of 5-HT2A Interestingly, as mentioned above, psilocybin has been demonstrated to play a role in rebalancing the human brain in treatment-resistant depression (19). The therapeutic action of psilocybin in depression is thought to depend on activation of serotonin 2A receptors, thereby initiating a multilevel plasticity (41). This is different from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are the most frequently prescribed antidepressant drug class and whose therapeutic action is thought to begin with reuptake blockade at the 5-HTT; psilocybin has no appreciable affinity or action at the 5-HTT. We were interested in further investigating this by replacing the receptor densities with the 5-HTT densities. We found that the fit with 5-HTT was significantly worse than 5-HT2A (Fig. 5C) and supports the potential for psilocybin in rebalancing brain function in treatment-resistant depression More broadly, the mutually coupled whole-brain model and results shed important light on our understanding of human brain function. Over the last decade, the discovery of whole-brain modeling has led to important new insights for explaining the principles of human brain function based on human neuroimaging data. The initial breakthrough was the recognition that the anatomical connectivity of the human brain shapes function at the whole-brain level (1, 2). However, it also became clear relatively quickly that this was a by-product of the close link between anatomy and function, given that it is possible to describe static spontaneous activity (i.e., grand average functional spatial connectivity over longer periods) even in the absence of neuronal dynamics, i.e., combining the underlying anatomy with noise (42). Still, it was shown by further investigations that capturing the dynamics of the spatiotemporal whole-brain activity requires more sophisticated dynamical modeling (3, 35, 43). All of these whole-brain studies were initially solely based on neuronal modeling, but recently it was shown that even better results can be obtained when the dynamics of the neuronal system (through the neuronal gain of excitatory neurons) is influenced by static neuromodulation Here, we have demonstrated the importance of having a biophysically realistic dynamic neuromodulator system, and more importantly the need for full mutual coupling between the full dynamics of both neuronal and neuromodulation systems. In other words, this framework for mutually coupled whole-brain modeling involves the underlying anatomical connectivity and two mutually interacting dynamical neuronal and neuromodulator systems Overall, the framework put forward here is likely to be essential for accurately modeling and explaining mechanisms of human brain function in health and disease. The framework combines multimodal neuroimaging from dMRI (anatomy), fMRI (functional neuronal activity), and PET (neurotransmitter system) at the whole-brain level. This offers unique opportunities for investigating how to rebalance human brain activity in disease through pharmacological manipulation that can be discovered and tested in silico in the mutually coupled whole-brain model proposed here. This whole-brain modeling can thus be used to make predictions that can be tested causally with electromagnetic stimulation (deep brain stimulation [DBS] and transcranial magnetic stimulation) or pharmacological interventions. In the future, this framework could further extended by measuring even faster whole-brain dynamics (measured with magnetoencephalography) (44) and incorporating gene expression at the whole-brain level, offering even more exciting avenues for discovering new and effective ways of rebalancing the human brain in disease.",
70,10.1080/09540261.2018.1481827,"Psychedelics produce a potent blockade of the inflammation produced by TNF-α in cell and animal models of inflammation. Because of TNF-α’s controversial role in asthma (Nakae et al., 2007) and (R)-DOI’s impact on numerous factors contributing to the differentiation of multiple immune cells (Kim, DeKruyff, & Umetsu, 2010; Moreira & Hogaboam, 2011), we believe that the effects of 5-HT2A receptor activation likely extend far beyond the mere blockade of TNF-α signalling. Given the select nature by which (R)-DOI only blocks sub-sets of pro-inflammatory mediator expression, psychedelics may modulate histone modifications and epigenetic signalling for their therapeutic effects. In asthma, an interplay between the acetylation and deacetylation states of histones in inflammatory genes has been well documented (Adcock, Tsaprouni, Bhavsar, & Ito, 2007; Cosio et al., 2004; Gunawardhana, Gibson, Simpson, Powell, & Baines, 2014; K. Ito et al., 2002). Furthermore, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown to reduce eosinophilic inflammation and AHR in mouse models of asthma (Choi et al., 2005; Ren et al., 2016). It is certainly plausible that 5-HT2A receptor activation modulates histone acetylation and methylation patterns to promote the expression of anti-inflammatory genes and repress the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Only recently has it been established that 5-HT2A receptor activity can alter epigenetic factors (Holloway & Gonzalez-Maeso, 2015) The remaining questions regarding psychedelics and inflammation include: do 5-HT2A agonists have more pronounced effects in some cell types more than others (i.e. do the anti-inflammatory effects manifest themselves more strongly in macrophages than eosinophils or Th2 cells)? Does 5-HT2A receptor activation modulate differentiation of immune-related cells to more anti-inflammatory phenotypes? What are the effects of chronic administration of a 5-HT2A agonist in peripheral tissues to treat immune-related disorders? Aside from these purely mechanistic questions, it is tempting to speculate on the nature of 5-HT2A receptor activation in other inflammatory disorders. Because 5-HT2A receptor activation impacts the expression of several key inflammatory mediators (Figure 2) and the variety of effects we have observed in animal models of inflammation, we believe that psychedelics may be of therapeutic value to a wide range of inflammatory disorders in humans. With regard to therapeutic aspects of psychiatric disorders like depression, putative suppression of neuroinflammation by psychedelics may play a key role in the long-term stability of the reported anti-depressant effects after a single treatment. Another putative component may be stimulation of neurogenesis. For example, the psychotropic ingredient of the Amazonian tea ayahuasca (Morales-García et al., 2017) can stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis, which has been shown to reduce depression-like behaviours (Hill, Sahay, & Hen, 2015). Although the use of sub-behavioural levels of psychedelics remains to be validated as an effective therapeutic strategy for inflammation in humans, the data from cellular and animal models is promising, and these agents represent small molecule, highly bioavailable, inexpensive, and steroid sparing treatments for inflammatory-related diseases like asthma, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. One possible barrier to the development of psychedelics for use in the clinic is that the majority are scheduled and controlled substances in the United States and several other countries. Nevertheless, drugs that activate the 5-HT2A receptor and that have been shown to produce psychedelic effects in humans have been FDA approved (e.g. lorcaserin). Although the results we discuss here are promising, more research is needed to fully unlock therapeutic potentials and to discover molecular mechanisms underlying their effects Figure 2. 5-HT2A receptor activation represses the expression of inflammatory mediators in multiple tissues. Mice treated with (R)-DOI have been shown to have suppressed cytokine and chemokine expression following TNF-α-stimulation (aortic arch, small intestine) and ovalbumin challenge (lung). Intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is found on the surface of endothelial and smooth muscle cells and contributes to the inflammatory response by promoting the adhesion of immune cells onto the endothelial surface, allowing for their subsequent infiltration into peripheral tissues. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 is also found on the surface of endothelial cells and serves as a scaffold for leukocyte migration via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants. TNF-α is a key mediator in the inflammatory response and activates numerous pro-inflammatory signal transduction pathways. IL-5 is a Th2-derived cytokine that promotes prolonged eosinophil survival. Granulocye-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is secreted by macrophages and recruits immune cells (i.e. eosinophils) to inflammation sites and induces their differentiation to pro-inflammatory phenotypes. Together the action of 5-HT2A agonists on these inflammatory markers indicate therapeutic value for a number of disorders, including asthma, atherosclerosis, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and even depression",
71,10.1016/j.jad.2019.07.076,"Ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD are classical psychedelics being studied as potentially therapeutic agents to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with life-threatening disease. Therefore, the present systematic review aimed to determine their efficacy, tolerability and mechanisms of action. The main findings were that psychedelics produced significant anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects with good tolerability response. These results, in addition to the putative mechanisms of action underlying their beneficial effects, will be further discussed below In all studies, psychedelic administration caused statistically significant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings corroborate the limited previous research conducted in animal studies and healthy volunteers, as well as anecdotal evidence describing improved mood and reduced feelings of apprehension following psychedelic administration (Riba et al., 2001, Hilber and Chapillon, 2005, Farzin and Mansouri, 2006, Fortunato et al., 2009, Fortunato et al., 2010aa, Fortunato et al., 2010b, Santos et al., 2007, Griffiths et al., 2008, Kast, 1967, Richards et al., 1977). These improvements were consistently observed across a variety of rating scales, and this is suggestive of a genuine therapeutic effect rather than a specific scale's tendency to show a positive effect. Moreover, the lack of equivalent symptom reduction in control patients indicates that the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects can be attributed to psychedelic intervention. Participants also described the experience as spiritually meaningful, resulting in decreased disease-related demoralisation and hopelessness as well as improved quality of life (Ross et al., 2016, Griffiths et al., 2016, Grob et al., 2011, G et al., 2014) Psychedelics’ ability to provide acute symptom relief, within one day, is advantageous when compared to current antidepressants, which take several weeks to work. This is because antidepressants’ delayed therapeutic effects can lead to non-compliance and contribute to increased morbidity (Machado-Vieira et al., 2010, Tylee and Walters, 2007). Moreover, since psychedelics’ beneficial effects are maintained with impressive response rates for several months, this could imply that less frequent administration is required compared to typical pharmacotherapy for anxiety and depression. This, coupled to the fact that exposure to treatment is monitored, could help to overcome treatment-resistance stemming from non-compliance Psychedelic treatment was generally well-tolerated. The commonest adverse effects included transient anxiety, headaches, nausea and vomiting. These were generally self-resolving except for three patients on LSD requiring benzodiazepines to counteract treatment-induced anxiety and/or emotional distress. One of these patients had received the placebo-like low-dose of LSD, suggesting that the need for tranquilising medication was also dependent on individual susceptibility in addition to dose-related drug factors. Vomiting was considered cathartic and thus an integral component of the therapeutic experience (Osório et al., 2015). Nevertheless, ways to manage it such as by pre-medicating with an anti-emetic can be explored. LSD-induced paranoia, illusions and feeling cold were predictable side effects and may be explained by its superior hallucinogenic strength compared to psilocybin and ayahuasca (D et al., 2016, Schmid et al., 2015). All psychedelics also increased heart rate and blood pressure. The statistically significant elevations reported by Grob et al. and Ross et al. with psilocybin may have been confounded by niacin's ability to acutely lower blood pressure through vasodilation in the controls (Bays and Rader, 2009). Nevertheless, medical intervention was never required Previous research has shown these compounds to be relatively safe when used in medically-controlled environments (Guimarães dos Santos, 2013, J et al., 2008, Nichols, 2004). They have no reported risk of dependence as daily administration causes serotonin (5-HT2A) receptor downregulation, leading to rapid induction of tolerance (Nichols, 2004). In fact, they may even have anti-addictive properties (B et al., 2015, J et al., 2014). Concerns over their impact on mental health have been challenged by large-scale population studies showing that psychedelic users have lower rates of psychological distress and suicidality compared to individuals who had never used psychedelics but an equivalent amount of other recreational drugs (Hendricks et al., 2015, Krebs and Johansen, 2013). Although the observational nature of these studies cannot establish causality, it suggests that psychedelics are not counter-productive over time. However, the findings of this research need to be considered in light of certain limitations. Only seven studies were included in this review, each with a small sample size (range 6–51 subjects), and a higher proportion of females, particularly Caucasian, among the cohort. These factors limit the generalisability of the results. Additionally, the significant level of bias present across the studies (Fig. 3a/b) affects the reliability of the conclusions. Three studies were open-label proof-of-concept studies, recruiting patients largely by self-referral who are possibly more inclined to endorse the positive effects of psychedelics. The fact that patients are aware of receiving the active drug could introduce expectancy bias, whereby they anticipate a beneficial effect. The double-blind randomised nature of the other four studies served to minimise this predisposition. However, even in these instances maintaining blinding proved challenging, as the drugs’ psychoactive effects were florid, with patients experiencing a heightened state of consciousness with marked emotional accompaniments. Administering active placebos in the form of niacin or very low-dose psychedelic was an attempt to overcome this, as these would induce mild physiological and/or psychological effects but would be incapable of substantially facilitating the therapeutic process. When the psychedelic was administered to both study groups, this also permitted study investigators to instruct patients in such a way as to reduce expectancy bias i.e. that everyone would receive the drug, albeit different doses. Nevertheless, it is likely that patients were usually unblinded by their experience on the active drug. Psychedelics are also known to promote suggestibility, which might have further enhanced positive outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., 2015). The influence of these would be difficult to avoid in judging outcomes, especially since the scales used to measure efficacy are largely subjective. Therefore, at least inclusion of blinded clinician-raters is necessary in future studies. Additionally, more objective outcome parameters are possible and should be considered. For example, geolocation from mobile phones can be measured, as amount of time spent at home correlates with depression severity (Palmius et al., 2017). In cancer patients, treatment efficacy could also be reflected in patients’ increased adherence to treatment or reduced need for narcotic pain-relief (Grof et al., 1973). Future trials could also address the role of expectancy and suggestibility by measuring and controlling for these variables. For example, patients could be asked about their pre-treatment expectations, and outcomes from self-referred patients could be compared with those from patients referred by clinicians. If expectancy and suggestibility are found to be influential, they could be treated as exploitable components of the treatment model rather than confounding variables (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016) Limitations also exist in treating participants with grave somatic diseases in clinical trials. This is because improvements or deteriorations in their illness can impact psychological parameters independent of therapeutic intervention. Additionally, patients who become too ill to continue or pass away during the course of the experiment contribute to missing data. These factors can introduce bias in the results and affect the overall evidence base for psychedelics’ therapeutic potential In terms of methodology, accepting only English citations with full publication access may have introduced a minor degree of publication bias (Pilkington et al., 2005). Moreover, the subjective nature of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool may have caused inaccuracies in the bias assessment results. Considering that inter-assessor agreement can be inconsistent (Armijo-Olivo et al., 2014, Armijo-Olivo et al., 2012, Savović et al., 2014), inclusion of multiple reviewers would strengthen its validity as any discrepancies would be discussed. Before widespread use of psychedelics can be contemplated, there are several challenges that future research needs to address. Firstly, the aforementioned promising results need to be replicated in larger-scale trials with more participants. Ideally, these studies would also be longer in duration to determine long-term safety and efficacy. Although observational studies have provided some evidence that long-term psychedelic use is not harmful (Guimarães dos Santos, 2013, Bouso et al., 2012, Barbosa et al., 2016, Barbosa et al., 2012, Hendricks et al., 2015, Krebs and Johansen, 2013), the inherent limitations of these studies call for more robust long-term clinical trials to be carried out. It must be recognised that despite clinical interest in psychedelics resuming, regulatory obstacles still exist, therefore performing such research is not straightforward (Nutt et al., 2013). Nevertheless, future questions to be answered include whether repeated administration for long-term treatment is possible and how frequently it should be done Alongside these, optimum dosing must be determined, and target population identified. For example, Griffiths et al. reduced the psilocybin dose once the trial had commenced because there were concerns over the high dose causing too psychologically challenging experiences, and the low dose producing psychoactive effects, thus not serving as an appropriate placebo-like control (Griffiths et al., 2016). Protocol amendments like this are less than ideal, therefore defining correct dosing is key. Regarding target population, it is necessary to identify whether this treatment should only be considered for individuals with depression and anxiety that are non-responsive to other treatment methods, or whether it could be prophylactic for patients with severe symptoms. This is relevant as long-term antidepressant use can obstruct the potential therapeutic action of psychedelics (Bonson et al., 1996). As it is unclear whether a wash-out period would be enough to negate this effect, it seems worthwhile to avoid delaying psychedelic treatment too long. Additionally, treating cancer-related psychological distress with psychedelics is desirable, however in reality it is limited by a variety of exclusion criteria. Patients may also be reluctant to participate in such an intervention as high doses have sometimes been associated with transient episodes of psychological distress or anxiety (G et al., 2011, Griffiths et al., 2006, Griffiths et al., 2016) It would also be necessary to determine an early proximal end-point to prove initial impact of treatment. As previously mentioned, several studies have shown that the intensity of the subjective mystical experience was correlated with long-term clinical outcomes (Ross et al., 2016, Griffiths et al., 2016, Carhart-Harris et al., 2018, Grof et al., 1973, Roseman et al., 2017, Pahnke, 1969, C-H et al., 2017). Hence, this could serve as a useful early predictor of treatment response, but first it needs to be further explored and better defined Finally, cost-effectiveness must be established. The fact that psychological support or at least a supportive environment are required every time could be a major limitation (Johnson et al., 2008). In light of this, future research needs to determine the relative therapeutic contribution of psychotherapy as part of the treatment model. The results presented herein indicate that psychedelics caused comparable anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects when administered with and without formal psychological intervention. Although the high degree of heterogeneity among studies limits this interpretation, it suggests that providing a supportive environment may be enough. Understanding whether this is the case is important, as minimising therapy requirement is desirable to reduce costs, however such therapy minimisation should not compromise treatment efficacy or jeopardise patient safety. Overall, the direct medical costs need to be balanced against the social and economic costs of illness (C-H et al., 2017).","The present review looked at classical psychedelics for the treatment of depression and anxiety associated with life-threatening disease. It found that, in a supportive setting, ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD consistently produced significant and sustained anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects. Psychedelic treatment was generally well-tolerated with no persisting adverse effects. Regarding their mechanisms of action, they mediate their main therapeutic effects biochemically via serotonin receptor agonism, and psychologically by generating meaningful psycho-spiritual experiences that contribute to mental flexibility Given the limited success rates of current treatments for anxiety and mood disorders, and considering the high morbidity associated with these conditions, there is potential for psychedelics to provide symptom relief in patients inadequately managed by conventional methods. The novelty of this research means that before psychedelics’ wider-use can be contemplated, the results presented herein need to be replicated in larger studies with a longer follow-up to determine lasting efficacy and safety. Moreover, the role of psychotherapy as an adjunct to psychedelic treatment should be better explored. Ultimately, this would help to improve the care of patients suffering from depression and anxiety."
72,10.1038/s41598-017-06854-0,"Our results reveal that the entropy increases after Ayahuasca ingestion. The following also increase: geodesic distance, clustering coefficient and local efficiency. However, the global efficiency decreases. Overall, we find an increase of local integration and a decrease of global integration in the functional brain networks We interpret these findings in the context of some well understood prototypical classes of networks. Regular lattices have fixed coordination number, hence all nodes have the same degree and the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution is thus zero. In contrast, the entropy is high in networks with broad distributions of degree. The observed increase in entropy after Ayahuasca ingestion indicates that the degree distribution becomes broader. In the context of the Watts-Strogatz model59, clustering and geodesic distance both decrease when highly regular networks are transformed into small-world networks by randomly re-assigning the links. Whereas clustering and geodesic distances decrease with increasing randomness in such models, we find the opposite behavior for Ayahuasca, i.e., randomness as measured by the Shannon entropy of the node degree distribution increases in parallel with clustering and geodesic distances. Hence, our findings cannot be reduced to simple explanations of greater or lesser randomness. Locally, there is an increase in integration (as measured by network efficiency), but globally there is a decrease in integration. Indeed the increase of geodesic distance and decrease of global efficiency after Ayahuasca intake signify that the functional brain networks are less globally integrated. One possible interpretation of these findings is that the increase of local robustness and the decrease of global integration reflect a variation in modular structure of the network. Recent studies have reported the presence of modularity in functional brain networks on several scales50, 60, 61. Modular networks are characterized by the existence of reasonably well-defined subnetworks in which internal connections are denser than connections between distinct subnetworks50. However, traditional algorithms62,63,64 were not able to detect variation on modular structure features between our sets of networks Our results are broadly consistent with the entropic brain hypothesis, hence we discuss the latter in the context of our findings. The hypothesis maintains that the mental state induced by psychedelics, which the original authors term “primary-state,” presents relatively elevated entropy in some features of brain organization, compared to the ordinary waking state (termed “secondary”)11. Although it may be somewhat counter-intuitive that the psychedelic state is considered primary while ordinary consciousness is secondary, their hypothesis is inherently plausible considering that a wider spectrum of experiences is possible with psychedelics than in ordinary consciousness. In this sense, ordinary consciousness can be thought of as a restriction or constrained special case of a more primary consciousness. The hypothesized lower entropy of ordinary consciousness relative to primary consciousness is attributed to this reduction of freedom. In fact, the idea that ordinary consciousness is not primary was previously put forth by Alan Watts to describe what later became widely known as mindfulness 65. (We emphasize that the terms “primary” and “secondary” are used not as value judgements, but rather to denote temporal order, i.e. the order of appearance, both evolutionarily as well as in the maturation of a healthy individual) More specifically, we believe that the observed increase in entropy may be related to the temporary removal of the some of the restrictions that are necessary for sustaining ordinary (adult trained) consciousness. With these restrictions temporarily gone, the entropy increases and the mind may become effectively more “free”, attaining a more flexible state in which self-referential narratives and thoughts about the past or the future are no longer mentally identified with the reality that they represent. We emphasize, however, that “correlation is not causation” and that the entropy increases may occurr in parallel with the loss of constraints, rather than bear a direct causal relation to them. These ideas are further explored in the Supplementary Discussion (see also refs. [80,81,82,83]) Relatively few studies have investigated entropy in brain functional networks, hence additional comments are in order. Tagliazucchi et al.14 showed that psilocybin (psychedelic present in some species of mushrooms) may be responsible for increases of a different entropy measure in functional connectivity of the 4 regions of Default Mode Network (DMN), a relevant functional network related to resting state. Recently, Yao et al.66 correlated entropy increases in the human brain with age. This study also supports the view that entropy is correlated to brain function (and perhaps also its development). Moreover, in agreement with our results, a study by Schröter et al.4 similarly suggests that functional network topology may have a central role in consciousness quality. They investigated the effects on the human brain of the anesthetic propofol, which can induce loss of consciousness67. They reported a decrease of the clustering coefficient, which is strongly influenced by degree distribution (however, geodesic distance remained unchanged). Very recently, Lebedev et al.15 and separately Schartner et al.16 have reported evidence of increases in measures of entropy, the former with LSD and the latter with LSD, psilocybin and ketamine We briefly comment on the limitations of our method: (i) the reduced number of subjects and the fact that all of them were experienced with Ayahuasca do not allow population inferences and do not elucidate whether the effects observed here were only due the acute administration or if previous experience also played a significant role; (ii) expectancy and suggestion were not controlled, as placebo was not used; (iii) networks were built upon a number of critical choices, such as the atlas used to partition the brain, the method used to build the correlation matrix, and the cutoff thresholds for generating the adjacency matrices from correlation matrices68, 69, which may affect the final results; (iv) the chosen range of correlation values automatically limits the networks’ behavior to a small-world network. Despite this limitation, it is important to highlight that several studies have consistently demonstrated that brain networks exhibit a small-world behavior Finally, we speculate about whether or not our finding of larger mean geodesic distances may have any relation to self-reports of “mind-expansion” by users of psychedelics (see also ref. 16). Could there be a direct relation between entropy increases and the higher creativity reported by users of psychedelics? Such questions merit further investigation. In conclusion, our results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that psychedelics increase the entropy in brain functions. By calculating the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution of complex networks generated from fMRI data, we have taken a new low-computational-cost approach to investigating brain function under the influence of psychedelics",
73,10.1093/nc/nix016,"Dennett (1992) famously argued that the self is a ‘centre of narrative gravity’ akin to the centre of gravity of an object: an abstraction, but no less real or predictively useful for that. On the predictive coding construal of the integrative self, the self-model functions as a centre of representational gravity—not just in narrative processes but also in lower-level affective, bodily, and spatial processes. It is a representation of the ′point′ around which everything else revolves. But crucially, it is not a representation as of a mere point, but as of a particular. This is why we reject Dennett’s metaphysics of selfhood, as well as Hohwy and Michael’s claim that the self-model has enough of the right attributes to qualify as a self If our conjectures are right, the content of the self-model is Cartesian: it is of a substance or an entity which has the properties and experiences. And here we agree with Metzinger that there ‘is just no entity there, no individual substance, and scientifically we can predict and explain everything we want to predict and explain in a much more parsimonious way’ (quoted in Marshall 2016). Thus, our view is structurally analogous to Mackie’s (1977) error theory of morality, conjoining the psychosemantic claim that the self-representation is as of a Cartesian substance with the ontological claim that no such substance exists. It is also substantially similar to Metzinger’s views about the self-model, developed in the context of a specific case and a mechanistic proposal (self-binding on predictive processing principles) about how the model performs its adaptive functions for the organism All of this fits smoothly with the idea that the DMN and SLN implement narrative and embodied aspects of self-representation, respectively. The self-representation as we conceive it serves as an organizing principle at different levels and in different domains of processing. Perceptual representations are organized in an egocentric space; interoceptive representations are interpreted as signals of adaptively relevant events or ‘core relational themes’ (Prinz 2004); and narratives are structured around the fortunes and prospects of a protagonist. At all levels, salience is attributed, attention directed, and information integrated in accordance with the relevance of information to the organism’s goals. As James Kingsland (2016, 209) puts it, ‘we have evolved into an ape that takes things personally",
74,10.1016/j.jcbs.2019.11.004,"The present retrospective cross-sectional survey study examined whether psychedelic occasioned mystical-type or psychological insight experiences predicted decreases in depression and anxiety following a psychedelic experience (H1), acute psychedelic effects predicted increases in psychological flexibility (H2), increases in psychological flexibility predicted decreases in depression/anxiety, (H3) and whether increases in psychological flexibility mediated the relationships between acute psychedelic effects and decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms (H4). Findings from our regression and path analysis models supported each of these hypotheses. Consistent with prior studies (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016; Davis et al, 2019), in the present study mystical experiences were associated with decreases in depression and anxiety. Importantly, these observations were extended by showing that experiences of psychological insight during a psychedelic experience are also associated with decreases in depression and anxiety. Further, when mystical and psychological insight effects were included simultaneously as predictors of changes in our models, results showed that psychological insight stands out as a more robust predictor of change, as evidenced by the larger direct (Insight: β=.46 versus Mystical: β=.09) and indirect (Insight: β=.29 versus Mystical: β=.06) coefficients in the path analysis. That psychological insight is strongly related to decreases in depression and anxiety is perhaps not surprising given the history of insight-oriented therapies (Connolly Gibbons et al., 2007), but it has also been questioned whether gaining insight is sufficient in and of itself to produce lasting changes in behavior or mental health functioning (Kuncewicz, Lachowicz-Tabaczek, and Zaluski, 2014; Leichsenring et al., 2006). To this point, our models also showed that psychological insight was predictive of change when accounting for the correlation between insight and mystical experiences. Insightful as well as mystical-type experiences have been identified as subtypes of the phenomenon of quantum change, which refers to a sudden, distinctive, benevolent, and enduring experience resulting in personal transformations that affect a broad range of personal emotions, cognitions and behaviors (Miller and C’de Baca, 2001). Such experiences after taking a psychedelic have also been implicated in decreases in alcohol use among individuals with alcohol use disorder (GarciaRomeu et al., 2019). Furthermore, findings from the present study underscore a potential explanation for how acute psychedelic experiences, including gaining psychological insight and mystical experiences, may exert such changes. Specifically, we demonstrated the importance of increases in psychological flexibility as a mediator of the positive therapeutic effects. Although several other mechanisms have been proposed at various levels of functioning, from changes in the entropy of brain network connectivity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014) to the importance of awe/ego dissolution (Hendricks, 2018; Preller & Vollenweider, 2018), findings from this study are consistent with evidence demonstrating that psychedelic effects are associated with changes in psychological flexibility among a small sample of subjects who use the psychedelic ayahuasca (Kuypers et al., 2016), and research showing that increases in psychological flexibility is associated with positive depression and anxiety outcomes (Twohig & Levin, 2017). Although the exploration of potential mediators of psychedelic effects on therapeutic outcomes is in its early stages, if psychological flexibility emerges as a consistent and robust mediator of effects in prospective clinical trials, then the field of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy should consider integrating psychedelic administration with contextual behavioral therapies (e.g., ACT; Hayes et al., 2006) or other therapies designed to target psychological flexibility. Such therapies are designed to enhance processes of change by supporting increases in psychological flexibility which could be enhanced through the administration of a psychedelic. Moreover, it is possible that some acute psychedelic effects overlap with the core processes of the ACT model of psychopathology (Hayes et al., 2006). For example, consistent with the core processes of ACT, qualitative analysis of first-hand accounts of tobacco smokers in a clinical trial examining the effect of psilocybin-assisted therapy (Noorani et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2014), suggested that their psychedelic experiences helped them see themselves in the context of their addiction (i.e., self as context), realize that they are not the labels (e.g., smoker) which they previously identified as (i.e., defusion), understood their values more clearly than before (i.e., values), and connected with the fullness of the present moment and their experience of it (i.e., contact with the present moment). Although not highlighted in the qualitative reports per se, another component of the ACT model, committed action, was demonstrated in the clinical trial by the high rates (80%) of biologically verified abstinence at 6 months post-treatment (Johnson et al., 2014). These data suggest that psychedelics appear to occasion both mindfulness/ acceptance processes as well as commitment and behavior change processes. However, more research is needed to systematically investigate these processes in rigorous longitudinal trials among individuals with depression or anxiety in order to replicate these findings in this population. This study has several limitations. Internet-based recruitment and data collection procedures were anonymous. Although this likely increased participation from individuals from a variety of geographical locations, it would have excluded people who prefer not to participate in research conducted on the internet. Further, a limitation of survey methods is that all reports are retrospective, increasing the likelihood that current affect and personality bias could influence recollection of subjective psychedelic experiences as well as depression and anxiety symptoms that were experienced many years ago. However, this potential confound is not expected to be more or less than similar confounds in other retrospective survey research (Davis et al., 2018; Davis et al, 2019). Additionally, the parent study from which the data were drawn, was designed to investigate the acute effect of gaining insight during a psychedelic experience. Although the mean score of the intensity of mystical experiences in this sample was similar to prior studies (Davis et al., 2018), suggesting comparably strong mystical effects in addition to insight effects, we cannot rule out the possibility that recruiting people who specifically reported gaining insight as part of a psychedelic experience accounts for some of the differential strength in the association between acute insight and other study variables. Another limitation to this study is that, despite our efforts to recruit individuals with diverse backgrounds by placement of notices on a variety of internet forums, respondents were primarily young, white, and male. Although our sample is consistent with prior studies of psychedelic users using similar recruitment procedures (Davis et al., 2018; Barret et al., 2016), similar to Michaels et al. (2018) we strongly encourage future researchers to continue efforts in recruiting a diverse sample. There are several possible explanations for the lack of diverse representation in psychedelic survey studies. For example, it could be that the topic of these studies are not interesting to some potential respondents, that there is a perceived risk involved with reporting an illegal behavior, or that the internet computer format excluded individuals from differing socio-economic backgrounds. Efforts to overcome these factors could include a community-based participatory research methodology (Israel et al., 2005), wherein the study is designed through engagement with leaders from a variety of diverse backgrounds, with the intention of better understanding the ways in which the study can be designed to connect with individuals from these communities","The findings from the present study highlight the role of psychological flexibility as a mediator of acute psychedelic effects and depression/anxiety outcomes. Future studies should examine the effect of psychedelic drug administration on psychological flexibility in a laboratory setting using a controlled trial design in order to ascertain the causal influences of psychological processes that predict therapeutic effects of hallucinogens. Such work should include measurement of the core processes of ACT (e.g., defusion, values, self as context, etc.) in order to examine whether changes in these core processes occur and predict enduring effects of psychedelic substances on therapeutic outcomes. If psychological flexibility continues to be shown to mediate positive therapeutic outcomes, future research should explore whether such therapeutic effects can be further enhanced by using a psychotherapeutic approach to psychedelic-assisted therapy that specifically targets processes of change within a transdiagnostic psychological flexibility model."
75,10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00692,"Several clinical studies have demonstrated that acute, hallucinogenic doses of psychedelic compounds can produce rapid, long-lasting changes in mood and behavior in humans. (43−45) Recent data also suggests that a single hallucinogenic dose of DMT can change rodent brain structure and behavior long after the drug has been cleared from the body. (16,24) Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that a nonhallucinogenic 1 mg/kg dose of DMT leads to increased frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in layer V pyramidal neurons of the PFC 24 h after administration. (16) Therefore, we hypothesized that administering DMT on a chronic, intermittent, low dose regimen—similar to psychedelic microdosing—might alter behavior To the best of our knowledge, there has only been one peer-reviewed scientific report on the effects of psychedelic microdosing in rodents. This study employed three doses of psilocin spaced over 6 days, with behavioral testing occurring 48 h after the final dose. (46) In agreement with our findings, the authors report no statistically significant changes in EPM behavior when two-tailed statistical tests were employed. The distinct lack of robust anxiogenic-like effects following chronic, intermittent, low doses of psychedelics is striking when compared to the effects of acute high doses. A hallucinogenic dose of DMT (10 mg/kg) decreases exploratory behavior in the NIL paradigm (i.e., both locomotion and rearing), decreases the number of open arm entries in the EPM, and increases freezing behavior immediately following the administration of foot shocks. (24) None of these effects are observed when a subhallucinogenic dose (1 mg/kg) of DMT is administered on a chronic intermittent schedule (Figures 2 and 3c) Unlike the anxiogenic-like effects produced by an acute hallucinogenic dose of DMT, the beneficial effects on fear extinction learning and forced swim behavior (24) are reproduced by the chronic, intermittent low dose regimen (Figures 3f and 4). These antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects are consistent with the anecdotal human reports regarding psychedelic microdosing providing strong supporting evidence that psychedelic microdosing might actually have therapeutic potential. Compounds capable of enhancing fear extinction learning in rodents, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), (47,48) are excellent candidates for treating PTSD symptoms in humans We hypothesize that chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT increase the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC that project to the basolateral amygdala and dorsal raphe nucleus to decrease the expression of conditioned fear responses and increase swimming behavior in the forced swim test, respectively. DMT and other psychedelics are potent psychoplastogens—compounds capable of promoting the rapid growth of dendritic branches, spines, and synapses—due to their ability to stimulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through activation of 5-HT2A receptors. (16) These receptors are enriched in the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain that is known to exert top-down control over mood and anxiety. It is likely that the behavioral changes induced by chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT are the result of positive neuroadaptations in circuits involving the PFC that are relevant to fear extinction (22) and effortful response to behavioral challenge (i.e., FST) (21) as DMT has an extremely short half-life in rats (ca. 15 min) (49) and the behaviors were performed on days when DMT was NOT administered. In fact, we have previously shown that a 1 mg/kg dose of DMT increases the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs in the PFC long after DMT had been cleared from the body. Despite producing similar anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like behavioral effects, an acute hallucinogenic dose and chronic, intermittent, low doses of DMT produce very different biochemical and structural phenotypes. We have previously shown that a single hallucinogenic dose of DMT (10 mg/kg) increases dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons of the PFC, (16) but a similar effect was not observed following administration of chronic, intermittent low doses (1 mg/kg) of DMT (Figure 5). We hypothesize that chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT promote sufficient plasticity to strengthen key circuits involved in the regulation of mood and fear, thus impacting behavior, but that homeostatic plasticity tightly controls the overall synaptic input to these neurons leading to similar spine densities between treatment groups over time While there were no major behavioral differences between male and female rats following DMT treatment, there were distinct changes in neuronal structure. Dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons of the PFC was unchanged in male rats administered chronic, intermittent, low doses of DMT; however, female rats exhibited a reduction in spine density (Figure 5). As psychedelics are known to increase glutamate release in the cortex, (50) the reduced spine density observed in females could reflect greater sensitivity to glutamatergic excitotoxicity. This highlights the fact that the overall psychedelic microdosing load, which includes the amount of drug in each dose, the frequency of administration, and the length of treatment, is likely to be critical for achieving the beneficial effects of psychedelic microdosing without negative repercussions. Long-term intermittent use of ayahuasca is correlated with thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in humans, (51) but not increased risk for mental illness. (52) However, Nichols and co-workers have shown that chronic (>3 months), intermittent, high doses of LSD administered to rats produce neuroadaptations leading to a persistent behavioral state consisting of hyperactivity, anhedonia, and social deficits. (53) These behavioral changes are accompanied by significant gene expression changes in the PFC related to neural plasticity. (35) As a similar dose of LSD given over 11 days resulted in antidepressant-like effects, (54) it appears that the total length of treatment is critical for determining behavioral outcomes A single hallucinogenic dose of several psychedelic compounds has been shown to increase gene expression of several genes related to neural plasticity. (55,56) However, we did not observe similar changes following the administration of chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT (Figure 6). Duman and co-workers also observed that repeated dosing of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), an amphetamine-based psychedelic, caused minimal changes in BDNF expression in the cortex when compared to a single acute dose. They hypothesized that 5-HT2 downregulation might explain the differences observed between the two dosing regimens. However, in the case of chronic, intermittent administration of low dose DMT, we do not observe any changes in HTR2A expression (Figure 6), and it has been previously shown that DMT does not induce receptor downregulation in cellular studies, (57) nor does it cause tolerance in humans. (58) This distinct lack of increased BDNF expression following chronic, intermittent, low doses of DMT highlights an important mechanistic difference between psychedelic microdosing and chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other slow-acting antidepressants. In the latter case, increased BDNF expression is believed to facilitate the repair of damaged circuits relevant to mood and anxiety. (59) Chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT appear to accomplish this without any obvious changes in the expression of BDNF or other genes known to be differentially regulated following administration of a single high dose of a psychedelic","In addition to neurobiologial effects, psychedelic microdosing might also impact metabolism. After correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, male rats administered chronic, intermittent low doses of DMT exhibited a trend toward eating less food (p = 0.13, Figure S3c). Similar effects have been observed following administration of ayahuasca (60) and various serotonergic agonists. (61) Surprisingly, despite eating less food than vehicle-treated controls, the DMT-treated animals gained significantly more weight (Figure S3b). This contrasted with a previous report of chronic ayahuasca administration in rats, (60) and the reason for the discrepancy is not immediately obvious. Metabolomics experiments revealed that serum levels of most steroids remained unchanged following psychedelic microdosing. However, male rats treated with DMT did experience a nearly 50% reduction in estradiol levels, though the effect was not significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing In general, more work needs to be done to identify potential risks associated with the increasingly popular practice of psychedelic microdosing. While psychedelic-induced activation of mTOR in young adults might lead to changes in neural plasticity having beneficial effects on mood and anxiety, in some individuals, psychedelic microdosing could cause overstimulation of cortical neurons and actually exacerbate symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, nothing is known about the effects of psychedelic microdosing on neurodevelopment or the aging brain. As overactivation of mTOR has been proposed to contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (62) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), (63) more research is warranted to fully understand the risks associated with the chronic, intermittent use of psychedelics and related psychoplastogens While our study only assessed the impact of a single low dose of DMT administered on a chronic, intermittent schedule, it is important because it provides critical information about which behaviors are sensitive to psychedelic microdosing, and which are not, for both males and females. Moreover, it accomplished this using the minimal number of animals possible—an important ethical consideration. Follow-up studies can now hone in on particular behaviors of interest (e.g., FST or fear extinction) and perform dose–response or time–response studies. We still do not know if (1) lower doses would maintain therapeutic efficacy while minimizing changes in spine density or other potential side effects, or (2) if more complex dose–response relationships (e.g., U-shaped) are operative. Future studies examining dose–response effects and the impact of different dosing schedules are certainly warranted Despite the potential risks associated with psychedelic microdosing, the data presented here suggest several exciting possibilities for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. First, a chronic intermittent dosing regimen lends itself to the potential prophylactic treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. As acute doses of serotonergic psychedelics produce similar effects as an acute dose of the psychoplastogen ketamine, and ketamine has demonstrated promise for preventing stress-induced depression- and anxiety-related phenotypes in animal models, (64−66) it will be interesting to see if psychedelic microdosing is also capable of preventing the development of depression and anxiety symptoms. Second, the ability of low doses of DMT to produce positive effects on mood and anxiety in rats suggests that the perceptual effects of psychedelics can be decoupled from their therapeutic properties. This could lead to the development of nonhallucinogenic psychoplastogens with broad therapeutic potential and minimal risk for abuse. Taken together, our results encourage cautious optimism about the potential for psychedelic microdosing to produce beneficial effects on depression and anxiety"
76,10.1021/acsptsci.0c00194,"Based on the results from experimental studies of moderate to high dose psychedelics we believe that the case for subjective effects playing a major role in enduring beneficial effects is compelling. Across a number of studies, when the intensity of the subjective psychedelic effect is controlled, certain subjective effects predict desirable outcomes. Underlying neurobiological-based mechanisms are undoubtedly necessary but likely not sufficient to confer full beneficial effects. In the nonsubjective anesthesia test that we describe, we would not be surprised to see some therapeutic effects but that they would be of lower magnitude and/or more transient. We suspect that the proportion of the long-term beneficial outcomes that are mediated through subjective effects is substantial, accounting for the majority of the lasting beneficial effects of psychedelics. For an alternative perspective, please see a companion Viewpoint in this issue","Although preliminary, the foregoing experimental observations make a case that some subjective effects occasioned by moderate to high doses of psychedelics play a key role in their enduring beneficial effects. It is our contention that the only definitive study to disprove the importance of such subjective effects would be one in which a psychedelic was administered to individuals who were rendered fully unconscious (e.g., via deep anesthesia) and who subsequently reported no memory for a psychedelic-like experience. Although we think it to be highly unlikely, if full and lasting therapeutic efficacy remained under these conditions, we would concede that the subjective effects are irrelevant."
77,10.1021/acsptsci.0c00192,"Until recently, it was unknown if nonhallucinogenic psychoplastogens could produce beneficial behavioral effects comparable to psychedelics. Through careful chemical design, we were able to engineer tabernanthalog (TBG)—a nonhallucinogenic analogue of 5-MeO-DMT that promotes cortical neuron structural plasticity through activation of 5-HT2A receptors.33 Like psychedelic compounds, TBG has demonstrated preclinical therapeutic effects suggesting that it might be effective at treating a range of neuropsychiatric diseases including depression, alcohol use disorder, and heroin use disorder.33 Future work needs to address why functionally selective 5-HT2A receptor ligands such as TBG can produce plasticity and therapeutic behavioral responses without inducing behavioral effects characteristic of classic psychedelics Ultimately, clinical trials will be necessary to determine if psychoplastogenic analogues of psychedelics can produce therapeutic effects in humans without inducing mystical-like experiences. Additionally, there are several other experiments that could potentially be performed to elucidate the roles of both subjective effects and enhanced neural plasticity in the therapeutic properties of psychedelics. One option is to employ a compound producing mystical-like effects without promoting neuronal growth in the PFC as a true active placebo. However, no such compound has been identified yet, and such a compound might not even exist if hallucinogenic effects inevitably lead to enhanced neural plasticity Alternatively, psychedelics could be administered to patients under anesthesia. This would solve the blinding issue by preventing patients from experiencing the altered state of consciousness. Such an experimental design could be a powerful way to dissociate the psychological from the neurobiological effects of these drugs. However, care must be taken in the design of such studies, as several common anesthetics are known to promote neural plasticity and produce antidepressant effects themselves To the best of my knowledge, no clinical trial has administered a classic serotonergic psychedelic after the induction of general anesthesia. However, several studies have demonstrated that intraoperative ketamine can improve postoperative mood despite the fact that patients were unconscious during ketamine administration.34−36 While this suggests that ketamine-induced mystical experiences may not be necessary to produce therapeutic responses, the patients in these studies were not severely depressed. Thus, studies administering ketamine under general anesthesia to patients with major depressive disorder are warranted, and at least one such study is currently ongoing While preliminary evidence suggests that the subjective effects of psychedelics are not necessary to produce therapeutic responses, they may be critical for achieving maximal efficacy. Though the strong positive correlation between mystical-type experiences and the strength of therapeutic responses does not imply causation, it does implicate either psychological mechanisms or perhaps an exceptionally strong placebo effect in the impressive effect sizes observed following psychedelic-assisted therapy. Thus, the combination of a pharmacologically induced state of heightened neural plasticity with a profound subjective experience could prove invaluable for treating those who are especially ill or who have attempted other treatments without success Despite the promising therapeutic responses produced by psychedelic-assisted therapy, the intense subjective effects of these drugs make it unlikely that they will ever become widespread treatments for disorders such as depression. In contrast, strategies for rewiring pathological neural circuitry without producing psychedelic-like mystical effects hold enormous promise as potential first-line treatments for a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. Regardless, nonhallucinogenic analogues of psychedelics will provide a wealth of information about the fundamental neurobiology underlying both compound-induced neural plasticity and hallucinogenic effects.

78,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112749,"The current meta-analysis evaluated effects of psilocybin coupled with supportive behavioral interventions on anxiety and depression. Although a small number of studies were included, available data were promising. Within-group effects at post-treatment and six-month follow-up showed large reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms with no evidence of publication bias. Qualitative assessment of risk of bias was more concerning, with high risk in several domains. High between-study heterogeneity suggests there may be systematic variation across the studies. Future meta-analyses should examine study features (e.g., psilocybin dose) as moderators of treatment effects Effects of psilocybin on anxiety and depression were also evident in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Effect sizes (gs = 0.82 to 0.83 for psilocybin vs. placebo) are similar to psychological interventions versus no treatment (d = 0.80; Wampold and Imel, 2015) and cognitive behavioral therapy versus no treatment (d = 0.82; Butler et al., 2006). Given both psilocybin and placebo groups received equivalent behavioral interventions, the additive benefit of psilocybin may be substantial. However, this effect was not robust to publication bias, highlighting the need for further placebo-controlled studies. As supportive behavioral interventions were included in all studies, results cannot be interpreted to indicate general benefits associated with the use of psilocybin in the absence of support Additional large-scale studies examining the effects of psilocybin on treatment-resistant depression may be warranted, as only one of the four studies focused on this population. It may be valuable to evaluate various behavioral interventions to support or extend benefits of psilocybin treatments The current meta-analysis has several limitations. Only four studies (N = 117) were available, limiting the reliability of the observed effects. Small sample studies can introduce biases (Button et al., 2013). Heterogeneity in effect sizes and design features were generally high. High risk of bias was present for most studies (performance bias and detection bias due to lack of blinding, attrition bias). Selection bias also limits generalizability of the available evidence as all participants were willing to receive a Schedule I substance. Three of the four studies included individuals with terminal cancer diagnoses, which may not represent anxiety and depression generally. Limited racial/ethnic diversity reduces generalizability Nonetheless, the current meta-analysis suggests psilocybin in combination with behavioral support may provide a safe and effective treatment option for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. This is an area for additional careful, scientific study",
79,10.1016/j.jcbs.2019.12.004,"A limitation of all talking therapies is that they operate through language, thus risking getting caught in its traps. The PFM model recognises these traps and tries to target the excesses of language to enhance psychological flexibility. Psychedelics provide another route to disrupting ordinary language processes that unhelpfully narrow and constrain behaviour and appear to enhance psychological flexibility, potentially more intensely and without verbal instruction. Psychedelics offer a route to embodied awareness and the relief and learning this can bring. Psychedelics also offer the opportunity for more patients to experience profound psychological change than through talking therapy alone Conversely, the PFM can inform how psychedelic preparation and integration are conducted so as to enhance and sustain change. The PFM can guide preparation to potentially enhance the effects of psilocybin dosing sessions. Afterwards, as psilocybin induced psychological flexibility waxes and wanes, acceptance-focused work can help remind patients of how they can engage with their felt sense, continuing to open up to challenging events. Perhaps most importantly, the behaviour change emphasis of the PFM can empower patients to continue to connect with new perspectives gained and prolong and deepen the behaviour change that would likely have faded without support This paper outlined how the PFM model can be used to guide psilocybin assisted therapy for depression and reviewed qualitative evidence suggesting that PFM is central to the processes of change involved in this therapeutic modality. We also reviewed how the PFM has been adapted for use in psilocybin preparation and integration and how the resulting model, called ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody), is being utilised in an ongoing clinical trial. As the PFM is now being used as the principal therapeutic modality in other studies using psilocybin to treat depression (i.e., NYU, Yale) as well, we may be at the beginning of a new phase in psychedelic assisted therapy, in which the psychotherapy component is more fully nurtured, grown, and studied. It is our hope that the psychedelic therapy models of the future will be comprehensive enough to support habits of acceptance, connection and embodiment that last a lifetime and catalyse transformational processes in individuals and the communities in which they live",
80,10.1038/s41386-020-00883-6,"The present study investigated acute effects of LSD using a range of well-defined doses in healthy subjects. Previous recent studies mostly used LSD products that were not developed according to pharmaceutical standards, as discussed elsewhere [20]. Additionally, we determined plasma LSD concentrations as measures of exposure to the substance in the body that are a prerequisite for a valid dose-finding study. We used LSD doses in the psychedelic effect dose range (25–200 µg of LSD base) that were expected to induce full subjective effects of LSD as previously reported by comparable studies that used single-dose levels [4, 10,11,12]. Plasma LSD concentrations increased proportionally with increasing doses and decreased according to first-order elimination. The PK parameters were consistent with single-dose studies [20, 31]. A preliminary report of a longer terminal elimination half-life of LSD [32] was not confirmed in the present study. We found no sex differences in LSD concentrations or effects consistent with previous studies using no body weight adjustment of LSD doses [20, 31, 32] LSD dose-dependently increased subjective effects that were largely similar to previous studies that used single-dose levels [10,11,12,13, 26]. Importantly, a ceiling effect was reached at higher doses of LSD (>100 µg) with regard to its positive subjective effects, with no difference in good drug effects between the 100 and 200 µg doses. However, the 200 µg dose of LSD produced significantly greater ego dissolution and anxious ego dissolution than the 100 µg dose. Additionally, only the 200 µg dose and not the 100 µg dose of LSD-induced significant anxiety. However, doses above 100 µg may be used if the goal is to induce the experience of ego dissolution or disembodiment. These experiences, however, were produced at doses that also produced more anxiety compared with lower doses. LSD doses of 100 and 200 µg were both subjectively identified as high doses but could not be subjectively distinguished with certainty from each other. Both of these doses can clearly be considered full psychedelic doses and have previously been investigated in healthy subjects [11, 12]. No previous studies directly compared LSD doses of 100 and 200 µg. In contrast to the present findings, we previously reported moderately greater effects of a 200 µg dose of LSD in one study [12] compared with 100 µg in another study [11]. Specifically, 200 µg LSD produced significantly greater total scores on the 5D-ASC scale, including higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts compared with 100 µg [26]. In a previous study, the 200 µg dose of LSD also produced higher ratings of good drug effects, bad drug effects, fear, open, and trust on the VAS compared with 100 µg [11]. There are two explanations for the absence of an LSD dose response for good drug effects in the present study compared with our previous studies. First, the true doses that were used in the previous studies were 60–70 and 150 µg rather than the reported 100 and 200 µg doses because of the use of an unstable formulation with a lower LSD content, as discussed elsewhere [20]. Second, the past comparison was between different subjects and studies [11, 26], whereas the present study used valid within-subject and within-study comparisons. In the present study, we observed a ceiling effect on the dose–response curve. Considering that the previously reported 200 µg dose likely contained only 150 µg of active LSD, additional positive effects may be reached with 150 µg compared with 100 µg. This possibility remains to be tested. One of our recent studies also used an analytically confirmed LSD dose of 100 µg, which produced scores on the VAS and 5D-ASC scale that were nominally higher than those that were reported after 100 µg administration in the present study [13] and more similar to the scores that were reported herein after 200 µg administration. Altogether, the available data support the view that mainly high acute positive effects of LSD can be induced at a 100 µg dose of LSD base. Therefore, we speculate that a dose of 100 µg of LSD may be selected for the treatment of depression or anxiety where higher Oceanic Boundlessness and lower anxiety ratings acutely induced by psychedelics predicted better treatment efficacy [16,17,18,19]. The 50 µg dose that was used in the present study also produced substantial positive mood effects and notably only very small and nonsignificant anxious ego dissolution, with no anxiety. Thus, the 50 µg dose may be useful for inducing a moderately intense and predominantly positive psychedelic experience. This low psychedelic dose would likely be a good starting dose to be used in patients with no previous experience with psychedelics or in subjects who are considered to be more sensitive to the effects of psychedelics [33] In the present study, LSD produced moderate elevations of arterial blood pressure and heart rate starting at the 50 µg dose that were largely similar to the effects of 100 and 200 µg. Similarly, previous studies that used pharmaceutically not well-characterized doses of 100 and 200 µg LSD found no difference in the acute cardiostimulant effects of these doses [11]. A previous study in patients did not observe any increases in blood pressure using a non-confirmed dose of 200 µg of LSD [34]. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine clearly has more pronounced cardiostimulant effects and a less favorable overall physical safety profile than LSD [13, 35]. In contrast, the psychotropic effects of LSD are significantly greater compared with MDMA [13] In the present study, administration of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin 1 h before LSD administration markedly reduced the subjective response to the 200 µg LSD dose to levels that were similar to the 25 µg dose. Retrospective reports showed that ketanserin and LSD together were identified correctly by the participants or mistaken as a low dose of LSD but never mistaken for a high dose of LSD. The present findings are consistent with a previous study in which ketanserin administration prior to the administration of 100 µg LSD almost completely prevented the acute effects of LSD [4]. These findings support the view that LSD primarily produces its acute psychedelic effects in humans via 5-HT2A receptor activation [3,4,5, 36], which was also shown for a high and fully psychedelic dose of LSD. Ketanserin also prevented acute adverse effects of LSD and the LSD-induced heart rate response. However, the weak blood pressure-elevating effects of LSD were only transiently prevented by ketanserin and reappeared later during the LSD response. This observation is consistent with the relatively short half-life of ketanserin (i.e., 2 h) during the first 1–9 h following administration [37, 38] In the present study, 200 µg LSD significantly increased BDNF plasma concentration compared with placebo with a peak at 6 h. Additionally, there were nonsignificant increases in plasma BDNF after lower doses of LSD or after ketanserin with LSD. In previous studies, 100 µg LSD had no effect on BDNF plasma levels [13] up to 5 h while the psychedelic ayahuasca increased BDNF at 2 days. Further, higher BDNF levels were associated with lower depression ratings after administration of ayahuasca [39]. More research is needed to define the time course of the BDNF response and whether there is a link between psychedelics, BDNF, and the antidepressant response [39] In addition to providing dose–response data on full psychedelic doses of LSD, the present study further characterized the effects of small doses of LSD [9, 40]. The lowest dose that was used in the present study contained 25 µg of LSD base. This dose produced subjective “any drug effects” that were significantly different from placebo and retrospectively identified as LSD by the majority (>85%) of the participants. Very low doses of LSD have typically been referred to as “microdoses.” Psychedelic microdoses have been postulated to have beneficial prolonged effects on mood while producing no or only minimal acute adverse subjective effects [40,41,42,43]. Positive long-term effects of psychedelic microdoses remain to be documented [42], and remaining unclear are the LSD doses that actually have no acute subjective effects and thus could be considered microdoses [40]. Very low to low doses of LSD were recently studied in two placebo-controlled trials [9, 21, 44, 45]. One study also provided preliminary PK data [45]. In older healthy volunteers, 5–20 µg of LSD tartrate produced small but significant linear dose-dependent increases in ratings of all of the following: subjective drug effects, vigilance reduction, dizziness, and changes in body feeling [21, 45]. The frequency of adverse effects of LSD at doses up to 20 µg was not different from placebo. The mean plasma Cmax values of LSD (non-compartmental analyses) were 0.44 ng/ml (n = 8) after the administration of 20 µg of LSD tartrate [45] and 0.51 ng/ml after the administration of 25 µg of LSD base in the present study, indicating comparable dose-proportional peak concentrations. The previous study included younger healthy subjects and found dose-dependent increases in subjective ratings of “feel drug” and “like drug” on VASs and on the 5D-ASC scale after the administration of 6.5, 13, and 26 µg of LSD tartrate [9]. Notably, a 26 µg dose of LSD tartrate would be lower than the 25 µg dose of LSD base (i.e., 31 µg of LSD tartrate equivalent) that was used in the present study. Nevertheless, the 26 µg dose of LSD tartrate produced significant effects on the 5D-ASC scale compared with placebo and nominally greater ratings on the 5D-ASC subscales than the 25 µg dose that was used in the present study. Unfortunately, no plasma LSD concentration data have been published for the 26 µg dose of LSD tartrate [9]. Therefore, a comparison of drug exposures between this previous study and the present study to further validate the dose comparison is not possible. Altogether, the available data from these controlled studies, including the present study that used very small and small doses of LSD, indicate that the 25 µg dose of LSD is clearly acutely psychoactive in the majority of subjects. Doses in the range of 21–30 µg of LSD base may thus be considered “minidoses” rather than “microdoses.” Doses of LSD base in the 1–20 µg range may be considered “microdoses” but need further study. However, these doses may already elicit small dose-dependent subjective effects, although they are unlikely to relevantly impair cognition or produce adverse effects [9, 21, 44, 45] Overall, the present dose–response study characterized a range of LSD doses. Based on the available data, the following dosing terminology may be useful for future LSD research: “microdose” (1–20 µg), “minidose” (21–30 µg), and “psychedelic dose” (>30 µg). Within the psychedelic LSD dose range, good effects likely predominate at doses of 30–100 µg (good-effect dose), whereas ego dissolution and anxiety increase at doses above 100 µg (ego-dissolution dose) The present study has numerous strengths. Four different doses of LSD were used within subjects and compared with placebo under double-blind conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. A ketanserin-LSD condition was also included to elucidate the mechanism of action of LSD and enhance blinding between the different conditions. We also included equal numbers of male and female participants and used internationally established standardized and validated psychometric outcome measures. The doses of LSD were pharmaceutically well-characterized, and plasma LSD concentrations and PK parameters were determined up to 24 h for all doses. Notwithstanding these strengths, the present study also has limitations. The study used a highly controlled setting and included only healthy subjects. Additionally, participants willing to participate in LSD research are likely to have positive expectations and some participants had past substance experiences. Thus, subjects in different environments and patients with psychiatric disorders may respond differently to LSD","We characterized the effects of LSD at different doses to support the dosing of LSD for research and LSD-assisted therapy. LSD exhibited dose-proportional PKs and first-order elimination. It produced significant dose-dependent subjective responses starting at the 25 µg dose. A ceiling effect was observed for good drug effects at the 100 µg dose. The 200 µg dose induced more ego dissolution but also more anxiety than the 100 µg dose. These results may assist with dose finding for future LSD research. Ketanserin almost completely prevented the response to the high (200 µg) dose of LSD, thus confirming the critical role of 5-HT2A receptors in mediating psychedelic effects of LSD."
81,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.12.001,"Evidence from carefully designed and performed open and controlled trials involving the administration of single or few doses of serotoninergic hallucinogens suggests that these compounds have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties that should be further investigated in controlled trials with larger samples sizes. Importantly, the incidence of severe adverse reactions such as psychotic episodes in these trials is extremely low or nonexistent, which is based on careful screening, preparation of the subject and of the experimental context, and monitoring during drug effects. Furthermore, evidence from observational studies on the physical and mental health of ritual ayahuasca users suggest a low toxicity profile for this practice, and even suggests benefits on mood, anxiety, a substance use disorders In 2018 the investigation of psilocybin as a possible treatment for treatment-resistant MDD received the Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, and similar trials are planned to occur in Europe (Anon., 2018). If these trials show positive results, the carefully controlled use of psilocybin can become available for treating MDD in the US and Europe, which could later expand to the off-label and compassionate use of psilocybin in cancer-related depression and anxiety and maybe in other medical conditions characterized by mood and anxiety symptoms. The therapeutic use of LSD should follow the same steps as those of psilocybin In the case of ayahuasca, indigenous and mestizo communities of the Northwestern Amazon and Brazilian syncretic religions have been using it ritually and therapeutically for generations, and these practices are continuously evolving into new forms and expanding to new territories. If the clinical trials with ayahuasca continue to show positive results, regulatory agencies worldwide (including in Brazil) may be faced with the challenge of regulating a plant-based hallucinogen/psychedelic It should also be considered that a synthetic equivalent of ayahuasca could be developed (for example by combing harmine with DMT), which could bypass the complexities of a plant-based preparation. Chemical changes in the DMT molecule could allow its oral absorption. While the use of synthetic equivalents may be unacceptable to some people involved in the religious ayahuasca practices, it may be a more practical way to have the medicine become approved for use in patients. However, legislations regarding the use of purified DMT are very restrict. Thus, the use of a plant-based preparation that is already allowed in some countries could be the fastest and cheapest way to make the medicine reach the population. Moreover, the ritual users of ayahuasca developed over the generations techniques to use ayahuasca in a safe manner. This could also facilitate the incorporation of ayahuasca as a medicine, at least in countries were these religious groups are present Mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders are among the most important contributors to global disability. Available medications are ineffective for many patients, induce significant adverse reactions, and need weeks of daily intake before therapeutic effects appear. Therefore, new drugs with rapid onset of action and sustained effects after single or few doses could be beneficial for many patients Moreover, although ketamine (which also has hallucinogenic/psychedelic effects and has been recently approved by the FDA to treat MDD) has a rapid onset of action and enduring effects, its use may be associated with tolerance, potential for dependence and diversion, and urinary adverse events (Radvansky et al., 2016; CADTH, 2019). None of these problems have been observed in trials with serotoninergic hallucinogen, but long-term studies are lacking. Further clinical trials using different doses of serotoninergic hallucinogens and larger samples are necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of these drugs, as well as naturalistic studies of large populations of ritual ayahuasca regular users",
82,10.1038/s41386-020-0718-8,"The present study demonstrates the first attempt to assess the acute effects of psilocybin on glutamate levels in key areas of the human brain, which may play a major role in the actions of serotonergic psychedelics. Using an ultra-high field multimodal MRI approach, we demonstrated that, compared with placebo, psilocybin-induced region-dependent alterations in neurometabolite concentrations. Specifically, participants who received psilocybin demonstrated higher relative glutamate concentration levels in the mPFC, and lower relative glutamate concentration levels in the hippocampus. Analyses indicated that region-dependent alterations in glutamate were also correlated with different dimensions of ego dissolution. Whereas changes in mPFC glutamate were found to be the strongest predictor of negatively experienced ego dissolution, changes in hippocampal glutamate were found to be the strongest predictor of positively experienced ego dissolution Previous studies have demonstrated that the mPFC is highly enriched with 5-HT2A receptors located primarily on layer V pyramidal neurons [61], and modulate excitatory transmission in cortical circuits [43, 62, 63]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of such receptors via serotonergic psychedelics results in a predominantly excitatory response [18, 64] via an increase in glutamate release, as observed in humans for the first time in this study. A glutamatergic increase in this area is also in accordance with human functional imaging studies which have demonstrated a hyperfrontal regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) pattern after psilocybin [46, 65], and similar 5-HT2A agonist psychedelics [66, 67] However, we also found that psilocybin administration was associated with higher levels of GABA in this area, results in line with findings that 5-HT2A receptors are also located on GABAergic interneurons [17, 68]. Taken together, findings suggest that activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the mPFC results in both excitation and inhibition of cortical pyramidal cells [17], potentially resulting in an increased metabolic rate in this area, but not necessarily increased neural input or output In contrast to the mPFC, the present study demonstrated that participants who received psilocybin demonstrated lower relative glutamate concentrations in the hippocampus, suggesting that psilocybin decreases glutamate in this area. Such a decrease is in line with data from a recent functional imaging study with psilocybin, demonstrating reduced absolute CBF in the hippocampus compared with placebo [69], of which the authors proposed two potential mechanisms. Namely, decrements could be due to agonism of 5-HT2A receptors located on GABAergic interneurons [44], which can indirectly inhibit pyramidal neurons, decreasing activation in this area. Conversely, it has also been established that, along with the 5-HT2A receptor, psilocin also has a high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor [70, 71]. Referred to as serotonin’s principal inhibitory receptor [72], the 5-HT1A receptors highest density is found in the limbic regions of the brain such as the hippocampus [73] where it is expressed on neurons that are postsynaptic to the serotonergic input. Thus lower levels in glutamate as seen in this study, as well as regional decreases reflected in others [69], could be due to activation of postsynaptic inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors Nevertheless, due to methodological limitations, this study is not able to delineate which mechanism is contributing to the lower levels in glutamate. Further information could have been potentially gained from quantification of GABA in the hippocampus, however we were unable to reliably do so, due to inherent quantification challenges when assessing GABA levels, arising from low brain concentration levels, metabolite signal overlap, and low signal-to-noise in the hippocampus [74, 75]. Future studies with sequences developed to specifically quantify GABA in low signal-to-noise areas should make further attempts to do so, given recent research implicating hippocampal GABA in the pathology of disorders that psychedelics are being investigated to treat [76] In the current study, psilocybin induced previously established key features of a psychedelic experience: increases in feelings of ego dissolution, and disrupted RSN activity. Psilocybin increased scores on all dimensions of the 5D-ASC [16], as well as on the EDI [1]. In addition, psilocybin altered within-network FC similarly as has been shown with LSD, including decrements in coactivation within the DMN, visual network 1, and the auditory network [32, 33]. Finally, we demonstrated higher between-network FC across all networks, which is similar with previous studies assessing the same after psilocybin [35, 42] and LSD Finally, we assessed the relationship between psilocybin-induced changes in the brain, and the subjective experience of sense of self. Canonical correlations were conducted to predict increases in ratings of AED, the dimension encompassing the loss of autonomy and self-control of thought processes, intentionality, decision making, and spontaneous movements [46]. Our data support the conclusion that increasing levels of mPFC glutamate were the strongest predictor in regards to feelings of AED, with decreasing anterior DMN FC and hippocampal glutamate being secondary predictors. These findings are in line with previous work, implicating increased frontal metabolism in feelings of AED after psilocybin [46] and ego pathology in the ketamine model of psychosis [77]. Interestingly, AED-associated changes in mood include paranoia, heightened arousal and attention to the surroundings, and anxiety [46]. A paradoxical effect of serotonergic psychedelics is that acutely they have been found to increase feelings of anxiety [6, 78], whereas clinical trials with psychedelic drugs suggest long-term anxiety relief in patients [11, 12, 14]. Accordingly, there is a wide range of animal and human pharmacological evidence supporting the role of the glutamatergic system in anxiety [79], with increases in glutamate in the frontal cortex associated with high versus low state-trait anxiety [80], and reductions corresponding to anxiety-related symptomatic relief [81]. Taken together, the finding that mPFC glutamate was by far the strongest predictor of increased feelings of anxiety, one could propose that acute psychedelic-induced anxiety may be due to localized glutamate-induced hyperfrontality, whereas long-term reductions could be due to agonist-induced 5-HT2A receptor downregulation in this area [72, 82]. Nonetheless, future studies should assess long-term changes in 5-HT2A receptor function in the mPFC, and their relation with subjective effects We also assessed the relationship between psilocybin-induced brain changes and feelings of positively experienced ego dissolution, including ratings on the EDI, and scores of OB on the 5D-ASC. We found that the primary predictor of positively experienced ego dissolution was a decrement in hippocampal glutamate, with secondary contributions of mPFC glutamate and posterior DMN integrity. Previous work has implicated both the MTL (containing the hippocampus) and DMN circuitry in the neural correlates of the self [49]. Namely, abnormal function of MTL regions have been implicated in psychotic states [83, 84] and feelings of depersonalization [85] and ego-disturbances [86]. Similarly, studies of drug-induced ego dissolution have found that the decoupling of MTL regions such as the parahippocampus and the DMN correlate positively with feelings of ego dissolution [49, 87], with this decoupling being hypothesized to be one of the main underlying mechanisms of the subjective experience [47,48,49]. In regards to why this gives rise to ego dissolution, it has been suggested that psychedelic drug-induced decoupling of these regions results in a temporary loss of access of semantic autobiographical information, resulting in a breakdown of one’s personal identity [87]. Our data add to this hypothesis, suggesting that modulations of hippocampal glutamate in particular may be a key mediator in the decoupling underlying feelings of (positive) ego dissolution. Interestingly, although the DMN has been the most implicated RSN in this process, Lebedev et al. [49] found that increases in ego dissolution correlated with decreased FC between the parahippocampal formation and other major networks, such as the salience, frontoparietal, and sensorimotor network; suggesting a key role in this area in particular, as our data also demonstrate. However future research should further assess the contribution of other areas to this experience, such as the posterior cingulate cortex Implications of these findings also extend far beyond understanding the neurobiology of the acute psychedelic experience and drug-induced ego dissolution. There is growing evidence that psychedelics can provide therapeutic relief for individuals suffering from increasingly common and difficult to treat disorders such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorders [4, 9, 11, 88, 89]. Thus understanding the mechanisms by which psychedelics provide symptomatic relief may identify novel therapeutic targets. Interestingly, the degree of ego dissolution has been found to correlate with long-term clinical outcomes [90] and increases in well-being [10, 91]. In addition, a hypothetical (neurobiological) model has been proposed to explain the long-term effects witnessed in clinical trials. It has been suggested that indirect activation of glutamate networks via 5-HT2A receptor agonism increases BDNF, and ultimately enhances neuroplasticity [16]. In line with this, it has been shown in preclinical models that psychedelics increase functional and structural neuroplasticity [92], however evidence in humans is limited, due to restrictions of methodological techniques. Our data provide indirect evidence that psychedelics might have the potential to increase neuroplasticity in the human cortex via increased glutamatergic activity, but not in the hippocampus; findings that are in accordance with previous 5-HT2A receptor activation studies [27, 93, 94]. In addition, psilocybin administration was associated with higher levels of mPFC NAA, a compound regarded as a measure of neuronal viability and function, and decreased in disorders associated with regional neuronal loss and disrupted neuronal function Of note, compared to previous psychedelic studies, the dose administered was low to moderate [96], and thus not high enough to induce total ego dissolution. However, the aim of this study was not to assess maximal effects of psilocybin, but rather an effective dose that would induce a relevant psychedelic state that participants could endure in the MRI scanner. Our data demonstrate that the dose was effective, inducing significantly higher levels of both positively and negatively experienced ego dissolution compared with placebo, as well as the other subjective effects representative of a psychedelic state (Figs. 1, S1). Furthermore, although BOLD sensitivity is increased by the use of ultra-high magnetic fields, geometric distortions become more prominent, which could have affected our BOLD signal in inferior brain regions [97], and our scan time was arguably short from a test–retest reliability standpoint [98]. Nevertheless, our results are similar to aforementioned studies [32, 33, 35, 42] who acquired their data at a lower field strength, with varying scanning lengths. Finally, an inherent difficulty of studying substances with such salient subjective effects is maintaining the treatment blind. Thus, it could be suggested that participant recognition of the treatment condition could affect neural and subjective results, emphasizing the importance of active placebo conditions or cross-psychotropic comparisons in future trials In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the serotonergic psychedelic, psilocybin, acutely induces region dependent alterations in glutamate that correlate with established behavioral changes during the psychedelic state. Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic state, and importantly, provide a neurochemical basis for how these substances alter individuals’ sense of self, and may be giving rise to therapeutic effects witnessed in ongoing clinical trials",
83,10.1016/j.bpsc.2019.12.007,"In this study, we tested the effects of a very low “microdose” of LSD (13 μg) on resting state connectivity in healthy human volunteers. We found that LSD increased amygdala seed-based connectivity with the right angular gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and the cerebellum, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the left and right postcentral gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. Although the drug’s effects on mood were small and variable, the increase in amygdala – middle frontal gyrus connectivity strength was positively correlated with positive mood after the drug. No changes in CBF were recorded. Despite the growing popularity of the practice of microdosing in the community and handful of studies investigating the subjective and behavioral effects of microdoses of LSD, to our knowledge this the first study to investigate the effects of a very low dose of the drug on resting state connectivity and CBF Our results are in line with previous studies investigating changes in amygdala responses under the influence of higher doses of LSD and other psychedelics, including psilocybin. The amygdala receives inputs from all manner of sensory information-focused areas and prefrontal cortex, and the latter is also a target of amygdala afferents, making the interpretation of results involving amygdala connectivity a complex process. Nonetheless, our study is consistent with prior work showing reduced amygdala system modulation. Using a much higher dose of LSD (100 μg compared to 13 μg) Mueller (15) reported dampened amygdala responses to fearful facial expressions and Kraehenmann (13) found similar results with the serotonergic drug psilocybin. Grimm (18) found that psilocybin not only modulated amygdala activation, but also decreased amygdala connectivity to the frontal pole during the viewing of happy faces, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the striatum during the viewing of angry faces. Though Grimm (18) investigated task-based connectivity and our study investigated resting-state connectivity, our result that LSD decreases connectivity between the amygdala and the superior temporal gyrus, a region shown to be involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli (30), is of interest in light of these previous findings. Notably, however, the previous studies used substantially higher doses of the drugs, and it is of particular interest that we detected these changes in neural function at doses of LSD that produce minimal direct subjective or behavioral effects and do not alter CBF Amygdala hyperreactivity has been associated with a host of psychiatric disorders involving negative processing bias, including major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders (31, 32). Further, standard antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) act acutely to dampen, and thereby normalize, disrupted amygdala responses, which may be a mechanism underlying their efficacy (33, 34). The extent to which microdoses of LSD or other serotonin agonists dampen amygdala activity and connectivity, after either acute or repeated dosing, and how these are related to mood symptoms remain an important direction for future research Interestingly, we also observed increased connectivity between the amygdala and middle frontal gyrus, right angular gyrus, and cerebellum. Beyond dampening amygdala responses to negative stimuli, it has been suggested that SSRIs may act by enhancing cortico-limbic connectivity in the brain, thereby facilitating appropriate emotion regulation (35). In line with these findings, in our study, changes in amygdala-middle frontal gyrus connectivity were significantly correlated with changes in positive mood. Furthermore, reduced connectivity between the right amygdala and the cerebellum has been reported in depressed patients (36). These alterations in connectivity have been suggested to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression given that dysfunctions in cerebellar-limbic circuits have been shown to disrupt emotional processing (36, 37). In a future study it will be important to determine whether small doses of LSD normalize decreased amygdala-cerebellar connectivity in depressed patients In contrast to LSD-induced changes in amygdala connectivity, we did not find alterations in thalamo-cortical connectivity. This is not surprising given that altered information processing in thalamo-cortical loops has been suggested to underlie the psychedelic-induced altered state of consciousness (9). The “microdose” used in this study did not induce psychedelic symptoms or an altered state of consciousness and may therefore not influence these pathways, but rather change information processing in emotional networks Our study design had several limitations. First, our study included only healthy volunteers, and the effects of the drug on mood or brain function may be different in individuals with symptoms of depression or anxiety. Second, we investigated effects of only a single administration of LSD, whereas individuals who “microdose” the drug in real-world settings report using the drug repeatedly, every 3 or 4 days. Whether drug produces different effects on brain activity or mood after repeated doses remains to be determined. Another limitation is that we did not examine subjects’ responses to behavioral tasks implicated in mood-enhancing effects of drugs such as tasks assessing cognitive and emotion processing. Finally, perhaps because of the low dose, the effects of the drug were subtle. For example, we detected correlations between mood and connectivity in both the placebo and drug conditions. The specificity of the effect to the drug condition will await further study with additional subjects and repeated dosing In summary, here we report the results of the first study to investigate the effects of a very low, “microdose” of LSD on resting state functional connectivity in a sample of healthy human volunteers. We describe changes in amygdala connectivity in brain regions that are implicated in depression. It remains to be determined with repeated doses of this low-dose drug result in antidepressant effects. These promising findings provide a good basis for pursuing the efficacy of low doses of serotonin agonists in psychiatric treatment",
84,10.1021/acschemneuro.9b00493,"Despite having a rudimentary default mode network, (34) and showing interest in mirrors, video feed, and still images of other rats, (35) rats are not commonly believed to be among the menagerie of self-aware animals. Thus, as far as modern science is able to determine, rats do not have a sense of self and are incapable of having existential anxiety, pondering the meaning behind their own existence or fearing a reality in which they, as individuals, do not exist. No one knows what the subjective experience of a rat is after being given a psychedelic, but it is highly unlikely that they are able to place that within the context of their life experiences and utilize that knowledge therapeutically to improve their affective state. Therefore, because psilocybin has robust effects similar to those of other antidepressants in rats that is very long lasting, which is similar to the long lasting antidepressant effects of psilocybin to alleviate the symptoms of depression in humans, we posit that the basis for the antidepressant effects in humans is at its core biological in nature, and that while correlated to antidepressant effect (27) peak ego dissolution subjective experiences following psilocybin administration is not causational to antidepressant effect. These biological processes could include cellular proliferation, increased synaptic connectivity, and anti-inflammatory effects. Drugs like LSD and psilocybin have been demonstrated to elicit these types of changes in preclinical models, and these types of physiological effects have each been associated with antidepressant-like behavioral outcomes. (32,36) Although we propose that the antidepressant-like effects are primarily rooted in biological processes, our data suggest that post drug administration environmental factors also play a critical role in overall drug effects. Our results suggest that psilocybin facilitates a period of behavioral flexibility in which exploration of a non-home-cage environment reduces their anxiety during future exploration of a novel environment (the EPM, Figure 3A), but FST evaluation 1 week after psilocybin blunts the antidepressant-like effect in the FST (Figure 2A,F,G). In this context, psilocybin may open a window during which time certain experiences are salient to the development of new coping strategies, similar to MDMA-facilitated social learning reported in mice. (37) As the FST measures the coping strategies of rodents challenged with the threat of drowning, successfully surviving the first trial by floating may make rats given psilocybin more likely to use this coping strategy in the future, whereas rats given psilocybin and not subjected to FST for 5 weeks choose active coping strategies. Interestingly, that is not true of ketamine, as ketamine’s antidepressant-like effect was independent of repeated FST, but transient (Figure 2D,G) and no anxiolytic effect was observed (Figure 3C). Therefore, overall efficacy in humans is likely a combination of both the acute neurological effects of the drug and subjective, contextual experiences during and/or immediately following the drug administration session","The antidepressant-like and anxiolytic effects of psychedelics are measurable and significant in males of a rat experimental system that has been used by several other groups over many decades for the study of mood disorders in humans. These effects are evident many weeks after administration, are more persistent than those of ketamine, and are modulated by the rats’ experiences in the first week following administration. The more persistent therapeutic effects of a single administration of psilocybin compared to ketamine in our experimental system support the notion that serotonin 5-HT2A receptor directed therapeutic strategies may be superior to ketamine-based treatments in the clinic for depression. Finally, our experimental rodent system, which recapitulates the major features of psilocybin to treat depression in human patients, may represent a valuable system to utilize for the elucidation of molecular, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the ability of psilocybin to produce the robust and long lasting antidepressant effects found in human clinical trials toward developing new and effective therapeutic strategies for treating depression."
